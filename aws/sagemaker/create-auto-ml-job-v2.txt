CREATE-AUTO-ML-JOB-V2()                                CREATE-AUTO-ML-JOB-V2()



NAME
       create-auto-ml-job-v2 -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Autopilot  job also referred to as Autopilot experiment or
       AutoML job V2.

       NOTE:
              CreateAutoMLJobV2 and DescribeAutoMLJobV2 are  new  versions  of
              CreateAutoMLJob  and DescribeAutoMLJob which offer backward com-
              patibility.

              CreateAutoMLJobV2 can manage tabular problem types identical  to
              those  of  its  previous  version  CreateAutoMLJob  , as well as
              non-tabular problem types such as image or text classification.

          Find guidelines about how to migrate a CreateAutoMLJob to  CreateAu-
          toMLJobV2 in Migrate a CreateAutoMLJob to CreateAutoMLJobV2 .

       For  the list of available problem types supported by CreateAutoMLJobV2
       , see AutoMLProblemTypeConfig .

       You can find the best-performing model after you run an AutoML  job  V2
       by calling DescribeAutoMLJobV2 .

OPTIONS
       --auto-ml-job-name (string)
          Identifies an Autopilot job. The name must be unique to your account
          and is case insensitive.

       --auto-ml-job-input-data-config (list)
          An array of channel objects describing the input data and their  lo-
          cation.  Each  channel  is  a  named  input  source.  Similar to the
          InputDataConfig attribute in the CreateAutoMLJob  input  parameters.
          The supported formats depend on the problem type:

          o For tabular problem types: S3Prefix , ManifestFile .

          o For image classification: S3Prefix , ManifestFile , AugmentedMani-
            festFile .

          o For text classification: S3Prefix .

          o For time-series forecasting: S3Prefix .

          (structure)
              A channel is a named input source that training  algorithms  can
              consume.  This  channel is used for AutoML jobs V2 (jobs created
              by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ).

              ChannelType -> (string)
                 The type of channel. Defines whether the data  are  used  for
                 training or validation. The default value is training . Chan-
                 nels for training and validation must share the same Content-
                 Type

                 NOTE:
                     The type of channel defaults to training for the time-se-
                     ries forecasting problem type.

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The content type of the data from the input source. The  fol-
                 lowing are the allowed content types for different problems:

                 o For tabular problem types: text/csv;header=present or x-ap-
                   plication/vnd.amazon+parquet  .  The   default   value   is
                   text/csv;header=present .

                 o For  image  classification: image/png , image/jpeg , or im-
                   age/* . The default value is image/* .

                 o For text classification: text/csv;header=present  or  x-ap-
                   plication/vnd.amazon+parquet   .   The   default  value  is
                   text/csv;header=present .

                 o For  time-series  forecasting:  text/csv;header=present  or
                   x-application/vnd.amazon+parquet  .  The  default  value is
                   text/csv;header=present .

              CompressionType -> (string)
                 The allowed compression types depend on the input format  and
                 problem type. We allow the compression type Gzip for S3Prefix
                 inputs on tabular data only. For all other inputs,  the  com-
                 pression type should be None . If no compression type is pro-
                 vided, we default to None .

              DataSource -> (structure)
                 The data source for an AutoML channel (Required).

                 S3DataSource -> (structure)
                     The Amazon S3 location of the input data.

                     S3DataType -> (string)
                        The data type.

                        o If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a key name
                          prefix.  SageMaker  uses  all objects that match the
                          specified key name prefix for  model  training.  The
                          S3Prefix   should   have   the   following   format:
                          s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER-OR-FILE

                        o If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri identifies an ob-
                          ject  that  is  a manifest file containing a list of
                          object keys that you want SageMaker to use for model
                          training.  A  ManifestFile  should  have  the format
                          shown   below:    [    {"prefix":    "s3://DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DOC-EXAMPLE-PREFIX/"},
                          "DOC-EXAMPLE-RELATIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-FOLDER/DATA-1",               "DOC-EXAMPLE-RELA-
                          TIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DATA-2",            ...
                          "DOC-EXAMPLE-RELATIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-FOLDER/DATA-N" ]

                        o If you choose AugmentedManifestFile , S3Uri  identi-
                          fies an object that is an augmented manifest file in
                          JSON lines format. This file contains the  data  you
                          want  to  use for model training. AugmentedManifest-
                          File is available for V2 API jobs only (for example,
                          for  jobs  created  by  calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ).
                          Here is a minimal, single-record example of an  Aug-
                          mentedManifestFile :  {"source-ref": "s3://DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/cats/cat.jpg",    "la-
                          bel-metadata":  {"class-name":  "cat" } For more in-

                          Dataset  Metadata to Training Jobs with an Augmented
                          Manifest File .

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        The URL to the Amazon S3 data source. The  Uri  refers
                        to  the  Amazon S3 prefix or ManifestFile depending on
                        the data type.

       --auto-ml-problem-type-config (tagged union structure)
          Defines  the  configuration settings of one of the supported problem
          types.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: ImageClassificationJobConfig, TextClassi-
              ficationJobConfig,  TabularJobConfig,  TimeSeriesForecastingJob-
              Config.

          ImageClassificationJobConfig -> (structure)
              Settings  used to configure an AutoML job V2 for the image clas-
              sification problem type.

              CompletionCriteria -> (structure)
                 How long a job is allowed to run, or how  many  candidates  a
                 job is allowed to generate.

                 MaxCandidates -> (integer)
                     The  maximum number of times a training job is allowed to
                     run.

                     For text and image classification, as well as time-series
                     forecasting  problem types, the supported value is 1. For
                     tabular problem types, the maximum value is 750.

                 MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job exe-
                     cuted  inside  hyperparameter tuning is allowed to run as
                     part of a hyperparameter tuning job.  For  more  informa-
                     tion,    see    the   StoppingCondition   used   by   the
                     CreateHyperParameterTuningJob action.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     this field controls the runtime of the job candidate.

                 MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  runtime,  in  seconds, an AutoML job has to
                     complete.

                     If an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job  is
                     stopped  automatically and its processing is ended grace-
                     fully. The AutoML job identifies  the  best  model  whose
                     training  was completed and marks it as the best-perform-
                     ing model. Any unfinished steps of the job, such as auto-
                     matic  one-click Autopilot model deployment, are not com-
                     pleted.

                     For text and image classification, as well as time-series
                     forecasting problem types, the supported value is 1.  For
                     tabular problem types, the maximum value is 750.

                 MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job exe-
                     cuted inside hyperparameter tuning is allowed to  run  as
                     part  of  a  hyperparameter tuning job. For more informa-
                     tion,   see   the   StoppingCondition   used    by    the

                     this field controls the runtime of the job candidate.

                 MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum runtime, in seconds, an  AutoML  job  has  to
                     complete.

                     If  an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job is
                     stopped automatically and its processing is ended  grace-
                     fully.  The  AutoML  job  identifies the best model whose
                     training was completed and marks it as the  best-perform-
                     ing model. Any unfinished steps of the job, such as auto-
                     matic one-click Autopilot model deployment, are not  com-

              TargetLabelColumn -> (string)
                 The name of the column used to provide the class  labels.  It
                 should not be same as the content column.

          TabularJobConfig -> (structure)
              Settings  used to configure an AutoML job V2 for a tabular prob-
              lem type (regression, classification).

              CandidateGenerationConfig -> (structure)
                 The configuration information of  how  model  candidates  are
                 generated.

                     algorithms used to  train  model  candidates  on  tabular
                     data.

                     The  list  of available algorithms to choose from depends
                     on the  training  mode  set  in  `  TabularJobConfig.Mode
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_TabularJobConfig.html`__

                     o AlgorithmsConfig should not be  set  in  AUTO  training
                       mode.

                     o When AlgorithmsConfig is provided, one AutoMLAlgorithms
                       attribute must be set and one only. If the list of  al-
                       gorithms  provided  as  values  for AutoMLAlgorithms is
                       empty, CandidateGenerationConfig uses the full  set  of
                       algorithms for the given training mode.

                     o When AlgorithmsConfig is not provided, CandidateGenera-
                       tionConfig uses the full  set  of  algorithms  for  the
                       given training mode.

                     For  the  list  of  all  algorithms  per problem type and
                     training mode, see AutoMLAlgorithmConfig .

                     For more information on each algorithm, see the Algorithm
                     support section in Autopilot developer guide.

                     (structure)
                        The  collection  of  algorithms  run  on a dataset for
                        training the model candidates of an Autopilot job.

                            (string)

              CompletionCriteria -> (structure)
                 How long a job is allowed to run, or how  many  candidates  a
                 job is allowed to generate.

                 MaxCandidates -> (integer)
                     The  maximum number of times a training job is allowed to
                     run.

                     For text and image classification, as well as time-series
                     forecasting  problem types, the supported value is 1. For
                     tabular problem types, the maximum value is 750.

                 MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job exe-
                     cuted  inside  hyperparameter tuning is allowed to run as
                     part of a hyperparameter tuning job.  For  more  informa-
                     tion,    see    the   StoppingCondition   used   by   the
                     CreateHyperParameterTuningJob action.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     this field controls the runtime of the job candidate.

                 MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  runtime,  in  seconds, an AutoML job has to
                     complete.

                     If an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job  is
                     stopped  automatically and its processing is ended grace-
                     fully. The AutoML job identifies  the  best  model  whose
                     training  was completed and marks it as the best-perform-
                     ing model. Any unfinished steps of the job, such as auto-
                     matic  one-click Autopilot model deployment, are not com-
                     pleted.

              FeatureSpecificationS3Uri -> (string)
                 A URL to the Amazon S3 data source containing  selected  fea-
                 tures  from the input data source to run an Autopilot job V2.
                 You can input FeatureAttributeNames (optional) in JSON format
                 as shown below:
                     { "FeatureAttributeNames":["col1", "col2", ...] } .

                 You  can also specify the data type of the feature (optional)
                 in the format shown below:
                     { "FeatureDataTypes":{"col1":"numeric", "col2":"categori-
                     cal" ... } }

                 NOTE:
                     These column keys may not include the target column.

                 In  ensembling  mode,  Autopilot  only supports the following
                 data types: numeric , categorical , text , and datetime .  In
                 HPO  mode, Autopilot can support numeric , categorical , text
                 , datetime , and sequence .

                 If only FeatureDataTypes is provided, the column keys (col1 ,
                 col2 ,..) should be a subset of the column names in the input
                 data.

                 If both FeatureDataTypes and FeatureAttributeNames  are  pro-
                 vided,  then the column keys should be a subset of the column
                 names provided in FeatureAttributeNames .

                 The key  name  FeatureAttributeNames  is  fixed.  The  values
                 listed in ["col1", "col2", ...] are case sensitive and should
                 be a list of strings containing unique values that are a sub-
                 set  of  the column names in the input data. The list of col-
                 umns provided must not include the target column.

              Mode -> (string)
                 The method that Autopilot uses to train the data. You can ei-
                 ther  specify  the  mode manually or let Autopilot choose for
                 you based on the dataset size by selecting  AUTO  .  In  AUTO
                 mode,  Autopilot chooses ENSEMBLING for datasets smaller than
                 100 MB, and HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING for larger ones.

                 The ENSEMBLING mode uses a multi-stack ensemble model to pre-
                 dict  classification  and regression tasks directly from your
                 dataset. This machine learning  mode  combines  several  base
                 models to produce an optimal predictive model. It then uses a
                 stacking ensemble method to  combine  predictions  from  con-
                 tributing  members.  A multi-stack ensemble model can provide
                 better performance over a single model by combining the  pre-
                 dictive  capabilities of multiple models. See Autopilot algo-
                 rithm support for a list of algorithms  supported  by  ENSEM-
                 BLING mode.

                 The  HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING  (HPO) mode uses the best hyperpa-
                 rameters to train the best version of a model. HPO  automati-
                 cally  selects  an algorithm for the type of problem you want
                 to solve. Then HPO finds the best  hyperparameters  according
                 to your objective metric. See Autopilot algorithm support for
                 a list of algorithms supported by HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING mode.

              GenerateCandidateDefinitionsOnly -> (boolean)
                 Generates possible candidates without training the models.  A
                 model candidate is a combination of data preprocessors, algo-
                 rithms, and algorithm parameter settings.

              ProblemType -> (string)
                 The type of supervised learning  problem  available  for  the
                 model  candidates of the AutoML job V2. For more information,
                 see Amazon SageMaker Autopilot problem types .

                 NOTE:
                     You must either specify the type of  supervised  learning
                     problem in ProblemType and provide the AutoMLJobObjective
                     metric, or none at all.

              TargetAttributeName -> (string)
                 The name of the target variable in supervised learning,  usu-
                 ally represented by 'y'.

              SampleWeightAttributeName -> (string)
                 If  specified, this column name indicates which column of the
                 dataset should be treated as sample weights for  use  by  the
                 objective metric during the training, evaluation, and the se-
                 lection of the best model. This column is not considered as a
                 predictive  feature.  For  more information on Autopilot met-
                 rics, see Metrics and validation .

                 Sample weights should be numeric, non-negative,  with  larger
                 values  indicating which rows are more important than others.
                 Data points that have invalid or  no  weight  value  are  ex-
                 cluded.

                 Support  for  sample  weights is available in Ensembling mode
                 only.

          TimeSeriesForecastingJobConfig -> (structure)
              Settings used to configure an AutoML job V2  for  a  time-series
              forecasting problem type.

              NOTE:
                 The   TimeSeriesForecastingJobConfig  problem  type  is  only
                 available in private beta. Contact Amazon Web  Services  Sup-
                 port or your account manager to learn more about access priv-
                 ileges.

              FeatureSpecificationS3Uri -> (string)
                 A URL to the Amazon S3 data source containing additional  se-
                 lected  features  that  complement  the target, itemID, time-
                 stamp, and grouped columns set in TimeSeriesConfig . When not
                 provided, the AutoML job V2 includes all the columns from the
                 original dataset that are not already declared  in  TimeSeri-
                 esConfig  .  If  provided,  the  AutoML job V2 only considers
                 these additional columns as a complement to the ones declared
                 in TimeSeriesConfig .

                 You can input FeatureAttributeNames (optional) in JSON format
                 as shown below:
                     { "FeatureAttributeNames":["col1", "col2", ...] } .

                 You can also specify the data type of the feature  (optional)
                 in the format shown below:
                     { "FeatureDataTypes":{"col1":"numeric", "col2":"categori-
                     cal" ... } }

                 Autopilot supports the following data types: numeric ,  cate-
                 gorical , text , and datetime .

                 NOTE:
                     These  column  keys  must  not  include any column set in
                     TimeSeriesConfig .

              CompletionCriteria -> (structure)
                 How long a job is allowed to run, or how  many  candidates  a
                 job is allowed to generate.

                 MaxCandidates -> (integer)
                     The  maximum number of times a training job is allowed to
                     run.

                     For text and image classification, as well as time-series
                     forecasting  problem types, the supported value is 1. For
                     tabular problem types, the maximum value is 750.

                 MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job exe-
                     cuted  inside  hyperparameter tuning is allowed to run as
                     part of a hyperparameter tuning job.  For  more  informa-
                     tion,    see    the   StoppingCondition   used   by   the
                     CreateHyperParameterTuningJob action.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     this field controls the runtime of the job candidate.

                 MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  runtime,  in  seconds, an AutoML job has to
                     complete.

                     If an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job  is
                     stopped  automatically and its processing is ended grace-
                     fully. The AutoML job identifies  the  best  model  whose
                     training  was completed and marks it as the best-perform-
                     ing model. Any unfinished steps of the job, such as auto-
                     matic  one-click Autopilot model deployment, are not com-
                     pleted.

              ForecastFrequency -> (string)
                 The frequency of predictions in a forecast.

                 Valid intervals are  an  integer  followed  by  Y  (Year),  M
                 (Month),  W  (Week), D (Day), H (Hour), and min (Minute). For
                 example, 1D indicates every day and 15min indicates every  15
                 minutes.  The  value of a frequency must not overlap with the
                 next larger frequency. For example, you must use a  frequency
                 of 1H instead of 60min .

                 The valid values for each frequency are the following:

                 o Minute - 1-59

                 o Hour - 1-23

                 o Day - 1-6

                 o Week - 1-4

                 o Month - 1-11

                 o Year - 1

              ForecastHorizon -> (integer)
                 The  number  of time-steps that the model predicts. The fore-
                 cast horizon is also called the prediction length. The  maxi-
                 mum  forecast  horizon is the lesser of 500 time-steps or 1/4
                 of the time-steps in the dataset.

              ForecastQuantiles -> (list)
                 The quantiles used to train the  model  for  forecasts  at  a
                 specified  quantile. You can specify quantiles from 0.01 (p1)
                 to 0.99 (p99), by increments of 0.01 or higher.  Up  to  five
                 forecast  quantiles  can be specified. When ForecastQuantiles
                 is not provided, the AutoML job uses the quantiles p10,  p50,
                 and p90 as default.

                 (string)

              Transformations -> (structure)
                 The  transformations  modifying  specific  attributes  of the
                 time-series, such as filling strategies for missing values.

                 Filling -> (map)
                     A key value pair defining the filling method for  a  col-
                     umn, where the key is the column name and the value is an
                     object which defines the filling logic. You  can  specify
                     multiple filling methods for a single column.

                     The supported filling methods and their corresponding op-
                     tions are:

                     o frontfill : none (Supported only for target column)

                     o middlefill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     o backfill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     o futurefill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     To set a filling method to a specific value, set the fill
                     parameter to the chosen filling method value (for example
                     "backfill" : "value" ), and define the filling  value  in
                     an additional parameter prefixed with "_value". For exam-
                     ple, to set backfill to a value of 2 , you  must  include
                     two    parameters:   "backfill":   "value"   and   "back-
                     fill_value":"2" .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (map)
                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                 Aggregation -> (map)
                     A key value pair defining the aggregation  method  for  a
                     column, where the key is the column name and the value is
                     the aggregation method.

                     The supported aggregation methods are sum (default),  avg
                     , first , min , max .

                     NOTE:
                        Aggregation is only supported for the target column.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

              TimeSeriesConfig -> (structure)
                 The collection of components that defines the time-series.

                 TargetAttributeName -> (string)
                     The  name  of the column representing the target variable
                     that you want to predict for each item in  your  dataset.
                     The data type of the target variable must be numerical.

                 TimestampAttributeName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  column  indicating a point in time at
                     which the target value of a given item is recorded.

                 ItemIdentifierAttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of the column that represents the  set  of  item
                     identifiers  for  which  you  want  to predict the target
                     value.

                 GroupingAttributeNames -> (list)
                     A set of columns names that can be grouped with the  item
                     identifier  column  to create a composite key for which a
                     target value is predicted.

       --auto-ml-job-objective (structure)
          Specifies  a  metric  to  minimize or maximize as the objective of a
          job. If not specified, the default objective metric depends  on  the
          problem  type.  For the list of default values per problem type, see
          AutoMLJobObjective .

          NOTE:
              For tabular problem types, you must either provide both the  Au-
              toMLJobObjective  and  indicate  the type of supervised learning
              problem in AutoMLProblemTypeConfig (TabularJobConfig.ProblemType
              ), or none at all.

          MetricName -> (string)
              The  name of the objective metric used to measure the predictive
              quality of a  machine  learning  system.  During  training,  the
              model's  parameters are updated iteratively to optimize its per-
              formance based on the feedback provided by the objective  metric
              when evaluating the model on the validation dataset.

              For  the  list  of all available metrics supported by Autopilot,
              see Autopilot metrics .

              If you do not specify a metric explicitly, the default  behavior
              is to automatically use:

              o For tabular problem types:

                o Regression: MSE .

                o Binary classification: F1 .

                o Multiclass classification: Accuracy .

              o For image or text classification problem types: Accuracy

              o For  time-series  forecasting  problem  types:  AverageWeight-
                edQuantileLoss

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MetricName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MetricName": "Accuracy"|"MSE"|"F1"|"F1macro"|"AUC"|"RMSE"|"MAE"|"R2"|"BalancedAccuracy"|"Precision"|"PrecisionMacro"|"Recall"|"RecallMacro"|"MAPE"|"MASE"|"WAPE"|"AverageWeightedQuantileLoss"
          }

       --model-deploy-config (structure)
          Specifies how  to  generate  the  endpoint  name  for  an  automatic
          one-click Autopilot model deployment.

          AutoGenerateEndpointName -> (boolean)
              Set  to  True  to  automatically generate an endpoint name for a
              one-click Autopilot model deployment; set  to  False  otherwise.
              The default value is False .

              NOTE:
                 If  you set AutoGenerateEndpointName to True , do not specify
                 the EndpointName ; otherwise a 400 error is thrown.

          EndpointName -> (string)
              Specifies the endpoint name to use  for  a  one-click  Autopilot
              model deployment if the endpoint name is not generated automati-
              cally.

              NOTE:
                 Specify the EndpointName if and only if you  set  AutoGenera-
                 teEndpointName to False ; otherwise a 400 error is thrown.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AutoGenerateEndpointName=boolean,EndpointName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AutoGenerateEndpointName": true|false,
            "EndpointName": "string"
          }

       --data-split-config (structure)
          This  structure specifies how to split the data into train and vali-
          dation datasets.

          The validation and training datasets must contain the same  headers.
          For jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJob , the validation dataset
          must be less than 2 GB in size.

          NOTE:
              This attribute must not be set for the  time-series  forecasting
              problem  type,  as  Autopilot  automatically  splits  the  input
              dataset into training and validation sets.

          ValidationFraction -> (float)
              The validation fraction (optional) is a float that specifies the
              portion  of  the training dataset to be used for validation. The
              default value is 0.2, and values must be greater than 0 and less
              than 1. We recommend setting this value to be less than 0.5.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ValidationFraction=float

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ValidationFraction": float
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
