SEARCH()                                                              SEARCH()



NAME
       search -

DESCRIPTION
       Finds SageMaker resources that match a search query. Matching resources
       are returned as a list of SearchRecord objects in the response. You can
       sort  the search results by any resource property in a ascending or de-
       scending order.

       You can query against the following value types: numeric,  text,  Bool-
       ean, and timestamp.

       NOTE:
          The  Search API may provide access to otherwise restricted data. See
          Amazon SageMaker API  Permissions:  Actions,  Permissions,  and  Re-
          sources Reference for more information.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       search  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Results

       --search-expression (structure)
          A Boolean conditional statement. Resources must satisfy this  condi-
          tion to be included in search results. You must provide at least one
          subexpression, filter, or nested filter. The maximum number  of  re-
          cursive SubExpressions , NestedFilters , and Filters that can be in-
          cluded in a SearchExpression object is 50.

          Filters -> (list)
              A list of filter objects.

              (structure)
                 A conditional statement for a search expression that includes
                 a  resource  property,  a  Boolean operator, and a value. Re-
                 sources that match the statement are returned in the  results
                 from the Search API.

                 If you specify a Value , but not an Operator , SageMaker uses
                 the equals operator.

                 In search, there are several property types:
                     Metrics

                 To define a metric filter, enter a value using the form "Met-
                 rics.<name>"  ,  where  <name> is a metric name. For example,
                 the following filter searches for training jobs with an  "ac-
                 curacy" metric greater than "0.9" :
                     {

                     "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                     "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                     "Value": "0.9"

                     }
                        HyperParameters

                 To  define  a  hyperparameter  filter, enter a value with the
                 form "HyperParameters.<name>" . Decimal hyperparameter values
                 are  treated  as  a  decimal in a comparison if the specified
                 Value is also a decimal value. If the specified Value  is  an
                 integer, the decimal hyperparameter values are treated as in-
                 tegers. For example, the following  filter  is  satisfied  by
                 training  jobs  with a "learning_rate" hyperparameter that is
                 less than "0.5" :
                     {

                     "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                     "Operator": "LessThan",

                     "Value": "0.5"

                     }
                        Tags

                 To  define  a  tag  filter,  enter  a  value  with  the  form
                 Tags.<key> .

                 Name -> (string)
                     A  resource property name. For example, TrainingJobName .
                     For valid property names, see  SearchRecord  .  You  must
                     specify a valid property for the resource.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     A  Boolean  binary  operator that is used to evaluate the
                     filter. The operator field contains one of the  following
                     values:
                        Equals

                     The value of Name equals Value .
                        NotEquals

                     The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                        Exists

                     The Name property exists.
                        NotExists

                     The Name property does not exist.
                        GreaterThan

                     The  value  of Name is greater than Value . Not supported
                     for text properties.
                        GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                     The value of Name is greater than or equal to Value . Not
                     supported for text properties.
                        LessThan

                     The  value of Name is less than Value . Not supported for
                     text properties.
                        LessThanOrEqualTo

                     The value of Name is less than or equal to  Value  .  Not
                     supported for text properties.
                        In

                     The  value  of Name is one of the comma delimited strings
                     in Value . Only supported for text properties.
                        Contains

                     The value of Name contains the string Value .  Only  sup-
                     ported for text properties.

                     A SearchExpression can include the Contains operator mul-
                     tiple times when the value of Name is one of the  follow-
                     ing:

                     o Experiment.DisplayName

                     o Experiment.ExperimentName

                     o Experiment.Tags

                     o Trial.DisplayName

                     o Trial.TrialName

                     o Trial.Tags

                     o TrialComponent.DisplayName

                     o TrialComponent.TrialComponentName

                     o TrialComponent.Tags

                     o TrialComponent.InputArtifacts

                     o TrialComponent.OutputArtifacts

                     A SearchExpression can include only one Contains operator
                     for all other values of Name . In these cases, if you in-
                     clude multiple Contains operators in the SearchExpression
                     , the result is the following error message:  "'CONTAINS'
                     operator usage limit of 1 exceeded. "

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value  used  with Name and Operator to determine which
                     resources satisfy the filter's condition.  For  numerical
                     properties,  Value  must  be an integer or floating-point
                     decimal. For timestamp properties, Value must be  an  ISO
                     8601   date-time   string   of   the   following  format:
                     YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS .

          NestedFilters -> (list)
              A list of nested filter objects.

              (structure)
                 A list of nested Filter objects. A resource must satisfy  the
                 conditions  of  all filters to be included in the results re-
                 turned from the Search API.

                 For example, to filter on a  training  job's  InputDataConfig
                 property  with  a specific channel name and S3Uri prefix, de-
                 fine the following filters:

                 o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.ChannelName",  "Operator":"Equals",
                   "Value":"train"}',

                 o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri",
                   "Operator":"Contains", "Value":"mybucket/catdata"}'

                 NestedPropertyName -> (string)
                     The name of the property to use in  the  nested  filters.
                     The  value must match a listed property name, such as In-
                     putDataConfig .

                 Filters -> (list)
                     A list of filters. Each filter acts on a  property.  Fil-
                     ters  must  contain at least one Filters value. For exam-
                     ple, a NestedFilters call might include a filter  on  the
                     PropertyName  parameter  of the InputDataConfig property:
                     InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri .

                     (structure)
                        A conditional statement for a search  expression  that
                        includes  a resource property, a Boolean operator, and
                        a value. Resources that match the  statement  are  re-
                        turned in the results from the Search API.

                        If  you  specify a Value , but not an Operator , Sage-
                        Maker uses the equals operator.

                        In search, there are several property types:
                            Metrics

                        To define a metric filter, enter  a  value  using  the
                        form "Metrics.<name>" , where <name> is a metric name.
                        For example, the following filter searches for  train-
                        ing  jobs with an "accuracy" metric greater than "0.9"
                        :
                            {

                            "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                            "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                            "Value": "0.9"

                            }
                               HyperParameters

                        To define a hyperparameter filter, enter a value  with
                        the  form  "HyperParameters.<name>" . Decimal hyperpa-
                        rameter values are treated as a decimal in a  compari-
                        son if the specified Value is also a decimal value. If
                        the specified Value is an integer, the decimal  hyper-
                        parameter values are treated as integers. For example,
                        the following filter is  satisfied  by  training  jobs
                        with  a  "learning_rate"  hyperparameter  that is less
                        than "0.5" :
                            {

                            "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                            "Operator": "LessThan",

                            "Value": "0.5"

                            }
                               Tags

                        To define a tag filter, enter a value  with  the  form
                        Tags.<key> .

                        Name -> (string)
                            A  resource  property  name.  For  example, Train-
                            ingJobName  .  For  valid  property   names,   see
                            SearchRecord  .  You must specify a valid property
                            for the resource.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            A Boolean binary operator that is used to evaluate
                            the filter. The operator field contains one of the
                            following values:
                               Equals

                            The value of Name equals Value .
                               NotEquals

                            The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                               Exists

                            The Name property exists.
                               NotExists

                            The Name property does not exist.
                               GreaterThan

                            The value of Name is greater than Value . Not sup-
                            ported for text properties.
                               GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                            The  value  of  Name  is  greater than or equal to
                            Value . Not supported for text properties.
                               LessThan

                            The value of Name is less than Value  .  Not  sup-
                            ported for text properties.
                               LessThanOrEqualTo

                            The value of Name is less than or equal to Value .
                            Not supported for text properties.
                               In

                            The value of Name is one of  the  comma  delimited
                            strings in Value . Only supported for text proper-
                            ties.
                               Contains

                            The value of Name contains the string Value . Only
                            supported for text properties.

                            A SearchExpression can include the Contains opera-
                            tor multiple times when the value of Name  is  one
                            of the following:

                            o Experiment.DisplayName

                            o Experiment.ExperimentName

                            o Experiment.Tags

                            o Trial.DisplayName

                            o Trial.TrialName

                            o Trial.Tags

                            o TrialComponent.OutputArtifacts

                            A  SearchExpression  can include only one Contains
                            operator for all other values of Name .  In  these
                            cases,  if you include multiple Contains operators
                            in the SearchExpression , the result is  the  fol-

                        Value -> (string)
                            A value used with Name and Operator  to  determine
                            which  resources  satisfy  the filter's condition.
                            For numerical properties, Value must be an integer
                            or  floating-point  decimal. For timestamp proper-
                            ties, Value must be an ISO 8601  date-time  string
                            of the following format: YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS .

          SubExpressions -> (list)
              A list of search expression objects.

              (structure)
                 A  multi-expression  that searches for the specified resource
                 or resources in a search. All resource objects  that  satisfy
                 the  expression's  condition  are  included in the search re-
                 sults. You must specify at least one  subexpression,  filter,
                 or nested filter. A SearchExpression can contain up to twenty
                 elements.

                 A SearchExpression contains the following components:

                 o A list of Filter objects.  Each  filter  defines  a  simple
                   Boolean  expression  comprised of a resource property name,
                   Boolean operator, and value.

                 o A list of NestedFilter objects. Each nested filter  defines
                   a  list  of  Boolean  expressions  using a list of resource
                   properties. A nested filter is satisfied if a single object
                   in the list satisfies all Boolean expressions.

                 o A list of SearchExpression objects. A search expression ob-
                   ject can be nested in a list of search expression objects.

                 o A Boolean operator: And or Or .

                 Filters -> (list)
                     A list of filter objects.

                     (structure)
                        A conditional statement for a search  expression  that
                        includes  a resource property, a Boolean operator, and
                        a value. Resources that match the  statement  are  re-
                        turned in the results from the Search API.

                        If  you  specify a Value , but not an Operator , Sage-
                        Maker uses the equals operator.

                        In search, there are several property types:
                            Metrics

                        To define a metric filter, enter  a  value  using  the
                        form "Metrics.<name>" , where <name> is a metric name.
                        For example, the following filter searches for  train-
                        ing  jobs with an "accuracy" metric greater than "0.9"
                        :
                            {

                            "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                            "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                            "Value": "0.9"

                            }
                               HyperParameters

                        To define a hyperparameter filter, enter a value  with
                        the  form  "HyperParameters.<name>" . Decimal hyperpa-
                        rameter values are treated as a decimal in a  compari-
                        son if the specified Value is also a decimal value. If
                        the specified Value is an integer, the decimal  hyper-
                        parameter values are treated as integers. For example,
                        the following filter is  satisfied  by  training  jobs
                        with  a  "learning_rate"  hyperparameter  that is less
                        than "0.5" :
                            {

                            "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                            "Operator": "LessThan",

                            "Value": "0.5"

                            }
                               Tags

                        To define a tag filter, enter a value  with  the  form
                        Tags.<key> .

                        Name -> (string)
                            A  resource  property  name.  For  example, Train-
                            ingJobName  .  For  valid  property   names,   see
                            SearchRecord  .  You must specify a valid property
                            for the resource.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            A Boolean binary operator that is used to evaluate
                            the filter. The operator field contains one of the
                            following values:
                               Equals

                            The value of Name equals Value .
                               NotEquals

                            The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                               Exists

                            The Name property exists.
                               NotExists

                            The Name property does not exist.
                               GreaterThan

                            The value of Name is greater than Value . Not sup-
                            ported for text properties.
                               GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                            The  value  of  Name  is  greater than or equal to
                            Value . Not supported for text properties.
                               LessThan

                            The value of Name is less than Value  .  Not  sup-
                            ported for text properties.
                               LessThanOrEqualTo

                            The value of Name is less than or equal to Value .
                            Not supported for text properties.
                               In

                            The value of Name is one of  the  comma  delimited
                            strings in Value . Only supported for text proper-
                            ties.
                               Contains

                            The value of Name contains the string Value . Only
                            supported for text properties.

                            A SearchExpression can include the Contains opera-
                            tor multiple times when the value of Name  is  one
                            of the following:

                            o Experiment.DisplayName

                            o Experiment.ExperimentName

                            o Experiment.Tags

                            o Trial.DisplayName

                            o Trial.TrialName

                            o Trial.Tags

                            o TrialComponent.DisplayName

                            o TrialComponent.TrialComponentName

                            o TrialComponent.Tags

                            o TrialComponent.InputArtifacts

                            o TrialComponent.OutputArtifacts

                            A  SearchExpression  can include only one Contains
                            operator for all other values of Name .  In  these
                            cases,  if you include multiple Contains operators
                            in the SearchExpression , the result is  the  fol-
                            lowing  error  message: "'CONTAINS' operator usage
                            limit of 1 exceeded. "

                        Value -> (string)
                            A value used with Name and Operator  to  determine
                            which  resources  satisfy  the filter's condition.
                            For numerical properties, Value must be an integer
                            or  floating-point  decimal. For timestamp proper-
                            ties, Value must be an ISO 8601  date-time  string
                            of the following format: YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS .

                 NestedFilters -> (list)
                     A list of nested filter objects.

                     (structure)
                        A  list of nested Filter objects. A resource must sat-
                        isfy the conditions of all filters to be  included  in
                        the results returned from the Search API.

                        For  example, to filter on a training job's InputData-
                        Config property with a specific channel name and S3Uri
                        prefix, define the following filters:

                        o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.ChannelName",        "Opera-
                          tor":"Equals", "Value":"train"}',

                        o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3Data-
                          Source.S3Uri",  "Operator":"Contains",  "Value":"my-
                          bucket/catdata"}'

                        NestedPropertyName -> (string)
                            The name of the property to use in the nested fil-
                            ters. The value must match a listed property name,
                            such as InputDataConfig .

                        Filters -> (list)
                            A list of filters. Each filter acts on a property.
                            Filters  must  contain at least one Filters value.
                            For example, a NestedFilters call might include  a
                            filter on the PropertyName parameter of the Input-
                            DataConfig     property:     InputDataConfig.Data-
                            Source.S3DataSource.S3Uri .

                            (structure)
                               A conditional statement for a search expression
                               that includes a resource  property,  a  Boolean
                               operator, and a value. Resources that match the
                               statement are returned in the results from  the
                               Search API.

                               If  you specify a Value , but not an Operator ,
                               SageMaker uses the equals operator.

                               In search, there are several property types:
                                   Metrics

                               To define a metric filter, enter a value  using
                               the  form  "Metrics.<name>" , where <name> is a
                               metric name. For example, the following  filter
                               searches  for  training jobs with an "accuracy"
                               metric greater than "0.9" :
                                   {

                                   "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                                   "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                                   "Value": "0.9"

                                   }
                                      HyperParameters

                               To define  a  hyperparameter  filter,  enter  a
                               value  with the form "HyperParameters.<name>" .
                               Decimal hyperparameter values are treated as  a
                               decimal  in a comparison if the specified Value
                               is also a decimal value. If the specified Value
                               is  an integer, the decimal hyperparameter val-
                               ues are treated as integers. For  example,  the
                               following  filter is satisfied by training jobs
                               with a "learning_rate" hyperparameter  that  is
                               less than "0.5" :
                                   {

                                   "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                                   "Operator": "LessThan",

                                   "Value": "0.5"

                                   }
                                      Tags

                               To  define a tag filter, enter a value with the
                               form Tags.<key> .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   A  resource  property  name.  For  example,
                                   TrainingJobName . For valid property names,
                                   see SearchRecord . You must specify a valid
                                   property for the resource.

                               Operator -> (string)
                                   A  Boolean  binary operator that is used to
                                   evaluate the  filter.  The  operator  field
                                   contains one of the following values:
                                      Equals

                                   The value of Name equals Value .
                                      NotEquals

                                   The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                                      Exists

                                   The Name property exists.
                                      NotExists

                                   The Name property does not exist.
                                      GreaterThan

                                   The  value  of Name is greater than Value .
                                   Not supported for text properties.
                                      GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                                   The value of Name is greater than or  equal

       --sort-by (string)
          The  name  of the resource property used to sort the SearchResults .
          The default is LastModifiedTime .

       --sort-order (string)
          How SearchResults are ordered. Valid values  are  Ascending  or  De-
          scending . The default is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cross-account-filter-option (string)
          A  cross account filter option. When the value is "CrossAccount" the
          search results will only include resources made discoverable to  you
          from  other  accounts.  When  the value is "SameAccount" or null the
          search results will only include resources from  your  account.  De-
          fault is null . For more information on searching for resources made
          discoverable to your account, see Search discoverable  resources  in
          the SageMaker Developer Guide. The maximum number of ResourceCatalog
          s viewable is 1000.

          Possible values:

          o SameAccount

          o CrossAccount

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

                        gest]  image  path formats. For more information about
                        using your custom training container, see  Using  Your
                        Own Algorithms with Amazon SageMaker .

                        NOTE:
                            You  must specify either the algorithm name to the
                            AlgorithmName parameter or the image  URI  of  the
                            algorithm  container  to the TrainingImage parame-
                            ter.

                            For more information, see the note  in  the  Algo-
                            rithmName parameter description.

                     AlgorithmName -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  algorithm  resource to use for the
                        training job. This must be an algorithm resource  that
                        you  created  or  subscribe  to on Amazon Web Services
                        Marketplace.

                        NOTE:
                            You must specify either the algorithm name to  the
                            AlgorithmName  parameter  or  the image URI of the
                            algorithm container to the  TrainingImage  parame-
                            ter.

                            Note  that the AlgorithmName parameter is mutually
                            exclusive with the TrainingImage parameter. If you
                            specify  a  value for the AlgorithmName parameter,
                            you can't specify a value for TrainingImage ,  and
                            vice versa.

                            If  you  specify  values  for both parameters, the
                            training job might break; if you don't specify any
                            value  for both parameters, the training job might
                            raise a null error.

                     TrainingInputMode -> (string)
                        The training input mode that the  algorithm  supports.
                        For more information about input modes, see Algorithms
                        .
                            Pipe mode

                        If an algorithm supports Pipe mode,  Amazon  SageMaker
                        streams data directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
                            File mode

                        If  an  algorithm  supports File mode, SageMaker down-
                        loads the training data from S3 to the provisioned  ML
                        storage volume, and mounts the directory to the Docker
                        volume for the training container.

                        You must provision the ML storage volume  with  suffi-
                        cient capacity to accommodate the data downloaded from
                        S3. In addition to the training data, the  ML  storage
                        volume  also  stores  the  output model. The algorithm
                        container uses the ML storage volume to also store in-
                        termediate information, if any.

                        For  distributed algorithms, training data is distrib-
                        uted uniformly. Your training duration is  predictable
                        if  the input data objects sizes are approximately the
                        same. SageMaker does not split the files  any  further
                        for  model  training.  If the object sizes are skewed,
                        training won't be optimal as the data distribution  is
                        also  skewed  when  one  host in a training cluster is
                        overloaded, thus becoming a bottleneck in training.
                            FastFile mode

                        If an  algorithm  supports  FastFile  mode,  SageMaker
                        streams data directly from S3 to the container with no
                        code changes, and provides file system access  to  the
                        data. Users can author their training script to inter-
                        act with these files as if they were stored on disk.
                            FastFile mode works best when the data is read se-
                            quentially.  Augmented  manifest files aren't sup-
                            ported. The startup time is lower when  there  are
                            fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

                     MetricDefinitions -> (list)
                        A list of metric definition objects. Each object spec-
                        ifies the metric name and regular expressions used  to
                        parse  algorithm logs. SageMaker publishes each metric
                        to Amazon CloudWatch.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies a metric  that  the  training  algorithm
                            writes  to  stderr  or stdout . You can view these
                            logs to understand how your training job  performs
                            and check for any errors encountered during train-
                            ing. SageMaker hyperparameter tuning captures  all
                            defined  metrics.  Specify one of the defined met-
                            rics to use  as  an  objective  metric  using  the
                            TuningObjective  parameter  in the HyperParameter-
                            TrainingJobDefinition API to evaluate job  perfor-
                            mance during hyperparameter tuning.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the metric.

                            Regex -> (string)
                               A  regular  expression that searches the output
                               of a training job and gets  the  value  of  the
                               metric.  For more information about using regu-
                               lar expressions to define metrics, see Defining
                               metrics and environment variables .

                     EnableSageMakerMetricsTimeSeries -> (boolean)
                        To generate and save time-series metrics during train-
                        ing, set to true . The default is false  and  time-se-
                        ries  metrics aren't generated except in the following
                        cases:

                        o You use one of the SageMaker built-in algorithms

                        o You use one  of  the  following  Prebuilt  SageMaker
                          Docker Images :

                          o Tensorflow (version >= 1.15)

                          o MXNet (version >= 1.6)

                          o PyTorch (version >= 1.3)

                        o You specify at least one MetricDefinition

                     ContainerEntrypoint -> (list)
                        The  entrypoint  script for a Docker container used to
                        run a training job. This script takes precedence  over
                        the  default  train  processing  instructions. See How
                        Amazon SageMaker Runs Your Training Image for more in-
                        formation.

                     ContainerArguments -> (list)
                        The  arguments  for a container used to run a training
                        job. See How Amazon SageMaker Runs Your Training Image
                        for additional information.

                        (string)

                     TrainingImageConfig -> (structure)
                        The  configuration  to  use  an  image  from a private
                        Docker registry for a training job.

                        TrainingRepositoryAccessMode -> (string)
                            The method that your training job will use to gain
                            access  to  the images in your private Docker reg-
                            istry. For access to an image in a private  Docker
                            registry, set to Vpc .

                        TrainingRepositoryAuthConfig -> (structure)
                            An  object  containing  authentication information
                            for a  private  Docker  registry  containing  your
                            training images.

                            TrainingRepositoryCredentialsProviderArn        ->
                            (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Web
                               Services Lambda function used to give SageMaker
                               access credentials to your private Docker  reg-
                               istry.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Web  Services Identity and Access Management
                     (IAM) role configured for the training job.

                 InputDataConfig -> (list)
                     An array of Channel objects that describes each data  in-
                     put channel.

                     Your input must be in the same Amazon Web Services region
                     as your training job.

                     (structure)
                        A channel is a named input source that training  algo-
                        rithms can consume.

                        ChannelName -> (string)
                            The name of the channel.

                        DataSource -> (structure)
                            The location of the channel data.

                            S3DataSource -> (structure)
                               The  S3 location of the data source that is as-
                               sociated with a channel.

                               S3DataType -> (string)
                                   If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                                   key name prefix. SageMaker uses all objects
                                   that match the specified  key  name  prefix
                                   for model training.

                                   If  you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri identi-
                                   fies an object that is a manifest file con-
                                   taining a list of object keys that you want
                                   SageMaker to use for model training.

                                   If you choose AugmentedManifestFile , S3Uri
                                   identifies  an  object that is an augmented
                                   manifest file in JSON  lines  format.  This
                                   file  contains the data you want to use for
                                   model training.  AugmentedManifestFile  can
                                   only be used if the Channel's input mode is
                                   Pipe .

                               S3Uri -> (string)
                                   Depending on the value  specified  for  the
                                   S3DataType  ,  identifies either a key name
                                   prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                   o A key name prefix might look  like  this:
                                     s3://bucketname/exampleprefix

                                   o A   manifest   might   look   like  this:
                                     s3://bucketname/example.manifest   A man-
                                     ifest  is  an  S3  object which is a JSON
                                     file consisting of an array of  elements.
                                     The  first  element  is a prefix which is
                                     followed by one or more  suffixes.  Sage-
                                     Maker  appends the suffix elements to the
                                     prefix to get a full set of S3Uri .  Note
                                     that the prefix must be a valid non-empty
                                     S3Uri that precludes users from  specify-
                                     ing  a manifest whose individual S3Uri is
                                     sourced from different  S3  buckets.  The
                                     following code example shows a valid man-
                                     ifest format:   [  {"prefix":  "s3://cus-

                                     source. The object that each S3Uri points
                                     to  must be readable by the IAM role that
                                     SageMaker uses to perform tasks  on  your
                                     behalf.

                                   Your  input  bucket must be located in same
                                   Amazon Web Services region as your training

                                   tire dataset on each  ML  compute  instance
                                   that  is launched for model training, spec-
                                   ify FullyReplicated .

                                   If you want SageMaker to replicate a subset
                                   of data on each ML compute instance that is
                                   launched for model training, specify Shard-
                                   edByS3Key  .  If there are n ML compute in-
                                   stances launched for a training  job,  each
                                   instance gets approximately 1/n of the num-
                                   ber of S3  objects.  In  this  case,  model
                                   training on each machine uses only the sub-
                                   set of training data.

                                   Don't choose more ML compute instances  for
                                   training  than available S3 objects. If you
                                   do, some nodes won't get any data  and  you
                                   will  pay for nodes that aren't getting any
                                   training data. This applies  in  both  File
                                   and  Pipe modes. Keep this in mind when de-
                                   veloping algorithms.

                                   In distributed training, where you use mul-
                                   tiple  ML  compute EC2 instances, you might
                                   choose ShardedByS3Key .  If  the  algorithm
                                   requires  copying  training  data to the ML
                                   storage volume (when  TrainingInputMode  is
                                   set  to File ), this copies 1/n of the num-
                                   ber of objects.

                               AttributeNames -> (list)
                                   A list of one or more  attribute  names  to
                                   use that are found in a specified augmented
                                   manifest file.

                                   (string)

                               InstanceGroupNames -> (list)
                                   A list of names of instance groups that get
                                   data from the S3 data source.

                                   (string)

                            FileSystemDataSource -> (structure)
                               The file system that is associated with a chan-
                               nel.

                               FileSystemId -> (string)
                                   The file system id.

                               FileSystemAccessMode -> (string)
                                   The access mode of the mount of the  direc-
                                   tory  associated with the channel. A direc-
                                   tory  can   be   mounted   either   in   ro
                                   (read-only) or rw (read-write) mode.

                               FileSystemType -> (string)
                                   The file system type.

                               DirectoryPath -> (string)
                                   The full path to the directory to associate
                                   with the channel.

                        ContentType -> (string)
                            The MIME type of the data.

                        CompressionType -> (string)
                            If training data is  compressed,  the  compression
                            type.  The default value is None . CompressionType
                            is used only in Pipe input  mode.  In  File  mode,
                            leave this field unset or set it to None.

                        RecordWrapperType -> (string)
                            Specify  RecordIO  as the value when input data is
                            in raw format but the training algorithm  requires
                            the RecordIO format. In this case, SageMaker wraps
                            each individual S3 object in a RecordIO record. If
                            the  input data is already in RecordIO format, you
                            don't need to set this attribute. For more  infor-
                            mation, see Create a Dataset Using RecordIO .

                            In  File mode, leave this field unset or set it to
                            None.

                        InputMode -> (string)
                            (Optional) The input mode  to  use  for  the  data
                            channel  in  a  training  job.  If you don't set a
                            value for InputMode , SageMaker uses the value set
                            for  TrainingInputMode  .  Use  this  parameter to
                            override  the  TrainingInputMode  setting   in   a
                            AlgorithmSpecification  request  when  you  have a
                            channel that needs a different input mode from the
                            training  job's  general  setting. To download the
                            data from Amazon Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon
                            S3)  to  the  provisioned  ML  storage volume, and
                            mount the directory to a Docker volume,  use  File
                            input mode. To stream data directly from Amazon S3
                            to the container, choose Pipe input mode.

                            To use a model for  incremental  training,  choose
                            File input model.

                        ShuffleConfig -> (structure)
                            A  configuration  for  a  shuffle option for input
                            data  in  a  channel.  If  you  use  S3Prefix  for
                            S3DataType  ,  this shuffles the results of the S3
                            key prefix matches. If you use ManifestFile ,  the
                            order of the S3 object references in the Manifest-
                            File is shuffled. If you use AugmentedManifestFile
                            , the order of the JSON lines in the AugmentedMan-
                            ifestFile is shuffled. The shuffling order is  de-
                            termined using the Seed value.

                            For  Pipe  input  mode,  shuffling  is done at the
                            start of every epoch. With large datasets this en-
                            sures  that the order of the training data is dif-
                            ferent for each epoch, it helps  reduce  bias  and
                            possible overfitting. In a multi-node training job
                            when ShuffleConfig is combined with  S3DataDistri-
                            butionType  of  ShardedByS3Key , the data is shuf-
                            fled across nodes so that the content  sent  to  a
                            particular  node  on the first epoch might be sent
                            to a different node on the second epoch.

                            Seed -> (long)
                               Determines the shuffling order in ShuffleConfig
                               value.

                 OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                     The  S3  path  where  model artifacts that you configured
                     when creating the job are stored. SageMaker creates  sub-
                     folders for model artifacts.

                     KmsKeyId -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon
                        Web Services KMS) key that SageMaker uses  to  encrypt
                        the   model   artifacts   at   rest  using  Amazon  S3
                        server-side encryption. The KmsKeyId can be any of the
                        following formats:

                        o //              KMS              Key              ID
                          "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                        o //  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a   KMS   Key
                          "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                        o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                        o // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  a  KMS  Key  Alias
                          "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/Exam-
                          pleAlias"

                        If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your  KMS  key,
                        the  SageMaker execution role must include permissions
                        to call kms:Encrypt . If you don't provide a  KMS  key
                        ID,  SageMaker  uses the default KMS key for Amazon S3
                        for your role's account.  SageMaker  uses  server-side
                        encryption  with KMS-managed keys for OutputDataConfig
                        . If you use a bucket policy with an s3:PutObject per-
                        mission  that only allows objects with server-side en-
                        cryption,     set     the     condition     key     of
                        s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption  to  "aws:kms"  .  For
                        more information, see KMS-Managed Encryption  Keys  in
                        the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

                        The  KMS  key  policy must grant permission to the IAM
                        role that you specify in your CreateTrainingJob , Cre-
                        ateTransformJob , or CreateHyperParameterTuningJob re-
                        quests. For more information, see Using  Key  Policies
                        in  Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon Web Services
                        Key Management Service Developer Guide .

                     S3OutputPath -> (string)
                        Identifies the S3 path where  you  want  SageMaker  to
                        store    the    model    artifacts.    For    example,
                        s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                     CompressionType -> (string)
                        The model output compression type. Select None to out-
                        put an uncompressed model, recommended for large model
                        outputs. Defaults to gzip.

                 ResourceConfig -> (structure)
                     Resources, including ML compute instances and ML  storage
                     volumes, that are configured for model training.

                     InstanceType -> (string)
                        The ML compute instance type.

                        NOTE:
                            SageMaker Training on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
                            (EC2) P4de instances is in preview release  start-
                            ing December 9th, 2022.
                               Amazon  EC2  P4de  instances (currently in pre-
                               view) are powered by 8 NVIDIA  A100  GPUs  with
                               80GB  high-performance  HBM2e GPU memory, which
                               accelerate the speed of training ML models that
                               need   to  be  trained  on  large  datasets  of
                               high-resolution data. In this preview  release,
                               Amazon  SageMaker  supports ML training jobs on
                               P4de instances (ml.p4de.24xlarge  )  to  reduce
                               model  training  time. The ml.p4de.24xlarge in-
                               stances are available in the  following  Amazon
                               Web Services Regions.

                            o US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)

                            To  request  quota  limit increase and start using
                            P4de instances,  contact  the  SageMaker  Training
                            service team through your account team.

                     InstanceCount -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  ML compute instances to use. For dis-
                        tributed training, provide a value greater than 1.

                     VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                        The size of the ML storage volume  that  you  want  to
                        provision.

                        ML storage volumes store model artifacts and incremen-
                        tal states. Training algorithms might also use the  ML
                        storage volume for scratch space. If you want to store
                        the training data in the  ML  storage  volume,  choose
                        File  as the TrainingInputMode in the algorithm speci-
                        fication.

                        When using an ML instance  with  NVMe  SSD  volumes  ,
                        SageMaker doesn't provision Amazon EBS General Purpose
                        SSD (gp2) storage. Available storage is fixed  to  the
                        NVMe-type  instance's storage capacity. SageMaker con-
                        figures storage paths for  training  datasets,  check-
                        points, model artifacts, and outputs to use the entire
                        capacity of the instance storage. For example, ML  in-
                        stance  families  with  the NVMe-type instance storage
                        include ml.p4d , ml.g4dn , and ml.g5 .

                        When using an ML instance with  the  EBS-only  storage
                        option  and  without instance storage, you must define
                        the size of EBS volume through VolumeSizeInGB  in  the
                        ResourceConfig  API. For example, ML instance families
                        that use EBS volumes include ml.c5 and ml.p2 .

                        To look up instance types and their  instance  storage
                        types and volumes, see Amazon EC2 Instance Types .

                        To  find  the default local paths defined by the Sage-
                        Maker training platform, see Amazon SageMaker Training

                     VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services KMS key that SageMaker uses to
                        encrypt  data on the storage volume attached to the ML
                        compute instance(s) that run the training job.

                        NOTE:
                            Certain Nitro-based instances include local  stor-
                            age, dependent on the instance type. Local storage
                            volumes are encrypted using a hardware  module  on
                            the  instance.  You can't request a VolumeKmsKeyId
                            when using an instance type with local storage.

                            For a list of instance types  that  support  local
                            instance storage, see Instance Store Volumes .

                            encryption, see SSD Instance Store Volumes .

                        The VolumeKmsKeyId can be in any of the following for-
                        mats:

                        o //              KMS              Key              ID
                          "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                        o //  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a   KMS   Key
                          "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     InstanceGroups -> (list)
                        The configuration of a heterogeneous cluster  in  JSON
                        format.

                        (structure)
                            Defines  an instance group for heterogeneous clus-
                            ter training. When requesting a training job using
                            the  CreateTrainingJob API, you can configure mul-
                            tiple instance groups .

                            InstanceType -> (string)
                               Specifies the instance  type  of  the  instance
                               group.

                            InstanceCount -> (integer)
                               Specifies  the  number  of instances of the in-
                               stance group.

                            InstanceGroupName -> (string)
                               Specifies the name of the instance group.

                     KeepAlivePeriodInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The duration of time in seconds to  retain  configured
                        resources in a warm pool for subsequent training jobs.

                 VpcConfig -> (structure)
                     A  VpcConfig  object  that  specifies  the  VPC that this
                     training job has access to.  For  more  information,  see
                     Protect  Training Jobs by Using an Amazon Virtual Private
                     Cloud .

                     SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                        The VPC security group IDs, in the  form  sg-xxxxxxxx.
                        Specify the security groups for the VPC that is speci-
                        fied in the Subnets field.

                        (string)

                     Subnets -> (list)
                        The ID of the subnets in the VPC to which you want  to
                        connect  your  training  job or model. For information
                        about the availability of specific instance types, see
                        Supported Instance Types and Availability Zones .

                        (string)

                 StoppingCondition -> (structure)
                     Specifies  a  limit  to how long a model training job can
                     run. It also specifies how long a managed  Spot  training
                     job has to complete. When the job reaches the time limit,
                     SageMaker ends the training job.  Use  this  API  to  cap
                     model training costs.

                     To  stop a job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM
                     signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Al-
                     gorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model
                     artifacts, so the results of training are not lost.

                     MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The maximum length of time, in seconds, that a  train-
                        ing or compilation job can run before it is stopped.

                        For  compilation  jobs,  if  the job does not complete
                        during this time, a TimeOut  error  is  generated.  We
                        recommend  starting with 900 seconds and increasing as
                        necessary based on your model.

                        For all other jobs, if the job does not complete  dur-
                        ing  this  time,  SageMaker ends the job. When RetryS-
                        trategy is specified in the job request, MaxRuntimeIn-
                        Seconds  specifies the maximum time for all of the at-
                        tempts in total, not each individual attempt. The  de-
                        fault value is 1 day. The maximum value is 28 days.

                        The  maximum time that a TrainingJob can run in total,
                        including any time spent publishing metrics or archiv-
                        ing and uploading models after it has been stopped, is
                        30 days.

                     MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The maximum length of time, in seconds, that a managed
                        Spot training job has to complete. It is the amount of
                        time spent waiting for Spot capacity plus  the  amount
                        of  time  the  job  can  run.  It  must be equal to or
                        greater than MaxRuntimeInSeconds . If the job does not
                        complete during this time, SageMaker ends the job.

                        When  RetryStrategy  is  specified in the job request,
                        MaxWaitTimeInSeconds specifies the  maximum  time  for
                        all  of the attempts in total, not each individual at-
                        tempt.

                 CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp that indicates when the training job was cre-
                     ated.

                 TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates the time when the training job starts on train-
                     ing instances. You are billed for the time  interval  be-
                     tween  this  time  and the value of TrainingEndTime . The
                     start time in CloudWatch Logs might be  later  than  this
                     time. The difference is due to the time it takes to down-
                     load the training data and to the size  of  the  training
                     container.

                 TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates the time when the training job ends on training
                     instances. You are billed for the time  interval  between
                     the  value  of  TrainingStartTime and this time. For suc-
                     cessful jobs and stopped jobs, this  is  the  time  after
                     model  artifacts  are  uploaded. For failed jobs, this is
                     the time when SageMaker detects a job failure.

                 LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp that indicates when the status of the  train-
                     ing job was last modified.

                 SecondaryStatusTransitions -> (list)
                     A  history  of  all  of  the  secondary statuses that the
                     training job has transitioned through.

                     (structure)
                        An array  element  of  SecondaryStatusTransitions  for
                        DescribeTrainingJob  .  It provides additional details
                        about a status that the training job has  transitioned
                        through.  A  training  job  can  be  in one of several
                        states, for example, starting, downloading,  training,
                        or uploading. Within each state, there are a number of
                        intermediate states. For example, within the  starting
                        state, SageMaker could be starting the training job or
                        launching the ML instances. These transitional  states
                        are referred to as the job's secondary status.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Contains  a  secondary  status  information from a
                            training job.

                            Status might be one  of  the  following  secondary
                            statuses:
                               InProgress

                            o Starting - Starting the training job.

                            o Downloading  -  An optional stage for algorithms
                              that support File training input mode. It  indi-
                              cates  that  data  is being downloaded to the ML
                              storage volumes.

                            o Training - Training is in progress.

                            o Uploading - Training is complete and  the  model
                              artifacts are being uploaded to the S3 location.

                              Completed

                            o Completed - The training job has completed.

                              Failed

                            o Failed - The training job has failed. The reason
                              for the failure is returned in the FailureReason
                              field of DescribeTrainingJobResponse .

                              Stopped

                            o MaxRuntimeExceeded  - The job stopped because it
                              exceeded the maximum allowed runtime.

                            o Stopped - The training job has stopped.

                              Stopping

                            o Stopping - Stopping the training job.

                            We no longer support the following secondary  sta-
                            tuses:

                            o LaunchingMLInstances

                            o PreparingTrainingStack

                            o DownloadingTrainingImage

                        StartTime -> (timestamp)
                            A timestamp that shows when the training job tran-
                            sitioned to the current secondary status state.

                        EndTime -> (timestamp)
                            A timestamp that shows when the training job tran-
                            sitioned  out  of this secondary status state into
                            another secondary status state or when the  train-
                            ing job has ended.

                        StatusMessage -> (string)
                            A  detailed  description  of the progress within a
                            secondary status.

                            SageMaker provides secondary statuses  and  status
                            messages that apply to each of them:
                               Starting

                            o Starting the training job.

                            o Launching requested ML instances.

                            o Insufficient   capacity  error  from  EC2  while
                              launching instances, retrying!

                            o Launched instance was unhealthy, replacing it!

                            o Preparing the instances for training.

                              Training

                            o Downloading the training image.

                            o Training image download completed.  Training  in
                              progress.

                            WARNING:
                               Status  messages  are subject to change. There-
                               fore, we recommend not including them  in  code
                               that  programmatically  initiates  actions. For
                               examples,  don't  use  status  messages  in  if
                               statements.

                 FinalMetricDataList -> (list)
                     A  list  of  final  metric  values  that are set when the
                     training job completes. Used only if the training job was
                     configured to use metrics.

                     (structure)
                        The  name,  value,  and date and time of a metric that
                        was emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.

                        MetricName -> (string)
                            The name of the metric.

                        Value -> (float)
                            The value of the metric.

                        Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                            The date and time that the algorithm  emitted  the
                            metric.

                 EnableNetworkIsolation -> (boolean)
                     If  the  TrainingJob  was created with network isolation,
                     the value is set to true . If network  isolation  is  en-

                                   AlgorithmName  parameter, you can't specify
                                   a value for TrainingImage , and vice versa.

                                   If you specify values for both  parameters,
                                   the  training job might break; if you don't
                                   specify any value for both parameters,  the
                                   training job might raise a null error.

                            TrainingInputMode -> (string)
                               The training input mode that the algorithm sup-
                               ports. For more information about input  modes,
                               see Algorithms .
                                   Pipe mode

                               If  an  algorithm  supports  Pipe  mode, Amazon
                               SageMaker streams data directly from Amazon  S3
                               to the container.
                                   File mode

                               If  an  algorithm supports File mode, SageMaker
                               downloads the training data from S3 to the pro-
                               visioned  ML storage volume, and mounts the di-
                               rectory to the Docker volume for  the  training
                               container.

                               You  must  provision the ML storage volume with
                               sufficient capacity  to  accommodate  the  data
                               downloaded from S3. In addition to the training
                               data, the ML storage  volume  also  stores  the
                               output  model. The algorithm container uses the
                               ML storage volume to  also  store  intermediate
                               information, if any.

                               For  distributed  algorithms,  training data is
                               distributed uniformly. Your  training  duration
                               is  predictable if the input data objects sizes
                               are approximately the same. SageMaker does  not
                               split the files any further for model training.
                               If the object sizes are skewed, training  won't
                               be  optimal  as  the  data distribution is also
                               skewed when one host in a training  cluster  is
                               overloaded,   thus  becoming  a  bottleneck  in
                               training.
                                   FastFile mode

                               If an algorithm supports FastFile  mode,  Sage-
                               Maker streams data directly from S3 to the con-
                               tainer with no code changes, and provides  file
                               system  access  to  the  data. Users can author
                               their training script to  interact  with  these
                               files as if they were stored on disk.
                                   FastFile  mode  works best when the data is
                                   read sequentially. Augmented manifest files
                                   aren't supported. The startup time is lower
                                   when there are fewer files in the S3 bucket
                                   provided.

                            MetricDefinitions -> (list)
                               A  list  of metric definition objects. Each ob-
                               ject specifies the metric name and regular  ex-
                               pressions  used  to parse algorithm logs. Sage-
                               Maker publishes each metric  to  Amazon  Cloud-
                               Watch.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies  a metric that the training algo-
                                   rithm writes to stderr or stdout . You  can
                                   view  these  logs  to  understand  how your
                                   training job performs and check for any er-
                                   rors encountered during training. SageMaker
                                   hyperparameter tuning captures all  defined
                                   metrics. Specify one of the defined metrics
                                   to use as an  objective  metric  using  the
                                   TuningObjective  parameter  in the HyperPa-
                                   rameterTrainingJobDefinition API to  evalu-

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the metric.

                                   Regex -> (string)
                                      A regular expression that  searches  the
                                      output  of  a  training job and gets the
                                      value of the metric. For  more  informa-

                                      environment variables .

                            EnableSageMakerMetricsTimeSeries -> (boolean)
                               To generate and save time-series metrics during
                               training, set to true . The  default  is  false
                               and time-series metrics aren't generated except
                               in the following cases:

                               o You use one of the SageMaker  built-in  algo-

                               used  to  run a training job. This script takes
                               precedence over the  default  train  processing

                               TrainingRepositoryAccessMode -> (string)
                                   The  method that your training job will use
                                   to gain access to the images in  your  pri-
                                   vate  Docker registry. For access to an im-

                        InputDataConfig -> (list)
                            An  array  of  Channel objects that describes each
                            data input channel.

                            Your input must be in the same Amazon Web Services
                            region as your training job.

                            (structure)
                               A channel is a named input source that training
                               algorithms can consume.

                               ChannelName -> (string)
                                   The name of the channel.

                               DataSource -> (structure)
                                   The location of the channel data.

                                   S3DataSource -> (structure)
                                      The S3 location of the data source  that
                                      is associated with a channel.

                                      S3DataType -> (string)
                                          If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri iden-
                                          tifies a key name prefix.  SageMaker
                                          uses  all  objects  that  match  the
                                          specified key name prefix for  model
                                          training.

                                          If  you  choose ManifestFile , S3Uri
                                          identifies an object that is a mani-
                                          fest  file  containing a list of ob-
                                          ject keys that you want SageMaker to
                                          use for model training.

                                          If  you choose AugmentedManifestFile
                                          , S3Uri identifies an object that is
                                          an  augmented  manifest file in JSON
                                          lines format. This file contains the
                                          data  you  want  to  use  for  model
                                          training. AugmentedManifestFile  can
                                          only  be used if the Channel's input
                                          mode is Pipe .

                                      S3Uri -> (string)
                                          Depending on the value specified for
                                          the S3DataType , identifies either a
                                          key name prefix or a  manifest.  For
                                          example:

                                          o A  key name prefix might look like
                                            this:  s3://bucketname/examplepre-
                                            fix

                                          o A  manifest  might look like this:
                                            s3://bucketname/example.manifest
                                            A  manifest  is an S3 object which
                                            is a JSON file  consisting  of  an
                                            array  of elements. The first ele-
                                            ment is a prefix which is followed
                                            by one or more suffixes. SageMaker
                                            appends the suffix elements to the
                                            prefix  to get a full set of S3Uri
                                            . Note that the prefix must  be  a
                                            valid  non-empty  S3Uri  that pre-
                                            cludes  users  from  specifying  a
                                            manifest whose individual S3Uri is
                                            sourced from different S3 buckets.
                                            The following code example shows a

                                          If  there are n ML compute instances
                                          launched for a  training  job,  each
                                          instance  gets  approximately 1/n of
                                          the number of S3  objects.  In  this
                                          case, model training on each machine
                                          uses only  the  subset  of  training
                                          data.

                                          Don't  choose  more  ML  compute in-
                                          stances for training than  available
                                          S3  objects.  If  you do, some nodes
                                          won't get any data and you will  pay
                                          for  nodes  that  aren't getting any
                                          training data. This applies in  both
                                          File  and  Pipe  modes. Keep this in
                                          mind when developing algorithms.

                                   pression type. The default value is None  .
                                   CompressionType  is used only in Pipe input
                                   mode. In File mode, leave this field  unset
                                   or set it to None.

                               RecordWrapperType -> (string)
                                   Specify  RecordIO  as  the value when input
                                   data is in raw format but the training  al-
                                   gorithm  requires  the  RecordIO format. In
                                   this case, SageMaker wraps each  individual
                                   S3  object in a RecordIO record. If the in-
                                   put data is already in RecordIO format, you
                                   don't  need to set this attribute. For more

                               InputMode -> (string)
                                   (Optional) The input mode to  use  for  the
                                   data  channel  in  a  training  job. If you
                                   don't set a value for InputMode , SageMaker
                                   uses  the value set for TrainingInputMode .

                               ShuffleConfig -> (structure)
                                   A configuration for a  shuffle  option  for
                                   input  data in a channel. If you use S3Pre-
                                   fix for S3DataType , this shuffles the  re-
                                   sults  of the S3 key prefix matches. If you
                                   use ManifestFile , the order of the S3  ob-
                                   ject  references  in  the  ManifestFile  is
                                   shuffled. If you use  AugmentedManifestFile
                                   ,  the  order of the JSON lines in the Aug-
                                   mentedManifestFile is shuffled.  The  shuf-
                                   fling  order  is  determined using the Seed
                                   value.

                                   For Pipe input mode, shuffling is  done  at
                                   the   start  of  every  epoch.  With  large
                                   datasets this ensures that the order of the
                                   training  data is different for each epoch,
                                   it helps reduce bias and possible  overfit-
                                   ting.  In  a  multi-node  training job when
                                   ShuffleConfig is combined  with  S3DataDis-
                                   tributionType  of ShardedByS3Key , the data
                                   is shuffled across nodes so that  the  con-
                                   tent sent to a particular node on the first
                                   epoch might be sent to a different node  on
                                   the second epoch.

                                   Seed -> (long)

                        OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                            The S3 path where model artifacts that you config-
                            ured  when  creating the job are stored. SageMaker
                            creates subfolders for model artifacts.

                               If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your KMS
                               key,  the SageMaker execution role must include
                               permissions to call kms:Encrypt . If you  don't
                               provide  a  KMS  key ID, SageMaker uses the de-
                               fault KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's ac-
                               count.  SageMaker  uses  server-side encryption
                               with KMS-managed keys for OutputDataConfig . If
                               you  use  a  bucket policy with an s3:PutObject
                               permission  that  only  allows   objects   with
                               server-side  encryption,  set the condition key
                               of s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms"

                               The KMS key policy must grant permission to the
                               IAM role that you specify in your  CreateTrain-

                            S3OutputPath -> (string)
                               Identifies the S3 path where you want SageMaker
                               to store  the  model  artifacts.  For  example,
                               s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                            CompressionType -> (string)
                               The  model output compression type. Select None
                               to output an  uncompressed  model,  recommended
                               for large model outputs. Defaults to gzip.

                        ResourceConfig -> (structure)
                            Resources,  including  ML compute instances and ML
                            storage volumes, that  are  configured  for  model

                                   view release starting December 9th, 2022.
                                      Amazon  EC2 P4de instances (currently in
                                      preview) are powered by  8  NVIDIA  A100
                                      GPUs  with  80GB  high-performance HBM2e
                                      GPU memory, which accelerate  the  speed
                                      of  training  ML  models that need to be
                                      trained on large datasets of  high-reso-
                                      lution  data.  In  this preview release,
                                      Amazon SageMaker  supports  ML  training
                                      jobs on P4de instances (ml.p4de.24xlarge
                                      ) to reduce  model  training  time.  The
                                      ml.p4de.24xlarge instances are available
                                      in the following Amazon Web Services Re-

                            InstanceCount -> (integer)
                               The number of ML compute instances to use.  For
                               distributed  training,  provide a value greater
                               than 1.

                            VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                               The size of the ML storage volume that you want
                               to provision.

                               ML  storage  volumes  store model artifacts and
                               incremental states. Training  algorithms  might
                               also  use  the  ML  storage  volume for scratch
                               space. If you want to store the  training  data
                               in  the  ML  storage volume, choose File as the
                               TrainingInputMode in the  algorithm  specifica-
                               tion.

                               When using an ML instance with NVMe SSD volumes
                               , SageMaker doesn't provision Amazon  EBS  Gen-
                               eral Purpose SSD (gp2) storage. Available stor-
                               age is fixed to the NVMe-type instance's  stor-
                               age   capacity.  SageMaker  configures  storage
                               paths for training datasets, checkpoints, model
                               artifacts, and outputs to use the entire capac-
                               ity of the instance storage.  For  example,  ML
                               instance  families  with the NVMe-type instance
                               storage include ml.p4d , ml.g4dn , and ml.g5 .

                               When using an ML  instance  with  the  EBS-only
                               storage  option  and  without instance storage,
                               you must define the size of EBS volume  through
                               VolumeSizeInGB  in  the ResourceConfig API. For
                               example, ML instance families that use EBS vol-
                               umes include ml.c5 and ml.p2 .

                            VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The  Amazon Web Services KMS key that SageMaker
                               uses to encrypt data on the storage volume  at-
                               tached  to  the ML compute instance(s) that run
                               the training job.

                               NOTE:
                                   Certain Nitro-based instances include local
                                   storage,  dependent  on  the instance type.
                                   Local storage volumes are encrypted using a
                                   hardware  module on the instance. You can't
                                   request a VolumeKmsKeyId when using an  in-
                                   stance type with local storage.

                                   local instance storage, see Instance  Store
                                   Volumes .

                               The VolumeKmsKeyId can be in any of the follow-
                               ing formats:

                               o //           KMS            Key            ID

                            InstanceGroups -> (list)
                               The configuration of a heterogeneous cluster in
                               JSON format.

                               (structure)
                                   Defines an instance group for heterogeneous
                                   cluster  training. When requesting a train-
                                   ing job using  the  CreateTrainingJob  API,
                                   you  can configure multiple instance groups
                                   .

                                   InstanceType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the instance type of  the  in-
                                      stance group.

                                   InstanceCount -> (integer)
                                      Specifies the number of instances of the
                                      instance group.

                                   InstanceGroupName -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  name  of  the   instance
                                      group.

                            KeepAlivePeriodInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The  duration of time in seconds to retain con-
                               figured resources in a warm pool for subsequent
                               training jobs.

                        VpcConfig -> (structure)
                            A  VpcConfig  object  that  specifies the VPC that
                            this training job has access to. For more informa-

                            SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                               The  VPC  security  group  IDs,  in  the   form
                               sg-xxxxxxxx.  Specify  the  security groups for
                               the VPC that is specified in the Subnets field.

                               (string)

                            Subnets -> (list)
                               The ID of the subnets in the VPC to  which  you
                               want to connect your training job or model. For
                               information about the availability of  specific
                               instance  types,  see  Supported Instance Types
                               and Availability Zones .

                               (string)

                        StoppingCondition -> (structure)
                            Specifies a limit to how long a model training job
                            can run. It also specifies how long a managed Spot
                            training job has to complete. When the job reaches
                            the  time  limit, SageMaker ends the training job.
                            Use this API to cap model training costs.

                            To stop a job, SageMaker sends the  algorithm  the
                            SIGTERM  signal,  which delays job termination for
                            120 seconds. Algorithms can  use  this  120-second
                            window to save the model artifacts, so the results
                            of training are not lost.

                            MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The maximum length of time, in seconds, that  a
                               training  or  compilation job can run before it
                               is stopped.

                               For compilation jobs, if the job does not  com-
                               plete during this time, a TimeOut error is gen-
                               erated. We recommend starting with 900  seconds
                               and  increasing  as  necessary  based  on  your
                               model.

                               For all other jobs, if the job  does  not  com-
                               plete during this time, SageMaker ends the job.
                               When RetryStrategy is specified in the job  re-

                               mum time for all of the attempts in total,  not
                               each individual attempt. The default value is 1
                               day. The maximum value is 28 days.

                               The maximum time that a TrainingJob can run  in
                               total, including any time spent publishing met-
                               rics or archiving and uploading models after it
                               has been stopped, is 30 days.

                            MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The  maximum length of time, in seconds, that a
                               managed Spot training job has to  complete.  It
                               is  the  amount  of time spent waiting for Spot
                               capacity plus the amount of time  the  job  can
                               run.  It  must  be  equal  to  or  greater than
                               MaxRuntimeInSeconds . If the job does not  com-
                               plete during this time, SageMaker ends the job.

                               When  RetryStrategy is specified in the job re-
                               quest, MaxWaitTimeInSeconds specifies the maxi-
                               mum  time for all of the attempts in total, not
                               each individual attempt.

                        CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                            A timestamp that indicates when the  training  job
                            was created.

                        TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates the time when the training job starts on
                            training instances. You are billed  for  the  time
                            interval between this time and the value of Train-
                            ingEndTime . The start  time  in  CloudWatch  Logs
                            might  be  later than this time. The difference is
                            due to the time it takes to download the  training
                            data and to the size of the training container.

                        TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates  the  time when the training job ends on
                            training instances. You are billed  for  the  time
                            interval  between  the  value of TrainingStartTime
                            and this time. For  successful  jobs  and  stopped
                            jobs,  this  is the time after model artifacts are
                            uploaded. For failed jobs, this is the  time  when
                            SageMaker detects a job failure.

                        LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                            A  timestamp that indicates when the status of the
                            training job was last modified.

                        SecondaryStatusTransitions -> (list)
                            A history of all of the  secondary  statuses  that
                            the training job has transitioned through.

                            (structure)
                               An  array element of SecondaryStatusTransitions
                               for DescribeTrainingJob  .  It  provides  addi-
                               tional details about a status that the training
                               job has transitioned through.  A  training  job
                               can  be  in one of several states, for example,
                               starting, downloading, training, or  uploading.
                               Within each state, there are a number of inter-
                               mediate states. For example, within the  start-
                               ing  state,  SageMaker  could  be  starting the
                               training job or  launching  the  ML  instances.
                               These  transitional  states  are referred to as
                               the job's secondary status.

                               Status -> (string)
                                   Contains  a  secondary  status  information
                                   from a training job.

                                   Status  might  be one of the following sec-
                                   ondary statuses:

                                   A timestamp that shows  when  the  training
                                   job  transitioned  to the current secondary
                                   status state.

                               EndTime -> (timestamp)
                                   A timestamp that shows  when  the  training
                                   job transitioned out of this secondary sta-
                                   tus state  into  another  secondary  status
                                   state or when the training job has ended.

                               StatusMessage -> (string)
                                   A  detailed  description  of  the  progress
                                   within a secondary status.

                                   SageMaker provides secondary  statuses  and
                                   status messages that apply to each of them:

                            training job was configured to use metrics.

                            (structure)
                               The name, value, and date and time of a  metric
                               that was emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.

                               MetricName -> (string)
                                   The name of the metric.

                                   The  date and time that the algorithm emit-
                                   ted the metric.

                        EnableNetworkIsolation -> (boolean)
                            If the TrainingJob was created with network isola-
                            tion, the value is set to true . If network isola-
                            tion is enabled, nodes  can't  communicate  beyond
                            the VPC they run in.

                        EnableInterContainerTrafficEncryption -> (boolean)

                            long  it takes depends on the amount of communica-
                            tion between compute instances, especially if  you
                            use  a  deep  learning  algorithm  in  distributed
                            training.

                        EnableManagedSpotTraining -> (boolean)

                                   S3Uri -> (string)
                                      The URI of the Amazon S3  prefix  Amazon
                                      SageMaker downloads data required to run
                                      a processing job.

                                   LocalPath -> (string)
                                      The local path in your  container  where
                                      you want Amazon SageMaker to write input
                                      data to. LocalPath is an  absolute  path
                                      to  the  input  data and must begin with
                                      /opt/ml/processing/ . LocalPath is a re-
                                      quired   parameter  when  AppManaged  is
                                      False (default).

                                   S3DataType -> (string)
                                      Whether you use an S3Prefix or  a  Mani-
                                      festFile  for  the  data  type.  If  you
                                      choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a key
                                      name  prefix.  Amazon SageMaker uses all
                                      objects with the specified key name pre-
                                      fix  for  the  processing  job.  If  you
                                      choose ManifestFile ,  S3Uri  identifies
                                      an  object  that is a manifest file con-
                                      taining a list of object keys  that  you
                                      want  Amazon  SageMaker  to  use for the
                                      processing job.

                                   S3InputMode -> (string)
                                      Whether to use File or Pipe input  mode.
                                      In  File  mode,  Amazon SageMaker copies
                                      the data from the input source onto  the
                                      local  ML storage volume before starting
                                      your processing container. This  is  the
                                      most  commonly  used input mode. In Pipe
                                      mode,  Amazon  SageMaker  streams  input
                                      data  from  the  source directly to your
                                      processing container  into  named  pipes
                                      without using the ML storage volume.

                                   S3DataDistributionType -> (string)
                                      Whether to distribute the data from Ama-

                                      FullyReplicated  ,  or  whether the data
                                      from Amazon S3 is shared  by  Amazon  S3
                                      key,  downloading  one  shard of data to
                                      each processing instance.

                                   S3CompressionType -> (string)
                                      Whether to GZIP-decompress the  data  in

                                      processing container. Gzip can  only  be
                                      used  when Pipe mode is specified as the
                                      S3InputMode . In Pipe mode, Amazon Sage-
                                      Maker streams input data from the source
                                      directly to your container without using
                                      the EBS volume.

                            associated with this processing job.

                        AutoMLJobArn -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the AutoML job
                            associated with this processing job.

                        TrainingJobArn -> (string)
                            The ARN of the training job associated  with  this
                            processing job.

                        Tags -> (list)
                            An array of key-value pairs. For more information,

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The tag key. Tag keys must  be  unique  per
                                   resource.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The tag value.

                     TransformJob -> (structure)
                        Information about a transform job that's the source of
                        a trial component.

                        TransformJobName -> (string)
                            The name of the transform job.

                        TransformJobArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  transform
                            job.

                        TransformJobStatus -> (string)
                            The status of the transform job.

                            Transform job statuses are:

                            o InProgress - The job is in progress.

                            o Completed - The job has completed.

                            o Failed  -  The  transform job has failed. To see
                              the reason for the failure, see the  FailureRea-
                              son field in the response to a DescribeTransfor-
                              mJob call.

                            o Stopping - The transform job is stopping.

                            o Stopped - The transform job has stopped.

                        FailureReason -> (string)
                            If the transform job failed, the reason it failed.

                        ModelName -> (string)
                            The name of the model associated with  the  trans-
                            form job.

                        MaxConcurrentTransforms -> (integer)
                            The  maximum  number of parallel requests that can
                            be sent to each instance in a  transform  job.  If
                            MaxConcurrentTransforms is set to 0 or left unset,
                            SageMaker checks the optional execution-parameters
                            to  determine  the  settings for your chosen algo-
                            rithm. If the execution-parameters endpoint is not
                            enabled,  the default value is 1. For built-in al-
                            gorithms, you don't need to set a value  for  Max-
                            ConcurrentTransforms .

                        ModelClientConfig -> (structure)
                            Configures  the  timeout and maximum number of re-
                            tries for processing a transform job invocation.

                            InvocationsTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The timeout value in seconds for an  invocation
                               request. The default value is 600.

                            InvocationsMaxRetries -> (integer)
                               The  maximum  number of retries when invocation
                               requests are failing. The default value is 3.

                        MaxPayloadInMB -> (integer)
                            The maximum allowed size of the payload, in MB.  A
                            payload  is  the data portion of a record (without
                            metadata). The value  in  MaxPayloadInMB  must  be
                            greater  than,  or  equal to, the size of a single
                            record. To estimate the size of a  record  in  MB,
                            divide  the  size of your dataset by the number of
                            records. To ensure that the records fit within the
                            maximum   payload   size,  we  recommend  using  a
                            slightly larger value. The default value is 6  MB.
                            For  cases  where the payload might be arbitrarily
                            large and is transmitted using HTTP chunked encod-
                            ing,  set  the value to 0. This feature works only
                            in  supported  algorithms.  Currently,   SageMaker
                            built-in  algorithms  do  not support HTTP chunked
                            encoding.

                        BatchStrategy -> (string)
                            Specifies the number of records to  include  in  a
                            mini-batch for an HTTP inference request. A record
                            is a single unit of input data that inference  can
                            be  made  on.  For example, a single line in a CSV
                            file is a record.

                        Environment -> (map)
                            The environment variables to  set  in  the  Docker
                            container.  We support up to 16 key and values en-
                            tries in the map.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (string)

                        TransformInput -> (structure)
                            Describes the input source of a transform job  and
                            the way the transform job consumes it.

                            DataSource -> (structure)
                               Describes  the  location  of  the channel data,
                               which is, the S3 location  of  the  input  data
                               that the model can consume.

                               S3DataSource -> (structure)
                                   The  S3 location of the data source that is
                                   associated with a channel.

                                   S3DataType -> (string)
                                      If you choose S3Prefix ,  S3Uri  identi-
                                      fies a key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker
                                      uses all objects with the specified  key
                                      name prefix for batch transform.

                                      If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri iden-
                                      tifies an object that is a manifest file
                                      containing  a  list  of object keys that
                                      you want Amazon  SageMaker  to  use  for
                                      batch transform.

                                      The  following  values  are  compatible:
                                      ManifestFile , S3Prefix

                                      The following value is  not  compatible:
                                      AugmentedManifestFile

                                   S3Uri -> (string)
                                      Depending on the value specified for the
                                      S3DataType ,  identifies  either  a  key
                                      name prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                      o A  key  name  prefix  might  look like
                                        this: s3://bucketname/exampleprefix .

                                      o A  manifest  might  look  like   this:
                                        s3://bucketname/example.manifest   The
                                        manifest is an S3 object  which  is  a
                                        JSON  file  with the following format:
                                        [        {"prefix":         "s3://cus-

                                        tive/path/custdata-N    The   complete

                                        tutes the input data for  the  channel
                                        for  this  datasource. The object that
                                        each S3Uris points to must be readable
                                        by  the IAM role that Amazon SageMaker
                                        uses to perform tasks on your behalf.

                            ContentType -> (string)
                               The multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME)
                               type  of  the  data.  Amazon SageMaker uses the
                               MIME type with each http call to transfer  data
                               to the transform job.

                            CompressionType -> (string)
                               If  your  transform data is compressed, specify
                               the compression type. Amazon SageMaker automat-
                               ically  decompresses the data for the transform
                               job accordingly. The default value is None .

                            SplitType -> (string)
                               The method to use to split the transform  job's
                               data  files  into smaller batches. Splitting is
                               necessary when the total size of each object is
                               too  large  to fit in a single request. You can
                               also use data splitting to improve  performance
                               by processing multiple concurrent mini-batches.
                               The default value for SplitType is None , which
                               indicates  that input data files are not split,
                               and request payloads contain  the  entire  con-
                               tents of an input object. Set the value of this
                               parameter to Line to split records on a newline
                               character  boundary.  SplitType also supports a
                               number of record-oriented binary data  formats.
                               Currently, the supported record formats are:

                               o RecordIO

                               o TFRecord

                               When  splitting  is  enabled,  the  size  of  a
                               mini-batch depends on the values of the  Batch-
                               Strategy  and  MaxPayloadInMB  parameters. When
                               the value of  BatchStrategy  is  MultiRecord  ,
                               Amazon  SageMaker  sends  the maximum number of
                               records in each request, up to the  MaxPayload-
                               InMB  limit.  If  the value of BatchStrategy is
                               SingleRecord , Amazon SageMaker sends  individ-
                               ual records in each request.

                               NOTE:
                                   Some  data  formats represent a record as a
                                   binary payload wrapped with  extra  padding
                                   bytes.  When  splitting is applied to a bi-
                                   nary data format, padding is removed if the
                                   value  of BatchStrategy is set to SingleRe-
                                   cord . Padding is not removed if the  value
                                   of BatchStrategy is set to MultiRecord .

                        TransformOutput -> (structure)
                            Describes the results of a transform job.

                            S3OutputPath -> (string)
                               The  Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon Sage-
                               Maker to store the  results  of  the  transform
                               job.                For                example,
                               s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                               For every S3  object  used  as  input  for  the
                               transform   job,  batch  transform  stores  the
                               transformed data with an .``out`` suffix  in  a
                               corresponding  subfolder in the location in the
                               output prefix. For example, for the input  data
                               stored    at   s3://bucket-name/input-name-pre-
                               fix/dataset01/data.csv , batch transform stores
                               the  transformed  data at s3://bucket-name/out-
                               put-name-prefix/input-name-prefix/data.csv.out
                               . Batch transform doesn't upload partially pro-
                               cessed objects. For an  input  S3  object  that
                               contains   multiple   records,  it  creates  an
                               .``out`` file only if the  transform  job  suc-
                               ceeds  on  the entire file. When the input con-
                               tains multiple S3 objects, the batch  transform
                               job processes the listed S3 objects and uploads
                               only the output for successfully processed  ob-
                               jects. If any object fails in the transform job
                               batch transform marks  the  job  as  failed  to
                               prompt investigation.

                            Accept -> (string)
                               The  MIME type used to specify the output data.
                               Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME type  with  each
                               http  call  to transfer data from the transform
                               job.

                            AssembleWith -> (string)
                               Defines how to  assemble  the  results  of  the
                               transform  job  as a single S3 object. Choose a
                               format that is most convenient to you. To  con-
                               catenate  the results in binary format, specify
                               None . To add a newline character at the end of
                               every transformed record, specify Line .

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The  Amazon Web Services Key Management Service
                               (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                               Maker  uses  to  encrypt the model artifacts at
                               rest using Amazon  S3  server-side  encryption.
                               The  KmsKeyId  can be any of the following for-
                               mats:

                               o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                               o Key                                      ARN:

                               If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon Sage-
                               Maker  uses  the  default KMS key for Amazon S3
                               for your role's account. For more  information,

                               The KMS key policy must grant permission to the
                               IAM  role  that you specify in your CreateModel
                               request. For more information,  see  Using  Key

                        TransformResources -> (structure)
                            Describes  the  resources,  including  ML instance
                            types and ML instance count, to use for  transform
                            job.

                            InstanceType -> (string)
                               The  ML compute instance type for the transform
                               job. If you are using  built-in  algorithms  to
                               transform  moderately sized datasets, we recom-
                               mend using ml.m4.xlarge or ml.m5.large instance
                               types.

                            InstanceCount -> (integer)
                               The  number  of  ML compute instances to use in
                               the transform job. The default value is 1 , and
                               the  maximum is 100 . For distributed transform
                               jobs, specify a value greater than 1 .

                            VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service
                               (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                               Maker uses to encrypt model data on the storage
                               volume  attached  to the ML compute instance(s)
                               that run the batch transform job.

                               NOTE:
                                   Certain Nitro-based instances include local
                                   storage,  dependent  on  the instance type.
                                   Local storage volumes are encrypted using a
                                   hardware  module on the instance. You can't
                                   request a VolumeKmsKeyId when using an  in-
                                   stance type with local storage.

                                   For  a  list of instance types that support
                                   local instance storage, see Instance  Store
                                   Volumes .

                               The  VolumeKmsKeyId can be any of the following
                               formats:

                               o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                               o Key                                      ARN:

                        CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                            A timestamp that shows when the transform Job  was
                            created.

                        TransformStartTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates  when the transform job starts on ML in-
                            stances. You are billed for the time interval  be-
                            tween  this time and the value of TransformEndTime
                            .

                        TransformEndTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates when the transform  job  has  been  com-
                            pleted,  or  has stopped or failed. You are billed
                            for the time interval between this  time  and  the
                            value of TransformStartTime .

                        LabelingJobArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the labeling job
                            that created the transform job.

                        AutoMLJobArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  AutoML  job
                            that created the transform job.

                        DataProcessing -> (structure)
                            The  data structure used to specify the data to be
                            used for inference in a batch transform job and to
                            associate the data that is relevant to the predic-
                            tion results in the output. The input filter  pro-
                            vided allows you to exclude input data that is not
                            needed for inference in a batch transform job. The
                            output filter provided allows you to include input
                            data relevant to interpreting the  predictions  in
                            the output from the job. For more information, see
                            Associate Prediction  Results  with  their  Corre-

                            InputFilter -> (string)
                               A  JSONPath expression used to select a portion
                               of the input data to pass to the algorithm. Use
                               the  InputFilter  parameter  to exclude fields,
                               such as an ID column, from the  input.  If  you
                               want SageMaker to pass the entire input dataset
                               to the algorithm, accept the default value $ .

                               Examples: "$" , "$[1:]" , "$.features"

                            OutputFilter -> (string)
                               A JSONPath expression used to select a  portion
                               of  the  joined  dataset  to save in the output
                               file for a batch transform  job.  If  you  want
                               SageMaker  to store the entire input dataset in
                               the output file, leave the default value,  $  .
                               If  you  specify indexes that aren't within the
                               dimension size of the joined dataset,  you  get
                               an error.

                               Examples: "$" , "$[0,5:]" , "$['id','SageMaker-
                               Output']"

                            JoinSource -> (string)
                               Specifies the source of the data to  join  with
                               the transformed data. The valid values are None
                               and Input . The default value is None  ,  which
                               specifies not to join the input with the trans-
                               formed data. If you want  the  batch  transform
                               job  to  join  the original input data with the
                               transformed data, set JoinSource to Input . You
                               can  specify OutputFilter as an additional fil-
                               ter to select a portion of the  joined  dataset
                               and store it in the output file.

                               For  JSON  or JSONLines objects, such as a JSON
                               array, SageMaker adds the transformed  data  to
                               the  input  JSON  object in an attribute called
                               SageMakerOutput . The joined  result  for  JSON
                               must  be  a key-value pair object. If the input
                               is not a key-value pair object, SageMaker  cre-
                               ates a new JSON file. In the new JSON file, and
                               the input data is stored under the SageMakerIn-
                               put  key  and  the  results are stored in Sage-
                               MakerOutput .

                               For CSV data, SageMaker takes  each  row  as  a
                               JSON  array and joins the transformed data with
                               the input by appending each transformed row  to
                               the  end  of the input. The joined data has the
                               original input data followed by the transformed
                               data and the output is a CSV file.

                                   A  cron  expression  that describes details
                                   about the monitoring schedule.

                                   The supported cron expressions are:

                                   o If you want to set the job to start every
                                     hour,  use the following:  Hourly: cron(0
                                     * ? * * *)

                                   o If you  want  to  start  the  job  daily:
                                     cron(0 [00-23] ? * * *)

                                   o If  you want to run the job one time, im-
                                     mediately,  use  the  following  keyword:
                                     NOW

                                   For  example,  the following are valid cron
                                   expressions:

                                   o Daily at noon UTC: cron(0 12 ? * * *)

                                   o Daily at midnight UTC: cron(0 0 ? * * *)

                                   To support running every 6, 12  hours,  the
                                   following are also supported:
                                      cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)

                                   For  example,  the following are valid cron
                                   expressions:

                                   o Every 12  hours,  starting  at  5pm  UTC:
                                     cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)

                                   o Every  two  hours  starting  at midnight:
                                     cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)

                                   NOTE:

                                      o Even though the cron expression is set
                                        to  start  at 5PM UTC, note that there
                                        could be a delay of 0-20 minutes  from
                                        the  actual  requested time to run the
                                        execution.

                                      o We recommend that if you would like  a
                                        daily  schedule,  you  do  not provide
                                        this parameter. Amazon SageMaker  will
                                        pick a time for running every day.

                                   You can also specify the keyword NOW to run
                                   the monitoring job immediately,  one  time,
                                   without recurring.

                               DataAnalysisStartTime -> (string)
                                   Sets  the  start  time for a monitoring job
                                   window. Express this time as an  offset  to
                                   the times that you schedule your monitoring
                                   jobs to run. You schedule  monitoring  jobs
                                   with   the   ScheduleExpression  parameter.
                                   Specify this offset in  ISO  8601  duration
                                   format. For example, if you want to monitor
                                   the five hours of data in your dataset that
                                   precede  the  start of each monitoring job,
                                   you would specify: "-PT5H" .

                                   The start time that you  specify  must  not
                                   precede  the  end  time that you specify by
                                   more than 24 hours.  You  specify  the  end
                                   time  with  the DataAnalysisEndTime parame-
                                   ter.

                                   If you set ScheduleExpression to NOW , this
                                   parameter is required.

                               DataAnalysisEndTime -> (string)
                                   Sets the end time for a monitoring job win-
                                   dow. Express this time as an offset to  the
                                   times  that  you  schedule  your monitoring
                                   jobs to run. You schedule  monitoring  jobs
                                   with   the   ScheduleExpression  parameter.
                                   Specify this offset in  ISO  8601  duration
                                   format. For example, if you want to end the
                                   window one hour before the  start  of  each
                                   monitoring  job, you would specify: "-PT1H"
                                   .

                                   The end time that you specify must not fol-
                                   low the start time that you specify by more
                                   than 24 hours. You specify the  start  time
                                   with the DataAnalysisStartTime parameter.

                                   If you set ScheduleExpression to NOW , this
                                   parameter is required.

                                               data for the channel  for  this
                                               datasource.   The  object  that
                                               each S3Uris points to  must  be
                                               readable  by  the IAM role that
                                               Amazon SageMaker uses  to  per-
                                               form tasks on your behalf.

                                   ContentType -> (string)
                                      The multipurpose internet mail extension
                                      (MIME) type of the  data.  Amazon  Sage-
                                      Maker  uses the MIME type with each http
                                      call to transfer data to  the  transform
                                      job.

                                   CompressionType -> (string)
                                      If  your  transform  data is compressed,
                                      specify  the  compression  type.  Amazon
                                      SageMaker automatically decompresses the
                                      data for the transform job  accordingly.
                                      The default value is None .

                                   SplitType -> (string)
                                      The method to use to split the transform
                                      job's data files into  smaller  batches.
                                      Splitting  is  necessary  when the total
                                      size of each object is too large to  fit
                                      in  a  single  request. You can also use
                                      data splitting to improve performance by
                                      processing      multiple      concurrent
                                      mini-batches.  The  default  value   for
                                      SplitType is None , which indicates that
                                      input data files are not split, and  re-
                                      quest  payloads  contain the entire con-
                                      tents of an input object. Set the  value
                                      of  this  parameter  to  Line  to  split
                                      records on a newline character boundary.
                                      SplitType  also  supports  a  number  of
                                      record-oriented  binary  data   formats.
                                      Currently,  the supported record formats
                                      are:

                                      o RecordIO

                                      o TFRecord

                                      When splitting is enabled, the size of a
                                      mini-batch  depends on the values of the
                                      BatchStrategy and MaxPayloadInMB parame-
                                      ters. When the value of BatchStrategy is
                                      MultiRecord , Amazon SageMaker sends the
                                      maximum  number  of  records in each re-
                                      quest, up to the  MaxPayloadInMB  limit.
                                      If  the  value  of BatchStrategy is Sin-
                                      gleRecord , Amazon SageMaker sends indi-
                                      vidual records in each request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Some data formats represent a record
                                          as a binary payload wrapped with ex-
                                          tra padding bytes. When splitting is
                                          applied to  a  binary  data  format,
                                          padding  is  removed if the value of
                                          BatchStrategy is set to SingleRecord
                                          .  Padding  is  not  removed  if the
                                          value of  BatchStrategy  is  set  to
                                          MultiRecord .

                               TransformOutput -> (structure)
                                   Identifies the Amazon S3 location where you
                                   want  Amazon  SageMaker to save the results
                                   from the transform job.

                                   S3OutputPath -> (string)
                                      The Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon
                                      SageMaker  to  store  the results of the
                                      transform     job.     For      example,
                                      s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                                      For  every  S3  object used as input for
                                      the  transform  job,   batch   transform
                                      stores  the  transformed  data  with  an
                                      .``out`` suffix in a corresponding  sub-
                                      folder  in  the  location  in the output
                                      prefix. For example, for the input  data
                                      stored      at      s3://bucket-name/in-
                                      put-name-prefix/dataset01/data.csv     ,
                                      batch  transform  stores the transformed
                                      data      at       s3://bucket-name/out-
                                      put-name-prefix/input-name-pre-
                                      fix/data.csv.out   .   Batch   transform
                                      doesn't  upload  partially processed ob-
                                      jects. For an input S3 object that  con-
                                      tains  multiple  records,  it creates an
                                      .``out`` file only if the transform  job
                                      succeeds  on  the  entire file. When the
                                      input contains multiple S3 objects,  the
                                      batch transform job processes the listed
                                      S3 objects and uploads only  the  output
                                      for  successfully  processed objects. If
                                      any object fails in  the  transform  job
                                      batch  transform marks the job as failed
                                      to prompt investigation.

                                   Accept -> (string)
                                      The MIME type used to specify the output
                                      data.  Amazon  SageMaker  uses  the MIME
                                      type with each  http  call  to  transfer
                                      data from the transform job.

                                   AssembleWith -> (string)
                                      Defines  how  to assemble the results of
                                      the transform job as a single S3 object.
                                      Choose  a format that is most convenient
                                      to you. To concatenate  the  results  in
                                      binary  format,  specify None . To add a
                                      newline character at the  end  of  every
                                      transformed record, specify Line .

                                   KmsKeyId -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Web Services Key Management
                                      Service (Amazon Web  Services  KMS)  key

                               TransformResources -> (structure)
                                   Identifies the ML compute instances for the
                                   transform job.

                                   InstanceType -> (string)
                                      The  ML  compute  instance  type for the
                                      transform job. If you are using built-in
                                      algorithms to transform moderately sized
                                      datasets,     we     recommend     using
                                      ml.m4.xlarge   or  ml.m5.large  instance
                                      types.

                                   InstanceCount -> (integer)
                                      The number of ML  compute  instances  to
                                      use  in  the  transform job. The default
                                      value is 1 , and the maximum  is  100  .
                                      For  distributed transform jobs, specify
                                      a value greater than 1 .

                                   VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Web Services  Key  Management
                                      Service  (Amazon  Web  Services KMS) key
                                      that Amazon SageMaker  uses  to  encrypt

                               job  reaches  the  MaxResource  value,  it   is
                               stopped. If a value for MaxResource is not pro-
                               vided, and Hyperband is selected as the  hyper-
                               parameter  tuning  strategy, HyperbandTrainingJ
                               attempts to infer MaxResource from the  follow-
                               ing keys (if present) in StaticsHyperParameters
                               :

                               If HyperbandStrategyConfig is unable to infer a
                               value  for MaxResource , it generates a valida-
                               tion error. The maximum value is 20,000 epochs.
                               All  metrics  that  correspond  to an objective
                               metric are used to derive early stopping  deci-
                               sions  . For distributive training jobs, ensure
                               that duplicate metrics are not printed  in  the
                               logs  across the individual nodes in a training
                               job. If multiple nodes are publishing duplicate
                               or incorrect metrics, training jobs may make an
                               incorrect stopping decision and  stop  the  job
                               prematurely.

                        ter optimization to find more a consistent hyperparam-

                        Defines the objective metric for a hyperparameter tun-
                        ing job. Hyperparameter tuning uses the value of  this
                        metric  to evaluate the training jobs it launches, and
                        returns the training job that results  in  either  the
                        highest  or lowest value for this metric, depending on
                        the value you specify for the Type parameter.  If  you
                        want  to  define a custom objective metric, see Define
                        metrics and environment variables .

                        cal  hyperparameters  that a hyperparameter tuning job
                        searches.  The  hyperparameter  tuning  job   launches
                        training  jobs with hyperparameter values within these
                        ranges to find the combination of values  that  result
                        in  the training job with the best performance as mea-
                        sured by the objective metric  of  the  hyperparameter
                        tuning job.

                                   The tuning job uses  floating-point  values
                                   between this value and MaxValue for tuning.

                            values to be used by Autotune to determine optimal

                               your  hyperparameter  is eligible for Autotune,

                            The registry path of the Docker  image  that  con-
                            tains  the  training  algorithm.  For  information

                            Maker: Common Parameters . SageMaker supports both
                            registry/repository[:tag]   and   registry/reposi-
                            tory[@digest] image path formats. For more  infor-

                        TrainingInputMode -> (string)
                            The training input mode that  the  algorithm  sup-
                            ports. For more information about input modes, see
                            Algorithms .
                               Pipe mode

                            If an algorithm supports Pipe mode,  Amazon  Sage-
                            Maker  streams data directly from Amazon S3 to the
                            container.
                               File mode

                            If an  algorithm  supports  File  mode,  SageMaker
                            downloads  the training data from S3 to the provi-
                            sioned ML storage volume, and mounts the directory
                            to the Docker volume for the training container.

                            You must provision the ML storage volume with suf-
                            ficient capacity to  accommodate  the  data  down-
                            loaded  from S3. In addition to the training data,
                            the ML  storage  volume  also  stores  the  output
                            model. The algorithm container uses the ML storage
                            volume to also store intermediate information,  if
                            any.

                            For  distributed algorithms, training data is dis-
                            tributed uniformly. Your training duration is pre-
                            dictable  if  the input data objects sizes are ap-
                            proximately the same. SageMaker does not split the
                            files  any  further for model training. If the ob-
                            ject sizes are skewed, training won't  be  optimal
                            as  the  data distribution is also skewed when one
                            host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus be-
                            coming a bottleneck in training.
                               FastFile mode

                            If  an algorithm supports FastFile mode, SageMaker
                            streams data directly from  S3  to  the  container
                            with no code changes, and provides file system ac-
                            cess to the data. Users can author their  training
                            script  to  interact  with  these files as if they
                            were stored on disk.
                               FastFile mode works best when the data is  read
                               sequentially.  Augmented  manifest files aren't
                               supported. The startup time is lower when there
                               are fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

                        AlgorithmName -> (string)
                            The  name of the resource algorithm to use for the
                            hyperparameter tuning job. If you specify a  value
                            for  this  parameter,  do  not specify a value for
                            TrainingImage .

                            (structure)
                               Specifies  a metric that the training algorithm
                               writes to stderr or stdout . You can view these
                               logs  to  understand how your training job per-
                               forms and check for any errors encountered dur-
                               ing  training.  SageMaker hyperparameter tuning
                               captures all defined metrics.  Specify  one  of
                               the defined metrics to use as an objective met-

                        the training jobs that the tuning job launches.

                        (structure)
                            A  channel  is  a named input source that training
                            algorithms can consume.

                            ChannelName -> (string)
                               The name of the channel.

                            DataSource -> (structure)
                               The location of the channel data.

                               S3DataSource -> (structure)
                                   The S3 location of the data source that  is
                                   associated with a channel.

                                   S3DataType -> (string)
                                      If  you  choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identi-
                                      fies a key name prefix.  SageMaker  uses
                                      all objects that match the specified key
                                      name prefix for model training.

                                      If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri iden-
                                      tifies an object that is a manifest file
                                      containing a list of  object  keys  that
                                      you  want  SageMaker  to  use  for model
                                      training.

                                      If you  choose  AugmentedManifestFile  ,
                                      S3Uri  identifies  an  object that is an
                                      augmented manifest file  in  JSON  lines
                                      format.  This file contains the data you
                                      want to use for model training. Augment-
                                      edManifestFile  can  only be used if the
                                      Channel's input mode is Pipe .

                                   S3Uri -> (string)
                                      Depending on the value specified for the
                                      S3DataType  ,  identifies  either  a key
                                      name prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                      o A key  name  prefix  might  look  like
                                        this: s3://bucketname/exampleprefix

                                      o A   manifest  might  look  like  this:
                                        s3://bucketname/example.manifest     A
                                        manifest  is  an  S3 object which is a
                                        JSON file consisting of  an  array  of
                                        elements.  The first element is a pre-
                                        fix which is followed by one  or  more
                                        suffixes. SageMaker appends the suffix
                                        elements to the prefix to get  a  full
                                        set  of  S3Uri  . Note that the prefix
                                        must be a valid non-empty  S3Uri  that
                                        precludes users from specifying a man-
                                        ifest  whose   individual   S3Uri   is
                                        sourced from different S3 buckets. The
                                        following code example shows  a  valid
                                        manifest    format:     [   {"prefix":
                                        "s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/"},

                                        data  source.  The  object  that  each
                                        S3Uri  points  to  must be readable by
                                        the IAM role that  SageMaker  uses  to
                                        perform tasks on your behalf.

                                      Your  input  bucket  must  be located in
                                      same Amazon Web Services region as  your
                                      training job.

                                   S3DataDistributionType -> (string)
                                      If  you  want SageMaker to replicate the
                                      entire dataset on each  ML  compute  in-

                                      ing,  specify  ShardedByS3Key . If there
                                      are n ML compute instances launched  for
                                      a  training  job, each instance gets ap-
                                      proximately 1/n of the number of S3  ob-
                                      jects.  In  this case, model training on
                                      each machine uses  only  the  subset  of
                                      training data.

                                      Don't  choose  more ML compute instances
                                      for training than available S3  objects.
                                      If you do, some nodes won't get any data
                                      and you will pay for nodes  that  aren't
                                      getting  any training data. This applies
                                      in both File and Pipe modes.  Keep  this
                                      in mind when developing algorithms.

                                      In  distributed  training, where you use
                                      multiple ML compute EC2  instances,  you
                                      might choose ShardedByS3Key . If the al-
                                      gorithm requires copying  training  data
                                      to the ML storage volume (when Training-
                                      InputMode is set to File ), this  copies
                                      1/n of the number of objects.

                                   AttributeNames -> (list)
                                      A list of one or more attribute names to
                                      use that are found in a  specified  aug-

                               FileSystemDataSource -> (structure)
                                   The file system that is associated  with  a
                                   channel.

                                   FileSystemId -> (string)
                                      The file system id.

                                   FileSystemAccessMode -> (string)
                                      The  access mode of the mount of the di-
                                      rectory associated with the  channel.  A
                                      directory  can  be  mounted either in ro
                                      (read-only) or rw (read-write) mode.

                                   FileSystemType -> (string)
                                      The file system type.

                                   DirectoryPath -> (string)
                                      The full path to the directory to  asso-
                                      ciate with the channel.

                            ContentType -> (string)
                               The MIME type of the data.

                            CompressionType -> (string)
                               If training data is compressed, the compression
                               type. The default value is None .  Compression-
                               Type  is  used only in Pipe input mode. In File
                               mode, leave this field unset or set it to None.

                            RecordWrapperType -> (string)
                               Specify RecordIO as the value when  input  data
                               is in raw format but the training algorithm re-
                               quires the RecordIO format. In this case, Sage-
                               Maker  wraps  each  individual  S3  object in a
                               RecordIO record. If the input data  is  already
                               in  RecordIO format, you don't need to set this
                               attribute. For more information, see  Create  a
                               Dataset Using RecordIO .

                               In  File mode, leave this field unset or set it
                               to None.

                            InputMode -> (string)
                               (Optional) The input mode to use for  the  data
                               channel  in  a training job. If you don't set a
                               value for InputMode , SageMaker uses the  value
                               set  for TrainingInputMode . Use this parameter
                               to override the TrainingInputMode setting in  a
                               AlgorithmSpecification  request when you have a
                               channel that needs a different input mode  from
                               the training job's general setting. To download
                               the data from  Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service

                               rectly from Amazon S3 to the container,  choose
                               Pipe input mode.

                               To use a model for incremental training, choose

                            ShuffleConfig -> (structure)
                               A configuration for a shuffle option for  input
                               data  in  a  channel.  If  you use S3Prefix for
                               S3DataType , this shuffles the results  of  the
                               S3  key prefix matches. If you use ManifestFile
                               , the order of the S3 object references in  the
                               ManifestFile is shuffled. If you use Augmented-
                               ManifestFile , the order of the JSON  lines  in
                               the   AugmentedManifestFile  is  shuffled.  The
                               shuffling order is determined  using  the  Seed
                               value.

                               For  Pipe  input mode, shuffling is done at the
                               start of every epoch. With large datasets  this
                               ensures  that the order of the training data is
                               different for each epoch, it helps reduce  bias

                               with S3DataDistributionType of ShardedByS3Key ,
                               the data is shuffled across nodes so  that  the
                               content  sent to a particular node on the first
                               epoch might be sent to a different node on  the
                               second epoch.

                               Seed -> (long)
                                   Determines  the shuffling order in Shuffle-

                     VpcConfig -> (structure)
                        The VpcConfig object that specifies the VPC  that  you
                        want the training jobs that this hyperparameter tuning
                        job launches to connect to. Control access to and from
                        your  training  container  by configuring the VPC. For
                        more information, see Protect Training Jobs  by  Using
                        an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud .

                        SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                            The   VPC   security   group   IDs,  in  the  form
                            sg-xxxxxxxx. Specify the security groups  for  the
                            VPC that is specified in the Subnets field.

                            (string)

                        Subnets -> (list)
                            The ID of the subnets in the VPC to which you want
                            to connect your training job or model. For  infor-

                            (string)

                     OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                        Specifies  the  path to the Amazon S3 bucket where you
                        store model artifacts from the training jobs that  the
                        tuning job launches.

                        KmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Web  Services  Key Management Service
                            (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that SageMaker  uses
                            to  encrypt the model artifacts at rest using Ama-
                            zon S3 server-side encryption. The KmsKeyId can be
                            any of the following formats:

                            o //             KMS             Key            ID
                              "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                            o // Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a  KMS  Key
                              "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                            o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                            o // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key Alias
                              "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/Exam-
                              pleAlias"

                            If you use a KMS key ID or an alias  of  your  KMS
                            key,  the  SageMaker  execution  role must include
                            permissions to call kms:Encrypt  .  If  you  don't
                            provide  a  KMS key ID, SageMaker uses the default
                            KMS key for Amazon S3  for  your  role's  account.
                            SageMaker   uses   server-side   encryption   with
                            KMS-managed keys for OutputDataConfig . If you use
                            a  bucket  policy  with an s3:PutObject permission
                            that only allows objects with server-side  encryp-
                            tion,     set     the     condition     key     of
                            s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms" . For
                            more  information, see KMS-Managed Encryption Keys
                            in the Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  Developer
                            Guide.

                            The  KMS  key  policy must grant permission to the
                            IAM role that you  specify  in  your  CreateTrain-
                            ingJob , CreateTransformJob , or CreateHyperParam-

                        S3OutputPath -> (string)
                            Identifies the S3 path where you want SageMaker to
                            store   the   model   artifacts.   For    example,
                            s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                        CompressionType -> (string)
                            The  model output compression type. Select None to
                            output  an  uncompressed  model,  recommended  for
                            large model outputs. Defaults to gzip.

                     ResourceConfig -> (structure)
                        The  resources,  including  the  compute instances and
                        storage volumes, to use for the training jobs that the
                        tuning job launches.

                        Storage  volumes store model artifacts and incremental
                        states. Training algorithms  might  also  use  storage
                        volumes  for  scratch  space. If you want SageMaker to
                        use the storage volume to  store  the  training  data,
                        choose  File as the TrainingInputMode in the algorithm
                        specification. For  distributed  training  algorithms,
                        specify an instance count greater than 1.

                        NOTE:
                            If  you  want  to  use hyperparameter optimization
                            with instance type flexibility,  use  HyperParame-
                            terTuningResourceConfig instead.

                        InstanceType -> (string)
                            The ML compute instance type.

                            NOTE:

                               lease starting December 9th, 2022.
                                   Amazon  EC2  P4de  instances  (currently in
                                   preview) are powered by 8 NVIDIA A100  GPUs
                                   with  80GB  high-performance HBM2e GPU mem-
                                   ory, which accelerate the speed of training
                                   ML  models that need to be trained on large
                                   datasets of high-resolution data.  In  this
                                   preview  release, Amazon SageMaker supports
                                   ML  training   jobs   on   P4de   instances
                                   (ml.p4de.24xlarge  ) to reduce model train-
                                   ing time.  The  ml.p4de.24xlarge  instances
                                   are  available  in the following Amazon Web
                                   Services Regions.

                               o US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)

                               o US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)

                        InstanceCount -> (integer)
                            The number of ML compute  instances  to  use.  For
                            distributed training, provide a value greater than
                            1.

                        VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                            The size of the ML storage volume that you want to
                            provision.

                            ML  storage  volumes store model artifacts and in-
                            cremental states. Training algorithms  might  also
                            use  the  ML  storage volume for scratch space. If
                            you want to store the  training  data  in  the  ML
                            storage  volume, choose File as the TrainingInput-
                            Mode in the algorithm specification.

                            When using an ML instance with NVMe SSD volumes  ,
                            SageMaker  doesn't  provision  Amazon  EBS General
                            Purpose SSD (gp2) storage.  Available  storage  is
                            fixed  to  the NVMe-type instance's storage capac-
                            ity. SageMaker configures storage paths for train-
                            ing  datasets,  checkpoints,  model artifacts, and
                            outputs to use the entire capacity of the instance
                            storage.  For  example,  ML instance families with
                            the NVMe-type instance storage  include  ml.p4d  ,
                            ml.g4dn , and ml.g5 .

                            When  using an ML instance with the EBS-only stor-
                            age option and without instance storage, you  must
                            define  the size of EBS volume through VolumeSize-
                            InGB in the ResourceConfig API.  For  example,  ML
                            instance  families  that  use  EBS volumes include
                            ml.c5 and ml.p2 .

                        VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Web  Services  KMS key that SageMaker
                            uses to encrypt data on  the  storage  volume  at-
                            tached  to the ML compute instance(s) that run the
                            training job.

                            NOTE:
                               Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include  local
                               storage,  dependent on the instance type. Local
                               storage volumes are encrypted using a  hardware
                               module  on  the  instance.  You can't request a
                               VolumeKmsKeyId when using an instance type with
                               local storage.

                               For a list of instance types that support local
                               instance storage, see Instance Store Volumes .

                            The VolumeKmsKeyId can be in any of the  following
                            formats:

                            o //             KMS             Key            ID

                        InstanceGroups -> (list)
                            The configuration of a  heterogeneous  cluster  in
                            JSON format.

                            (structure)
                               Defines  an  instance  group  for heterogeneous
                               cluster training. When  requesting  a  training
                               job  using  the  CreateTrainingJob API, you can
                               configure multiple instance groups .

                               InstanceType -> (string)
                                   Specifies the instance type of the instance
                                   group.

                               InstanceCount -> (integer)
                                   Specifies  the  number  of instances of the
                                   instance group.

                               InstanceGroupName -> (string)
                                   Specifies the name of the instance group.

                        KeepAlivePeriodInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The duration of time in seconds to retain  config-
                            ured  resources  in  a  warm  pool  for subsequent
                            training jobs.

                     StoppingCondition -> (structure)
                        Specifies a limit to how long a  model  hyperparameter
                        training  job  can  run.  It also specifies how long a
                        managed spot training job has to  complete.  When  the
                        job  reaches the time limit, SageMaker ends the train-
                        ing job. Use this API to cap model training costs.

                        MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The maximum length of time,  in  seconds,  that  a
                            training  or  compilation job can run before it is
                            stopped.

                            For compilation jobs, if the job does not complete
                            during this time, a TimeOut error is generated. We
                            recommend starting with 900 seconds and increasing
                            as necessary based on your model.

                            For  all  other jobs, if the job does not complete
                            during this time, SageMaker  ends  the  job.  When
                            RetryStrategy  is  specified  in  the job request,
                            MaxRuntimeInSeconds specifies the maximum time for
                            all  of the attempts in total, not each individual
                            attempt. The default value is 1 day.  The  maximum
                            value is 28 days.

                            The maximum time that a TrainingJob can run in to-
                            tal, including any time spent  publishing  metrics
                            or  archiving  and  uploading  models after it has
                            been stopped, is 30 days.

                        MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The maximum length of time,  in  seconds,  that  a
                            managed  Spot  training job has to complete. It is
                            the amount of time spent waiting for Spot capacity
                            plus  the  amount of time the job can run. It must
                            be equal to or greater than MaxRuntimeInSeconds  .
                            If  the  job  does  not complete during this time,
                            SageMaker ends the job.

                            When RetryStrategy is specified  in  the  job  re-
                            quest,  MaxWaitTimeInSeconds specifies the maximum
                            time for all of the attempts in  total,  not  each
                            individual attempt.

                     EnableNetworkIsolation -> (boolean)
                        Isolates  the  training  container. No inbound or out-
                        bound network calls can be made, except for calls  be-
                        tween  peers within a training cluster for distributed
                        training. If network isolation is  used  for  training
                        jobs that are configured to use a VPC, SageMaker down-
                        loads and uploads customer data  and  model  artifacts
                        through  the specified VPC, but the training container
                        does not have network access.

                     EnableInterContainerTrafficEncryption -> (boolean)
                        To encrypt all communications between ML  compute  in-

                        tion provides greater security for distributed  train-
                        ing, but training might take longer. How long it takes
                        depends on the amount of communication between compute
                        instances, especially if you use a deep learning algo-
                        rithm in distributed training.

                     EnableManagedSpotTraining -> (boolean)

                            Identifies the S3 path where you want SageMaker to
                            store        checkpoints.       For       example,
                            s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                        LocalPath -> (string)
                            (Optional) The local directory  where  checkpoints
                            are    written.    The    default   directory   is
                            /opt/ml/checkpoints/ .

                     RetryStrategy -> (structure)
                        The number of times to retry  the  job  when  the  job
                        fails due to an InternalServerError .

                        MaximumRetryAttempts -> (integer)
                            The number of times to retry the job. When the job
                            is retried, it's  SecondaryStatus  is  changed  to
                            STARTING .

                        sources, including the compute instances  and  storage
                        volumes, used for training jobs launched by the tuning
                        job. By default, storage volumes hold model  artifacts
                        and incremental states. Choose File for TrainingInput-
                        Mode in the AlgorithmSpecification parameter to  addi-

                            jobs (optional). These volumes store  model  arti-
                            facts,  incremental states and optionally, scratch
                            space for training algorithms. Do  not  provide  a
                            value  for this parameter if a value for Instance-

                            Some instance types have a fixed total local stor-
                            age size. If you select one of these instances for
                            training, VolumeSizeInGB cannot  be  greater  than
                            this total size. For a list of instance types with
                            local  instance  storage  and  their  sizes,   see
                            instance store volumes .

                            NOTE:
                               SageMaker supports only the General Purpose SSD
                               (gp2) storage volume type.

                            Some  instances  use  local  storage,  which use a
                            hardware module to encrypt storage volumes. If you
                            choose one of these instance types, you cannot re-
                            quest a VolumeKmsKeyId . For a  list  of  instance
                            types  that  use local storage, see instance store
                            volumes . For more information  about  Amazon  Web

                            tuning  job.  Hyperparameter tuning uses the value
                            of this metric to evaluate the  training  jobs  it
                            launches,  and  returns  the training job that re-
                            sults in either the highest or  lowest  value  for
                            this  metric,  depending  on the value you specify
                            for the Type parameter. If you want  to  define  a
                            custom  objective  metric,  see Define metrics and

                            Specifies ranges of integer, continuous, and cate-
                            gorical hyperparameters that a hyperparameter tun-
                            ing job searches. The  hyperparameter  tuning  job
                            launches  training jobs with hyperparameter values
                            within these ranges to  find  the  combination  of
                            values  that  result  in the training job with the
                            best performance as measured by the objective met-
                            ric of the hyperparameter tuning job.

                            NOTE:
                               The maximum number of items specified for Array
                               Members refers to the maximum number of  hyper-
                               parameters  for each range and also the maximum
                               for the hyperparameter tuning job itself.  That
                               is,  the  sum  of the number of hyperparameters
                               for all the ranges  can't  exceed  the  maximum
                               number specified.

                            IntegerParameterRanges -> (list)

                               a hyperparameter tuning job searches.

                               (structure)

                                   MinValue -> (string)
                                      The minimum value of the  hyperparameter
                                      to search.

                                      Hyperparameter  tuning searches the val-
                                      ues in the hyperparameter range by using

                                          Logarithmic

                                      Hyperparameter  tuning searches the val-
                                      ues in the hyperparameter range by using
                                      a logarithmic scale.

                                      Logarithmic   scaling   works  only  for
                                      ranges that  have  only  values  greater
                                      than 0.

                                      ter. The tuning job uses  floating-point
                                      values  between  this value and MaxValue
                                      for tuning.

                                   MaxValue -> (string)

                                      ter.  The tuning job uses floating-point
                                      values between MinValue value  and  this
                                      value for tuning.

                                      uses to search the hyperparameter range.

                                      Hyperparameter tuning searches the  val-
                                      ues in the hyperparameter range by using
                                      a linear scale.
                                          Logarithmic

                                      Hyperparameter tuning searches the  val-
                                      ues in the hyperparameter range by using
                                      a logarithmic scale.

                                      Logarithmic  scaling  works   only   for
                                      ranges  that  have  only  values greater
                                      than 0.
                                          ReverseLogarithmic

                                      Hyperparameter tuning searches the  val-
                                      ues in the hyperparameter range by using
                                      a reverse logarithmic scale.

                                      Reverse logarithmic scaling  works  only
                                      for  ranges that are entirely within the
                                      range 0<=x<1.0.

                                   If  Automatic model tuning (AMT) determines
                                   that your hyperparameter  is  eligible  for

                               tains the training algorithm.  For  information

                               istry/repository[@digest]  image  path formats.

                            TrainingInputMode -> (string)

                               ports. For more information about input  modes,

                                   Pipe mode

                               If  an  algorithm  supports  Pipe  mode, Amazon
                               SageMaker streams data directly from Amazon  S3
                               to the container.
                                   File mode

                               If  an  algorithm supports File mode, SageMaker
                               downloads the training data from S3 to the pro-
                               visioned  ML storage volume, and mounts the di-
                               rectory to the Docker volume for  the  training
                               container.

                               You  must  provision the ML storage volume with
                               sufficient capacity  to  accommodate  the  data
                               downloaded from S3. In addition to the training
                               data, the ML storage  volume  also  stores  the
                               output  model. The algorithm container uses the
                               ML storage volume to  also  store  intermediate
                               information, if any.

                               For  distributed  algorithms,  training data is
                               distributed uniformly. Your  training  duration
                               is  predictable if the input data objects sizes
                               are approximately the same. SageMaker does  not
                               split the files any further for model training.
                               If the object sizes are skewed, training  won't
                               be  optimal  as  the  data distribution is also
                               skewed when one host in a training  cluster  is
                               overloaded,   thus  becoming  a  bottleneck  in
                               training.
                                   FastFile mode

                               If an algorithm supports FastFile  mode,  Sage-
                               Maker streams data directly from S3 to the con-
                               tainer with no code changes, and provides  file
                               system  access  to  the  data. Users can author
                               their training script to  interact  with  these
                               files as if they were stored on disk.
                                   FastFile  mode  works best when the data is
                                   read sequentially. Augmented manifest files
                                   aren't supported. The startup time is lower
                                   when there are fewer files in the S3 bucket
                                   provided.

                            AlgorithmName -> (string)
                               The  name  of the resource algorithm to use for
                               the hyperparameter tuning job. If you specify a
                               value  for  this  parameter,  do  not specify a
                               value for TrainingImage .

                            MetricDefinitions -> (list)
                               An array of MetricDefinition objects that spec-
                               ify the metrics that the algorithm emits.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies  a metric that the training algo-
                                   rithm writes to stderr or stdout . You  can
                                   view  these  logs  to  understand  how your
                                   training job performs and check for any er-
                                   rors encountered during training. SageMaker
                                   hyperparameter tuning captures all  defined
                                   metrics. Specify one of the defined metrics
                                   to use as an  objective  metric  using  the
                                   TuningObjective  parameter  in the HyperPa-

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the metric.

                                   Regex -> (string)
                                      A regular expression that  searches  the
                                      output  of  a  training job and gets the
                                      value of the metric. For  more  informa-

                        RoleArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role as-
                            sociated with the training jobs  that  the  tuning
                            job launches.

                        InputDataConfig -> (list)
                            An array of Channel objects that specify the input
                            for  the  training  jobs  that  the   tuning   job
                            launches.

                            (structure)
                               A channel is a named input source that training
                               algorithms can consume.

                               ChannelName -> (string)
                                   The name of the channel.

                               DataSource -> (structure)
                                   The location of the channel data.

                                   S3DataSource -> (structure)
                                      The S3 location of the data source  that
                                      is associated with a channel.

                                      S3DataType -> (string)
                                          If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri iden-
                                          tifies a key name prefix.  SageMaker
                                          uses  all  objects  that  match  the
                                          specified key name prefix for  model
                                          training.

                                          If  you  choose ManifestFile , S3Uri
                                          identifies an object that is a mani-
                                          fest  file  containing a list of ob-
                                          ject keys that you want SageMaker to
                                          use for model training.

                                          If  you choose AugmentedManifestFile
                                          , S3Uri identifies an object that is
                                          an  augmented  manifest file in JSON
                                          lines format. This file contains the
                                          data  you  want  to  use  for  model
                                          training. AugmentedManifestFile  can
                                          only  be used if the Channel's input
                                          mode is Pipe .

                                      S3Uri -> (string)
                                          Depending on the value specified for
                                          the S3DataType , identifies either a
                                          key name prefix or a  manifest.  For
                                          example:

                                          o A  key name prefix might look like
                                            this:  s3://bucketname/examplepre-
                                            fix

                                          o A  manifest  might look like this:
                                            s3://bucketname/example.manifest
                                            A  manifest  is an S3 object which
                                            is a JSON file  consisting  of  an
                                            array  of elements. The first ele-
                                            ment is a prefix which is followed
                                            by one or more suffixes. SageMaker
                                            appends the suffix elements to the
                                            prefix  to get a full set of S3Uri
                                            . Note that the prefix must  be  a
                                            valid  non-empty  S3Uri  that pre-
                                            cludes  users  from  specifying  a
                                            manifest whose individual S3Uri is
                                            sourced from different S3 buckets.
                                            The following code example shows a
                                            valid manifest format:   [  {"pre-
                                            fix":                   "s3://cus-

                                            "relative/path/custdata-N"       ]
                                            This JSON  is  equivalent  to  the

                                            fest is the  input  data  for  the
                                            channel  for this data source. The
                                            object that each S3Uri  points  to
                                            must  be  readable by the IAM role
                                            that  SageMaker  uses  to  perform
                                            tasks on your behalf.

                                          Your input bucket must be located in
                                          same Amazon Web Services  region  as
                                          your training job.

                                      S3DataDistributionType -> (string)
                                          If  you  want SageMaker to replicate
                                          the entire dataset on each  ML  com-

                                          cated .

                                          If you want SageMaker to replicate a
                                          subset of data on  each  ML  compute
                                          instance  that is launched for model
                                          training, specify  ShardedByS3Key  .
                                          If  there are n ML compute instances
                                          launched for a  training  job,  each
                                          instance  gets  approximately 1/n of
                                          the number of S3  objects.  In  this
                                          case, model training on each machine
                                          uses only  the  subset  of  training
                                          data.

                                          Don't  choose  more  ML  compute in-
                                          stances for training than  available
                                          S3  objects.  If  you do, some nodes
                                          won't get any data and you will  pay
                                          for  nodes  that  aren't getting any
                                          training data. This applies in  both
                                          File  and  Pipe  modes. Keep this in
                                          mind when developing algorithms.

                                          In distributed training,  where  you
                                          use  multiple  ML  compute  EC2  in-
                                          stances, you might  choose  Sharded-
                                          ByS3Key  . If the algorithm requires
                                          copying  training  data  to  the  ML

                                          1/n of the number of objects.

                                      AttributeNames -> (list)

                                      a channel.

                                      FileSystemId -> (string)
                                          The file system id.

                                      FileSystemAccessMode -> (string)
                                          The access mode of the mount of  the
                                          directory  associated with the chan-
                                          nel. A directory can be mounted  ei-
                                          ther   in   ro   (read-only)  or  rw
                                          (read-write) mode.

                                      FileSystemType -> (string)
                                          The file system type.

                                      DirectoryPath -> (string)
                                          The full path to  the  directory  to
                                          associate with the channel.

                               ContentType -> (string)
                                   The MIME type of the data.

                               CompressionType -> (string)
                                   If  training  data  is compressed, the com-
                                   pression type. The default value is None  .
                                   CompressionType  is used only in Pipe input
                                   mode. In File mode, leave this field  unset
                                   or set it to None.

                               RecordWrapperType -> (string)
                                   Specify  RecordIO  as  the value when input
                                   data is in raw format but the training  al-
                                   gorithm  requires  the  RecordIO format. In
                                   this case, SageMaker wraps each  individual
                                   S3  object in a RecordIO record. If the in-
                                   put data is already in RecordIO format, you
                                   don't  need to set this attribute. For more
                                   information, see  Create  a  Dataset  Using
                                   RecordIO .

                                   In File mode, leave this field unset or set
                                   it to None.

                               InputMode -> (string)
                                   (Optional) The input mode to  use  for  the
                                   data  channel  in  a  training  job. If you
                                   don't set a value for InputMode , SageMaker
                                   uses  the value set for TrainingInputMode .
                                   Use this parameter to override  the  Train-

                                   ting. To download the data from Amazon Sim-
                                   ple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to the pro-
                                   visioned  ML  storage volume, and mount the
                                   directory to a Docker volume, use File  in-
                                   put mode. To stream data directly from Ama-
                                   zon S3 to the container, choose Pipe  input
                                   mode.

                                   To  use  a  model for incremental training,
                                   choose File input model.

                               ShuffleConfig -> (structure)
                                   A configuration for a  shuffle  option  for
                                   input  data in a channel. If you use S3Pre-
                                   fix for S3DataType , this shuffles the  re-
                                   sults  of the S3 key prefix matches. If you
                                   use ManifestFile , the order of the S3  ob-
                                   ject  references  in  the  ManifestFile  is
                                   shuffled. If you use  AugmentedManifestFile
                                   ,  the  order of the JSON lines in the Aug-
                                   mentedManifestFile is shuffled.  The  shuf-
                                   fling  order  is  determined using the Seed
                                   value.

                                   For Pipe input mode, shuffling is  done  at
                                   the   start  of  every  epoch.  With  large
                                   datasets this ensures that the order of the
                                   training  data is different for each epoch,
                                   it helps reduce bias and possible  overfit-
                                   ting.  In  a  multi-node  training job when
                                   ShuffleConfig is combined  with  S3DataDis-
                                   tributionType  of ShardedByS3Key , the data
                                   is shuffled across nodes so that  the  con-
                                   tent sent to a particular node on the first
                                   epoch might be sent to a different node  on
                                   the second epoch.

                                   Seed -> (long)
                                      Determines  the shuffling order in Shuf-

                        VpcConfig -> (structure)
                            The VpcConfig object that specifies the  VPC  that
                            you  want the training jobs that this hyperparame-
                            ter tuning job launches to connect to. Control ac-

                            SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                               The  VPC  security  group  IDs,  in  the   form
                               sg-xxxxxxxx.  Specify  the  security groups for

                            Subnets -> (list)
                               The ID of the subnets in the VPC to  which  you
                               want to connect your training job or model. For

                               (string)

                        OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                            Specifies the path to the Amazon S3  bucket  where
                            you  store  model artifacts from the training jobs
                            that the tuning job launches.

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service
                               (Amazon  Web  Services  KMS) key that SageMaker
                               uses to encrypt the model artifacts at rest us-
                               ing   Amazon  S3  server-side  encryption.  The
                               KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

                               o //           KMS            Key            ID
                                 "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                               o //  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a KMS Key
                                 "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                               o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                               o //  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a KMS Key
                                 Alias
                                 "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/Ex-
                                 ampleAlias"

                               If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your KMS
                               key,  the SageMaker execution role must include
                               permissions to call kms:Encrypt . If you  don't
                               provide  a  KMS  key ID, SageMaker uses the de-
                               fault KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's ac-
                               count.  SageMaker  uses  server-side encryption
                               with KMS-managed keys for OutputDataConfig . If
                               you  use  a  bucket policy with an s3:PutObject
                               permission  that  only  allows   objects   with
                               server-side  encryption,  set the condition key
                               of s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms"
                               . For more information, see KMS-Managed Encryp-

                               The KMS key policy must grant permission to the
                               IAM role that you specify in your  CreateTrain-

                            S3OutputPath -> (string)
                               Identifies the S3 path where you want SageMaker
                               to store  the  model  artifacts.  For  example,
                               s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                            CompressionType -> (string)
                               The  model output compression type. Select None
                               to output an  uncompressed  model,  recommended
                               for large model outputs. Defaults to gzip.

                        ResourceConfig -> (structure)
                            The resources, including the compute instances and
                            storage volumes, to use for the training jobs that
                            the tuning job launches.

                            Storage  volumes  store model artifacts and incre-
                            mental states. Training algorithms might also  use
                            storage  volumes  for  scratch  space. If you want
                            SageMaker to use the storage volume to  store  the
                            training  data,  choose File as the TrainingInput-
                            Mode in the algorithm specification. For  distrib-
                            uted  training  algorithms,  specify  an  instance
                            count greater than 1.

                            NOTE:
                               If you want to use hyperparameter  optimization
                               with instance type flexibility, use HyperParam-
                               eterTuningResourceConfig instead.

                            InstanceType -> (string)
                               The ML compute instance type.

                               NOTE:

                                      Amazon EC2 P4de instances (currently  in
                                      preview)  are  powered  by 8 NVIDIA A100
                                      GPUs with  80GB  high-performance  HBM2e
                                      GPU  memory,  which accelerate the speed
                                      of training ML models that  need  to  be
                                      trained  on large datasets of high-reso-
                                      lution data. In  this  preview  release,
                                      Amazon  SageMaker  supports  ML training
                                      jobs on P4de instances (ml.p4de.24xlarge

                            InstanceCount -> (integer)
                               The  number of ML compute instances to use. For
                               distributed training, provide a  value  greater
                               than 1.

                            VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                               The size of the ML storage volume that you want
                               to provision.

                               ML storage volumes store  model  artifacts  and
                               incremental  states.  Training algorithms might
                               also use the  ML  storage  volume  for  scratch
                               space.  If  you want to store the training data
                               in the ML storage volume, choose  File  as  the
                               TrainingInputMode  in  the algorithm specifica-
                               tion.

                               When using an ML instance with NVMe SSD volumes
                               ,  SageMaker  doesn't provision Amazon EBS Gen-
                               eral Purpose SSD (gp2) storage. Available stor-
                               age  is fixed to the NVMe-type instance's stor-
                               age  capacity.  SageMaker  configures   storage
                               paths for training datasets, checkpoints, model
                               artifacts, and outputs to use the entire capac-
                               ity  of  the  instance storage. For example, ML
                               instance families with the  NVMe-type  instance
                               storage include ml.p4d , ml.g4dn , and ml.g5 .

                               When  using  an  ML  instance with the EBS-only
                               storage option and  without  instance  storage,
                               you  must define the size of EBS volume through
                               VolumeSizeInGB in the ResourceConfig  API.  For
                               example, ML instance families that use EBS vol-
                               umes include ml.c5 and ml.p2 .

                            VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The Amazon Web Services KMS key that  SageMaker
                               uses  to encrypt data on the storage volume at-
                               tached to the ML compute instance(s)  that  run
                               the training job.

                               NOTE:
                                   Certain Nitro-based instances include local
                                   storage, dependent on  the  instance  type.
                                   Local storage volumes are encrypted using a
                                   hardware module on the instance. You  can't
                                   request  a VolumeKmsKeyId when using an in-
                                   stance type with local storage.

                               The VolumeKmsKeyId can be in any of the follow-
                               ing formats:

                            InstanceGroups -> (list)
                               The configuration of a heterogeneous cluster in
                               JSON format.

                               (structure)
                                   Defines an instance group for heterogeneous
                                   cluster training. When requesting a  train-
                                   ing  job  using  the CreateTrainingJob API,
                                   you can configure multiple instance  groups
                                   .

                                   InstanceType -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  instance type of the in-
                                      stance group.

                                   InstanceCount -> (integer)
                                      Specifies the number of instances of the
                                      instance group.

                                   InstanceGroupName -> (string)
                                      Specifies   the  name  of  the  instance
                                      group.

                            KeepAlivePeriodInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The duration of time in seconds to retain  con-
                               figured resources in a warm pool for subsequent
                               training jobs.

                        StoppingCondition -> (structure)
                            Specifies a limit to how long a model hyperparame-
                            ter  training  job  can run. It also specifies how
                            long a managed spot training job has to  complete.
                            When  the  job  reaches  the time limit, SageMaker
                            ends the training job. Use this API to  cap  model
                            training costs.

                            MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The  maximum length of time, in seconds, that a
                               training or compilation job can run  before  it
                               is stopped.

                               For  compilation jobs, if the job does not com-
                               plete during this time, a TimeOut error is gen-
                               erated.  We recommend starting with 900 seconds
                               and  increasing  as  necessary  based  on  your
                               model.

                               For  all  other  jobs, if the job does not com-
                               plete during this time, SageMaker ends the job.
                               When  RetryStrategy is specified in the job re-
                               quest, MaxRuntimeInSeconds specifies the  maxi-
                               mum  time for all of the attempts in total, not
                               each individual attempt. The default value is 1
                               day. The maximum value is 28 days.

                               The  maximum time that a TrainingJob can run in
                               total, including any time spent publishing met-
                               rics or archiving and uploading models after it
                               has been stopped, is 30 days.

                            MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The maximum length of time, in seconds, that  a
                               managed  Spot  training job has to complete. It
                               is the amount of time spent  waiting  for  Spot
                               capacity  plus  the  amount of time the job can
                               run. It  must  be  equal  to  or  greater  than
                               MaxRuntimeInSeconds  . If the job does not com-
                               plete during this time, SageMaker ends the job.

                               When RetryStrategy is specified in the job  re-
                               quest, MaxWaitTimeInSeconds specifies the maxi-
                               mum time for all of the attempts in total,  not
                               each individual attempt.

                        EnableNetworkIsolation -> (boolean)
                            Isolates  the  training  container.  No inbound or
                            outbound network calls can  be  made,  except  for
                            calls  between peers within a training cluster for
                            distributed training. If network isolation is used
                            for  training  jobs  that  are configured to use a
                            VPC, SageMaker downloads and uploads customer data
                            and model artifacts through the specified VPC, but
                            the training container does not have  network  ac-
                            cess.

                        EnableInterContainerTrafficEncryption -> (boolean)
                            To  encrypt  all communications between ML compute
                            instances in distributed training, choose  True  .
                            Encryption  provides greater security for distrib-
                            uted training, but training might take longer. How
                            long  it takes depends on the amount of communica-
                            tion between compute instances, especially if  you
                            use  a  deep  learning  algorithm  in  distributed
                            training.

                        EnableManagedSpotTraining -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean indicating whether managed spot training
                            is enabled (True ) or not (False ).

                        CheckpointConfig -> (structure)
                            Contains information about the output location for
                            managed spot training checkpoint data.

                            S3Uri -> (string)
                               Identifies the S3 path where you want SageMaker
                               to     store    checkpoints.    For    example,
                               s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                            LocalPath -> (string)
                               (Optional) The  local  directory  where  check-
                               points  are  written.  The default directory is
                               /opt/ml/checkpoints/ .

                        RetryStrategy -> (structure)
                            The number of times to retry the job when the  job
                            fails due to an InternalServerError .

                            MaximumRetryAttempts -> (integer)
                               The  number of times to retry the job. When the
                               job is retried, it's SecondaryStatus is changed
                               to STARTING .

                        HyperParameterTuningResourceConfig -> (structure)
                            The  configuration  for  the hyperparameter tuning
                            resources, including  the  compute  instances  and
                            storage  volumes,  used for training jobs launched
                            by the tuning job.  By  default,  storage  volumes
                            hold   model  artifacts  and  incremental  states.
                            Choose File for  TrainingInputMode  in  the  Algo-
                            rithmSpecification parameter to additionally store
                            training data in the storage volume (optional).

                            InstanceType -> (string)
                               The instance type used  to  run  hyperparameter
                               optimization  tuning  jobs. See descriptions of
                               instance types for more information.

                            InstanceCount -> (integer)
                               The number of compute  instances  of  type  In-
                               stanceType  to  use. For distributed training ,
                               select a value greater than 1.

                            VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                               The volume size in GB for the storage volume to

                               tion jobs (optional). These volumes store model
                               artifacts,  incremental  states and optionally,
                               scratch space for training algorithms.  Do  not
                               provide  a  value for this parameter if a value
                               for InstanceConfigs is also specified.

                               Some instance types have a  fixed  total  local
                               storage  size.  If  you select one of these in-
                               stances for training, VolumeSizeInGB cannot  be
                               greater than this total size. For a list of in-
                               stance types with local  instance  storage  and
                               their sizes, see instance store volumes .

                               NOTE:
                                   SageMaker supports only the General Purpose
                                   SSD (gp2) storage volume type.

                            VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                               A key used by Amazon Web Services  Key  Manage-
                               ment  Service  to  encrypt  data on the storage
                               volume attached to the compute  instances  used
                               to  run the training job. You can use either of
                               the following formats to specify a key.

                               KMS Key ID:
                                   "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                               Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key:
                                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                               Some  instances  use local storage, which use a
                               hardware module to encrypt storage volumes.  If
                               you  choose  one  of  these instance types, you
                               cannot request a VolumeKmsKeyId . For a list of
                               instance  types  that  use  local  storage, see

                               jobs. These resources include compute instances
                               and  storage  volumes  to use in model training
                               jobs launched by  hyperparameter  tuning  jobs.
                               The  AllocationStrategy  controls  the order in
                               which multiple configurations provided  in  In-

                        training instances. You are billed for the time inter-
                        val  between  the  value of TrainingStartTime and this
                        time. For successful jobs and stopped  jobs,  this  is
                        the  time  after  model  artifacts  are  uploaded. For
                        failed jobs, this is the time when SageMaker detects a
                        job failure.

                            The name of the objective  metric.  For  SageMaker
                            built-in algorithms, metrics are defined per algo-
                            rithm. See the metrics for XGBoost as an  example.
                            You  can  also use a custom algorithm for training
                            and define your own metrics. For more information,

                          ing  job  was evaluated by the hyperparameter tuning
                          job and used in the hyperparameter tuning process.

                        o Pending: The training job is in progress and evalua-
                          tion of its final objective metric is pending.

                        o Failed:  The final objective metric for the training
                          job was not evaluated, and was not used in  the  hy-
                          perparameter  tuning  process. This typically occurs
                          when the training job failed or did not emit an  ob-
                          jective metric.

                     TrainingJobName -> (string)
                        The name of the training job.

                     TrainingJobArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the training job.

                     TuningJobName -> (string)
                        The HyperParameter tuning job that launched the train-
                        ing job.

                     CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time that the training job was created.

                     TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time that the training job started.

                     TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                        Specifies  the  time  when  the  training  job ends on
                        training instances. You are billed for the time inter-
                        val  between  the  value of TrainingStartTime and this
                        time. For successful jobs and stopped  jobs,  this  is
                        the  time  after  model  artifacts  are  uploaded. For
                        failed jobs, this is the time when SageMaker detects a
                        job failure.

                     TrainingJobStatus -> (string)
                        The status of the training job.

                     TunedHyperParameters -> (map)
                        A  list of the hyperparameters for which you specified
                        ranges to search.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     FailureReason -> (string)
                        The reason that the training job failed.

                     FinalHyperParameterTuningJobObjectiveMetric  ->   (struc-
                     ture)
                        The FinalHyperParameterTuningJobObjectiveMetric object
                        that specifies the value of the  objective  metric  of
                        the tuning job that launched this training job.

                        Type -> (string)
                            Select if you want to minimize or maximize the ob-
                            jective metric during hyperparameter tuning.

                        MetricName -> (string)
                            The name of the objective  metric.  For  SageMaker
                            built-in algorithms, metrics are defined per algo-
                            rithm. See the metrics for XGBoost as an  example.
                            You  can  also use a custom algorithm for training
                            and define your own metrics. For more information,
                            see Define metrics and environment variables .

                        Value -> (float)
                            The value of the objective metric.

                     ObjectiveStatus -> (string)
                        The  status  of  the objective metric for the training
                        job:

                        o Succeeded: The final objective metric for the train-
                          ing  job  was evaluated by the hyperparameter tuning
                          job and used in the hyperparameter tuning process.

                        o Pending: The training job is in progress and evalua-
                          tion of its final objective metric is pending.

                        o Failed:  The final objective metric for the training
                          job was not evaluated, and was not used in  the  hy-
                          perparameter  tuning  process. This typically occurs
                          when the training job failed or did not emit an  ob-
                          jective metric.

                 WarmStartConfig -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the  configuration for a hyperparameter tuning
                     job that uses one or more previous hyperparameter  tuning
                     jobs  as a starting point. The results of previous tuning
                     jobs are used to inform which combinations of hyperparam-
                     eters to search over in the new tuning job.

                     All training jobs launched by the new hyperparameter tun-
                     ing job are evaluated by using the objective metric,  and
                     the  training  job  that performs the best is compared to
                     the best training jobs from the parent tuning jobs.  From
                     these,  the  training  job that performs the best as mea-
                     sured by the objective metric is returned as the  overall
                     best training job.

                     NOTE:
                        All  training  jobs  launched by parent hyperparameter
                        tuning jobs and the  new  hyperparameter  tuning  jobs
                        count  against the limit of training jobs for the tun-
                        ing job.

                     ParentHyperParameterTuningJobs -> (list)
                        An array of hyperparameter tuning jobs that  are  used
                        as  the starting point for the new hyperparameter tun-
                        ing job. For more information about  warm  starting  a
                        hyperparameter tuning job, see Using a Previous Hyper-
                        parameter Tuning Job as a Starting Point .

                        Hyperparameter tuning jobs created before  October  1,
                        2018 cannot be used as parent jobs for warm start tun-
                        ing jobs.

                        (structure)
                            A previously completed or  stopped  hyperparameter
                            tuning  job  to  be used as a starting point for a
                            new hyperparameter tuning job.

                            HyperParameterTuningJobName -> (string)
                               The name of the hyperparameter tuning job to be
                               used as a starting point for a new hyperparame-
                               ter tuning job.

                     WarmStartType -> (string)
                        Specifies one of the following:
                            IDENTICAL_DATA_AND_ALGORITHM

                        The new hyperparameter tuning job uses the same  input
                        data and training image as the parent tuning jobs. You
                        can change the hyperparameter ranges to search and the
                        maximum  number of training jobs that the hyperparame-
                        ter tuning job launches. You cannot use a new  version
                        of  the  training algorithm, unless the changes in the
                        new version do not affect the  algorithm  itself.  For
                        example,  changes  that improve logging or adding sup-
                        port for a different data format are allowed. You  can
                        also  change  hyperparameters  from tunable to static,
                        and from static to tunable, but the  total  number  of
                        static  plus  tunable  hyperparameters must remain the
                        same as it is in all parent jobs. The objective metric
                        for  the  new  tuning  job must be the same as for all
                        parent jobs.
                            TRANSFER_LEARNING

                        The new hyperparameter tuning job  can  include  input
                        data, hyperparameter ranges, maximum number of concur-
                        rent training jobs, and  maximum  number  of  training
                        jobs  that  are different than those of its parent hy-
                        perparameter tuning jobs. The training image can  also
                        be  a  different  version from the version used in the
                        parent hyperparameter tuning job. You can also  change
                        hyperparameters  from  tunable  to  static,  and  from
                        static to tunable, but the total number of static plus
                        tunable  hyperparameters must remain the same as it is
                        in all parent jobs. The objective metric for  the  new
                        tuning job must be the same as for all parent jobs.

                 FailureReason -> (string)
                     The  error  that was created when a hyperparameter tuning
                     job failed.

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The tags associated with a hyperparameter tuning job. For
                     more  information  see  Tagging  Amazon  Web Services re-
                     sources .

                     (structure)

                        value,  used  to  manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon
                        Web Services resources.

                        You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs,
                        hyperparameter tuning jobs, batch transform jobs, mod-
                        els, labeling jobs, work  teams,  endpoint  configura-
                        tions,  and  endpoints. For more information on adding

                        Key -> (string)
                            The tag key. Tag keys must be unique per resource.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The tag value.

                 TuningJobCompletionDetails -> (structure)
                     Information about either a current or completed  hyperpa-
                     rameter tuning job.

                     NumberOfTrainingJobsObjectiveNotImproving -> (integer)
                        The  number  of training jobs launched by a tuning job
                        that are not improving (1% or  less)  as  measured  by
                        model performance evaluated against an objective func-
                        tion.

                     ConvergenceDetectedTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time in timestamp format that AMT  detected  model
                        convergence,  as  defined by a lack of significant im-
                        provement over time based on criteria developed over a
                        wide range of diverse benchmarking tests.

                 ConsumedResources -> (structure)
                     The  total amount of resources consumed by a hyperparame-
                     ter tuning job.

                     RuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The wall clock runtime in seconds used by your  hyper-
                        parameter tuning job.

              Model -> (structure)
                 A model displayed in the Amazon SageMaker Model Dashboard.

                 Model -> (structure)
                     A model displayed in the Model Dashboard.

                     ModelName -> (string)
                        The name of the model.

                     PrimaryContainer -> (structure)
                        Describes the container, as part of model definition.

                        ContainerHostname -> (string)
                            This  parameter is ignored for models that contain
                            only a PrimaryContainer .

                            When a ContainerDefinition is part of an inference
                            pipeline,  the  value  of  the  parameter uniquely
                            identifies the container for the purposes of  log-
                            ging  and  metrics.  For information, see Use Logs
                            and Metrics to Monitor an Inference Pipeline .  If
                            you don't specify a value for this parameter for a
                            ContainerDefinition that is part of  an  inference
                            pipeline,  a unique name is automatically assigned
                            based on the position of  the  ContainerDefinition
                            in  the  pipeline.  If you specify a value for the
                            ContainerHostName for any ContainerDefinition that
                            is part of an inference pipeline, you must specify
                            a value for the ContainerHostName parameter of ev-
                            ery ContainerDefinition in that pipeline.

                        Image -> (string)
                            The  path where inference code is stored. This can
                            be either in Amazon EC2 Container Registry or in a
                            Docker  registry  that is accessible from the same
                            VPC that you configure for your endpoint.  If  you
                            are  using your own custom algorithm instead of an
                            algorithm provided  by  SageMaker,  the  inference
                            code  must  meet SageMaker requirements. SageMaker
                            supports both registry/repository[:tag]  and  reg-
                            istry/repository[@digest]  image path formats. For
                            more information, see Using  Your  Own  Algorithms
                            with Amazon SageMaker .

                            NOTE:
                               The  model artifacts in an Amazon S3 bucket and
                               the Docker image  for  inference  container  in
                               Amazon  EC2  Container  Registry must be in the
                               same region as the model or  endpoint  you  are
                               creating.

                        ImageConfig -> (structure)
                            Specifies whether the model container is in Amazon
                            ECR or a private Docker registry  accessible  from
                            your  Amazon  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). For in-
                            formation about storing containers  in  a  private
                            Docker registry, see Use a Private Docker Registry
                            for Real-Time Inference Containers .

                            NOTE:
                               The model artifacts in an Amazon S3 bucket  and
                               the  Docker  image  for  inference container in
                               Amazon EC2 Container Registry must  be  in  the
                               same  region  as  the model or endpoint you are
                               creating.

                            RepositoryAccessMode -> (string)
                               Set this to one of the following values:

                            RepositoryAuthConfig -> (structure)
                               (Optional) Specifies an authentication configu-
                               ration  for  the  private docker registry where
                               your model image is hosted. Specify a value for
                               this  property only if you specified Vpc as the
                               value for the RepositoryAccessMode  field,  and
                               the private Docker registry where the model im-

                               RepositoryCredentialsProviderArn -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon
                                   Web  Services Lambda function that provides

                        Mode -> (string)
                            Whether the container hosts a single model or mul-
                            tiple models.

                        ModelDataUrl -> (string)
                            The  S3  path where the model artifacts, which re-
                            sult from model training, are  stored.  This  path
                            must point to a single gzip compressed tar archive
                            (.tar.gz suffix). The  S3  path  is  required  for
                            SageMaker  built-in algorithms, but not if you use
                            your  own  algorithms.  For  more  information  on
                            built-in algorithms, see Common Parameters .

                            NOTE:
                               The  model  artifacts  must  be in an S3 bucket
                               that is in the same region as the model or end-
                               point you are creating.

                            If  you  provide a value for this parameter, Sage-
                            Maker uses Amazon Web Services Security Token Ser-
                            vice  to download model artifacts from the S3 path
                            you provide. Amazon Web Services STS is  activated
                            in your Amazon Web Services account by default. If
                            you previously deactivated Amazon Web Services STS
                            for  a  region,  you need to reactivate Amazon Web
                            Services STS for that region.  For  more  informa-

                            WARNING:
                               If you use a built-in  algorithm  to  create  a
                               model, SageMaker requires that you provide a S3
                               path to the model artifacts in ModelDataUrl .

                        Environment -> (map)
                            The environment variables to  set  in  the  Docker
                            container.  Each  key and value in the Environment
                            string to string map can  have  length  of  up  to
                            1024. We support up to 16 entries in the map.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (string)

                        ModelPackageName -> (string)
                            The  name  or  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                            model package to use to create the model.

                        InferenceSpecificationName -> (string)
                            The inference  specification  name  in  the  model
                            package version.

                        MultiModelConfig -> (structure)
                            Specifies additional configuration for multi-model
                            endpoints.

                            ModelCacheSetting -> (string)
                               Whether to cache models for a multi-model  end-
                               point.  By default, multi-model endpoints cache
                               models so that a model  does  not  have  to  be
                               loaded  into  memory  each  time it is invoked.
                               Some  use  cases  do  not  benefit  from  model
                               caching.  For  example,  if an endpoint hosts a
                               large number of models that  are  each  invoked
                               infrequently, the endpoint might perform better
                               if you disable model caching. To disable  model
                               caching,  set  the  value  of this parameter to
                               Disabled .

                        ModelDataSource -> (structure)
                            Specifies the location of ML model data to deploy.

                            NOTE:
                               Currently you  cannot  use  ModelDataSource  in
                               conjunction  with  SageMaker  batch  transform,
                               SageMaker   serverless   endpoints,   SageMaker
                               multi-model  endpoints,  and  SageMaker Market-

                            S3DataSource -> (structure)
                               Specifies the S3 location of ML model  data  to
                               deploy.

                               S3Uri -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the  S3 path of ML model data to
                                   deploy.

                               S3DataType -> (string)
                                   Specifies the type of ML model data to  de-
                                   ploy.

                                   If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                                   key name prefix. SageMaker uses all objects
                                   that match the specified key name prefix as
                                   part of the ML  model  data  to  deploy.  A
                                   valid  key  name prefix identified by S3Uri
                                   always ends with a forward slash (/).

                                   If you choose S3Object ,  S3Uri  identifies
                                   an  object that is the ML model data to de-
                                   ploy.

                               CompressionType -> (string)
                                   Specifies how the ML  model  data  is  pre-
                                   pared.

                                   If  you  choose Gzip and choose S3Object as
                                   the value of S3DataType , S3Uri  identifies
                                   an object that is a gzip-compressed TAR ar-
                                   chive. SageMaker will attempt to decompress
                                   and  untar  the object during model deploy-
                                   ment.

                                   If you choose None and chooose S3Object  as
                                   the  value of S3DataType , S3Uri identifies
                                   an object that represents  an  uncompressed
                                   ML model to deploy.

                                   If  you  choose None and choose S3Prefix as
                                   the value of S3DataType , S3Uri  identifies
                                   a  key name prefix, under which all objects
                                   represents the uncompressed ML model to de-
                                   ploy.

                                   If  you  choose  None,  then SageMaker will
                                   follow rules below when creating model data
                                   files under /opt/ml/model directory for use
                                   by your inference code:

                                   o If you choose S3Object as  the  value  of
                                     S3DataType  ,  then  SageMaker will split
                                     the key of the S3  object  referenced  by
                                     S3Uri by slash (/), and use the last part
                                     as the filename of the file  holding  the
                                     content of the S3 object.

                                   o If  you  choose  S3Prefix as the value of
                                     S3DataType , then for each S3 object  un-
                                     der  the  key  name  pefix  referenced by
                                     S3Uri , SageMaker will trim  its  key  by
                                     the  prefix, and use the remainder as the
                                     path (relative to /opt/ml/model ) of  the
                                     file  holding  the  content of the S3 ob-
                                     ject. SageMaker will split the  remainder
                                     by slash (/), using intermediate parts as
                                     directory names  and  the  last  part  as
                                     filename  of the file holding the content
                                     of the S3 object.

                                   o Do not use any of the following  as  file
                                     names or directory names:

                                     o An empty or blank string

                                     o A string which contains null bytes

                                     o A string longer than 255 bytes

                                     o A single dot (. )

                                     o A double dot (.. )

                                   o Ambiguous file names will result in model
                                     deployment failure. For example, if  your
                                     uncompressed  ML model consists of two S3
                                     objects  s3://mybucket/model/weights  and
                                     s3://mybucket/model/weights/part1 and you
                                     specify s3://mybucket/model/ as the value
                                     of  S3Uri  and  S3Prefix  as the value of
                                     S3DataType , then it will result in  name
                                     clash  between  /opt/ml/model/weights  (a
                                     regular file) and  /opt/ml/model/weights/
                                     (a directory).

                                   o Do not organize the model artifacts in S3
                                     console using folders . When you create a
                                     folder in S3 console, S3 creates a 0-byte
                                     object with a key set to the folder  name
                                     you  provide.  They key of the 0-byte ob-
                                     ject ends with a slash (/) which violates
                                     SageMaker  restrictions on model artifact
                                     file names, leading to  model  deployment
                                     failure.

                     Containers -> (list)
                        The containers in the inference pipeline.

                        (structure)
                            Describes  the container, as part of model defini-
                            tion.

                            ContainerHostname -> (string)
                               This parameter is ignored for models that  con-
                               tain only a PrimaryContainer .

                               When a ContainerDefinition is part of an infer-
                               ence  pipeline,  the  value  of  the  parameter
                               uniquely  identifies the container for the pur-
                               poses of logging and metrics. For  information,
                               see  Use  Logs and Metrics to Monitor an Infer-
                               ence Pipeline . If you don't  specify  a  value
                               for  this  parameter  for a ContainerDefinition
                               that is part of an inference pipeline, a unique
                               name is automatically assigned based on the po-

                               every ContainerDefinition in that pipeline.

                            Image -> (string)
                               The  path  where inference code is stored. This
                               can be either in Amazon EC2 Container  Registry
                               or in a Docker registry that is accessible from
                               the same VPC that you configure for  your  end-
                               point.  If  you are using your own custom algo-
                               rithm instead of an algorithm provided by Sage-
                               Maker,  the  inference code must meet SageMaker
                               requirements.  SageMaker  supports  both   reg-
                               istry/repository[:tag]   and   registry/reposi-
                               tory[@digest] image path formats. For more  in-

                            MultiModelConfig -> (structure)
                               Specifies    additional    configuration    for
                               multi-model endpoints.

                               ModelCacheSetting -> (string)
                                   Whether  to  cache models for a multi-model
                                   endpoint. By default, multi-model endpoints
                                   cache  models so that a model does not have
                                   to be loaded into memory each  time  it  is
                                   invoked. Some use cases do not benefit from
                                   model caching. For example, if an  endpoint
                                   hosts  a  large  number  of models that are
                                   each  invoked  infrequently,  the  endpoint
                                   might  perform  better if you disable model
                                   caching. To disable model caching, set  the
                                   value of this parameter to Disabled .

                               NOTE:
                                   Currently you cannot use ModelDataSource in

                                      pressed  TAR archive. SageMaker will at-
                                      tempt to decompress and untar the object
                                      during model deployment.

                                      If  you choose None and chooose S3Object
                                      as the value of S3DataType , S3Uri iden-
                                      tifies  an object that represents an un-
                                      compressed ML model to deploy.

                                      If you choose None and  choose  S3Prefix
                                      as the value of S3DataType , S3Uri iden-
                                      tifies a key name  prefix,  under  which
                                      all  objects represents the uncompressed

                                        S3Uri by slash (/), and use  the  last
                                        part as the filename of the file hold-
                                        ing the content of the S3 object.

                                        S3DataType  ,  then for each S3 object
                                        under the key name pefix referenced by
                                        S3Uri , SageMaker will trim its key by
                                        the prefix, and use the  remainder  as
                                        the  path (relative to /opt/ml/model )
                                        of the file holding the content of the
                                        S3  object.  SageMaker  will split the
                                        remainder by slash (/), using interme-
                                        diate parts as directory names and the
                                        last part  as  filename  of  the  file
                                        holding the content of the S3 object.

                                      o Do  not  use  any  of the following as
                                        file names or directory names:

                                        o An empty or blank string

                                        o A string which contains null bytes

                                        o A string longer than 255 bytes

                                        o A single dot (. )

                                        o A double dot (.. )

                                      o Ambiguous file names  will  result  in
                                        model deployment failure. For example,
                                        if your uncompressed ML model consists
                                        of    two    S3    objects    s3://my-
                                        bucket/model/weights   and    s3://my-
                                        bucket/model/weights/part1   and   you
                                        specify  s3://mybucket/model/  as  the
                                        value  of  S3Uri  and  S3Prefix as the
                                        value of S3DataType , then it will re-
                                        sult    in    name    clash    between
                                        /opt/ml/model/weights (a regular file)
                                        and  /opt/ml/model/weights/  (a direc-
                                        tory).

                                      o Do not organize the model artifacts in
                                        S3  console  using  folders . When you
                                        create a folder in S3 console, S3 cre-
                                        ates a 0-byte object with a key set to
                                        the folder name you provide. They  key
                                        of the 0-byte object ends with a slash
                                        (/) which violates SageMaker  restric-
                                        tions  on  model  artifact file names,
                                        leading to model deployment failure.

                            tus NOT_APPLICABLE means that SageMaker is  unable
                            to  provide a default recommendation for the model
                            using the information provided. If the  deployment
                            status  is IN_PROGRESS , retry your API call after

                                   Inference.

                               Environment -> (map)
                                   The recommended  environment  variables  to
                                   set  in  the  model container for Real-Time
                                   Inference.

                                   value -> (string)

                 Endpoints -> (list)
                     The endpoints that host a model.

                     (structure)
                        An endpoint that hosts a model displayed in the Amazon
                        SageMaker Model Dashboard.

                        EndpointName -> (string)
                            The endpoint name.

                        EndpointArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint.

                        CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                            A  timestamp  that indicates when the endpoint was

                        EndpointStatus -> (string)
                            The endpoint status.

                 LastBatchTransformJob -> (structure)
                     A batch transform job. For  information  about  SageMaker
                     batch transform, see Use Batch Transform .

                     TransformJobName -> (string)
                        The name of the transform job.

                     TransformJobArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the transform job.

                     TransformJobStatus -> (string)
                        The status of the transform job.

                        Transform job statuses are:

                        o InProgress - The job is in progress.

                        o Completed - The job has completed.

                        o Failed  -  The  transform job has failed. To see the
                          reason for the failure, see the FailureReason  field
                          in the response to a DescribeTransformJob call.

                        o Stopping - The transform job is stopping.

                        o Stopped - The transform job has stopped.

                     FailureReason -> (string)
                        If the transform job failed, the reason it failed.

                     ModelName -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the model associated with the transform
                        job.

                     MaxConcurrentTransforms -> (integer)
                        The maximum number of parallel requests  that  can  be
                        sent  to  each instance in a transform job. If MaxCon-
                        currentTransforms is set to 0 or left unset, SageMaker
                        checks  the optional execution-parameters to determine
                        the settings for your chosen algorithm. If the  execu-
                        tion-parameters  endpoint  is not enabled, the default
                        value is 1. For built-in algorithms, you don't need to
                        set a value for MaxConcurrentTransforms .

                     ModelClientConfig -> (structure)
                        Configures  the  timeout and maximum number of retries
                        for processing a transform job invocation.

                        InvocationsTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The timeout value in seconds for an invocation re-
                            quest. The default value is 600.

                        InvocationsMaxRetries -> (integer)
                            The  maximum number of retries when invocation re-
                            quests are failing. The default value is 3.

                     MaxPayloadInMB -> (integer)
                        The maximum allowed size of the payload, in MB. A pay-
                        load  is  the  data portion of a record (without meta-
                        data). The value in  MaxPayloadInMB  must  be  greater
                        than, or equal to, the size of a single record. To es-
                        timate the size of a record in MB, divide the size  of
                        your  dataset by the number of records. To ensure that
                        the records fit within the maximum  payload  size,  we
                        recommend  using  a slightly larger value. The default
                        value is 6 MB. For cases where the  payload  might  be
                        arbitrarily  large and is transmitted using HTTP chun-
                        ked encoding, set the value to 0. This  feature  works
                        only  in  supported  algorithms.  Currently, SageMaker
                        built-in algorithms do not support HTTP chunked encod-
                        ing.

                     BatchStrategy -> (string)
                        Specifies  the  number  of  records  to  include  in a
                        mini-batch for an HTTP inference request. A record  is
                        a single unit of input data that inference can be made
                        on. For example, a single line in  a  CSV  file  is  a
                        record.

                     Environment -> (map)
                        The  environment  variables  to set in the Docker con-
                        tainer. We support up to 16 key and values entries  in
                        the map.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     TransformInput -> (structure)
                        Describes  the input source of a transform job and the
                        way the transform job consumes it.

                        DataSource -> (structure)
                            Describes the location of the channel data,  which
                            is,  the  S3  location  of the input data that the
                            model can consume.

                            S3DataSource -> (structure)
                               The S3 location of the data source that is  as-
                               sociated with a channel.

                               S3DataType -> (string)
                                   If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                                   key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses  all
                                   objects  with the specified key name prefix
                                   for batch transform.

                                   If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri  identi-
                                   fies an object that is a manifest file con-
                                   taining a list of object keys that you want
                                   Amazon  SageMaker  to  use for batch trans-
                                   form.

                               S3Uri -> (string)
                                   Depending on the value  specified  for  the
                                   S3DataType  ,  identifies either a key name
                                   prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                   o A key name prefix might look  like  this:
                                     s3://bucketname/exampleprefix .

                                   o A   manifest   might   look   like  this:
                                     s3://bucketname/example.manifest      The
                                     manifest  is an S3 object which is a JSON
                                     file  with  the  following  format:     [
                                     {"prefix":                     "s3://cus-

                                     tive/path/custdata-N"     ]   The preced-
                                     ing JSON matches the following  S3Uris  :

                                     tive/path/custdata-N   The  complete  set
                                     of  S3Uris  in  this manifest constitutes
                                     the input data for the channel  for  this
                                     datasource.  The  object that each S3Uris
                                     points to must be  readable  by  the  IAM
                                     role  that  Amazon SageMaker uses to per-
                                     form tasks on your behalf.

                        ContentType -> (string)
                            The multipurpose internet  mail  extension  (MIME)
                            type  of  the data. Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME
                            type with each http call to transfer data  to  the
                            transform job.

                        CompressionType -> (string)
                            If  your transform data is compressed, specify the
                            compression type. Amazon  SageMaker  automatically
                            decompresses  the  data  for the transform job ac-
                            cordingly. The default value is None .

                        SplitType -> (string)
                            The method to use to  split  the  transform  job's
                            data files into smaller batches. Splitting is nec-
                            essary when the total size of each object  is  too
                            large to fit in a single request. You can also use
                            data splitting to improve performance by  process-
                            ing  multiple concurrent mini-batches. The default
                            value for SplitType is None , which indicates that
                            input  data  files are not split, and request pay-
                            loads contain the entire contents of an input  ob-
                            ject.  Set  the value of this parameter to Line to
                            split records on  a  newline  character  boundary.
                            SplitType  also  supports  a number of record-ori-
                            ented binary data  formats.  Currently,  the  sup-
                            ported record formats are:

                            o RecordIO

                            o TFRecord

                            When   splitting   is   enabled,  the  size  of  a
                            mini-batch depends on the  values  of  the  Batch-
                            Strategy  and  MaxPayloadInMB parameters. When the
                            value of BatchStrategy  is  MultiRecord  ,  Amazon
                            SageMaker  sends  the maximum number of records in
                            each request, up to the MaxPayloadInMB  limit.  If
                            the  value of BatchStrategy is SingleRecord , Ama-
                            zon SageMaker sends individual records in each re-
                            quest.

                            NOTE:
                               Some  data  formats represent a record as a bi-
                               nary payload wrapped with extra padding  bytes.
                               When splitting is applied to a binary data for-
                               mat, padding is removed if the value of  Batch-
                               Strategy  is  set  to SingleRecord . Padding is
                               not removed if the value  of  BatchStrategy  is
                               set to MultiRecord .

                     TransformOutput -> (structure)
                        Describes the results of a transform job.

                        S3OutputPath -> (string)
                            The Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon SageMaker
                            to store the results of the transform job. For ex-
                            ample, s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                            For  every  S3 object used as input for the trans-
                            form job, batch transform stores  the  transformed
                            data  with  an  .``out`` suffix in a corresponding
                            subfolder in the location in  the  output  prefix.
                            For   example,   for  the  input  data  stored  at
                            s3://bucket-name/input-name-pre-
                            fix/dataset01/data.csv  ,  batch  transform stores
                            the  transformed  data  at   s3://bucket-name/out-
                            put-name-prefix/input-name-prefix/data.csv.out   .
                            Batch transform doesn't upload partially processed
                            objects. For an input S3 object that contains mul-
                            tiple records, it creates an .``out`` file only if
                            the  transform  job  succeeds  on the entire file.
                            When the input contains multiple S3  objects,  the
                            batch  transform  job  processes the listed S3 ob-
                            jects and uploads only the output for successfully
                            processed  objects.  If  any  object  fails in the
                            transform job batch transform  marks  the  job  as
                            failed to prompt investigation.

                        Accept -> (string)
                            The  MIME  type  used  to specify the output data.
                            Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME type with each http
                            call to transfer data from the transform job.

                        AssembleWith -> (string)
                            Defines  how to assemble the results of the trans-
                            form job as a single S3 object.  Choose  a  format
                            that is most convenient to you. To concatenate the
                            results in binary format, specify None . To add  a
                            newline  character at the end of every transformed
                            record, specify Line .

                        KmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The Amazon Web  Services  Key  Management  Service
                            (Amazon  Web  Services  KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                            Maker uses to encrypt the model artifacts at  rest
                            using   Amazon   S3  server-side  encryption.  The
                            KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

                            o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                            o Key                                         ARN:
                              arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                            o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

                            o Alias                 name                  ARN:

                              pleAlias

                            If you don't provide a KMS key  ID,  Amazon  Sage-
                            Maker  uses  the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for
                            your role's account.  For  more  information,  see

                            The KMS key policy must grant  permission  to  the
                            IAM  role that you specify in your CreateModel re-

                     TransformResources -> (structure)
                        Describes the resources, including ML  instance  types
                        and ML instance count, to use for transform job.

                        InstanceType -> (string)
                            The  ML  compute  instance  type for the transform
                            job. If  you  are  using  built-in  algorithms  to
                            transform  moderately sized datasets, we recommend
                            using ml.m4.xlarge or ml.m5.large instance types.

                        InstanceCount -> (integer)
                            The number of ML compute instances to use  in  the
                            transform  job.  The  default value is 1 , and the
                            maximum is 100 . For distributed  transform  jobs,
                            specify a value greater than 1 .

                        VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Web  Services  Key Management Service
                            (Amazon Web Services KMS) key  that  Amazon  Sage-
                            Maker  uses  to  encrypt model data on the storage
                            volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that
                            run the batch transform job.

                            NOTE:
                               Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include  local
                               storage, dependent on the instance type.  Local

                              pleAlias

                     CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                        A timestamp that shows when the transform Job was cre-
                        ated.

                     TransformStartTime -> (timestamp)
                        Indicates  when  the  transform  job  starts on ML in-
                        stances. You are billed for the time interval  between
                        this time and the value of TransformEndTime .

                     TransformEndTime -> (timestamp)
                        Indicates  when  the transform job has been completed,
                        or has stopped or failed. You are billed for the  time
                        interval between this time and the value of Transform-
                        StartTime .

                     LabelingJobArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  labeling  job
                        that created the transform job.

                     AutoMLJobArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AutoML job that
                        created the transform job.

                     DataProcessing -> (structure)
                        The data structure used to specify the data to be used
                        for  inference  in  a batch transform job and to asso-
                        ciate the data that is relevant to the prediction  re-
                        sults  in the output. The input filter provided allows
                        you to exclude input data that is not needed  for  in-
                        ference  in  a  batch transform job. The output filter
                        provided allows you to include input data relevant  to
                        interpreting  the  predictions  in the output from the
                        job. For more information,  see  Associate  Prediction
                        Results with their Corresponding Input Records .

                        InputFilter -> (string)
                            A  JSONPath expression used to select a portion of
                            the input data to pass to the algorithm.  Use  the
                            InputFilter  parameter  to exclude fields, such as
                            an ID column, from the input. If  you  want  Sage-
                            Maker  to pass the entire input dataset to the al-
                            gorithm, accept the default value $ .

                            Examples: "$" , "$[1:]" , "$.features"

                        OutputFilter -> (string)
                            A JSONPath expression used to select a portion  of
                            the  joined dataset to save in the output file for
                            a batch transform job. If you  want  SageMaker  to
                            store the entire input dataset in the output file,
                            leave the default value, $ . If  you  specify  in-
                            dexes that aren't within the dimension size of the
                            joined dataset, you get an error.

                            Examples: "$" , "$[0,5:]" , "$['id','SageMakerOut-
                            put']"

                        JoinSource -> (string)
                            Specifies  the source of the data to join with the
                            transformed data. The valid values  are  None  and
                            Input  .  The default value is None , which speci-
                            fies not to join the input  with  the  transformed
                            data.  If you want the batch transform job to join
                            the original input data with the transformed data,
                            set  JoinSource to Input . You can specify Output-
                            Filter as an additional filter to select a portion
                            of  the  joined dataset and store it in the output
                            file.

                            For JSON or JSONLines objects, such as a JSON  ar-
                            ray,  SageMaker  adds  the transformed data to the
                            input JSON object in  an  attribute  called  Sage-
                            MakerOutput . The joined result for JSON must be a
                            key-value pair object.  If  the  input  is  not  a
                            key-value  pair  object,  SageMaker  creates a new
                            JSON file. In the new JSON  file,  and  the  input
                            data  is  stored  under the SageMakerInput key and
                            the results are stored in SageMakerOutput .

                            For CSV data, SageMaker takes each row as  a  JSON
                            array  and joins the transformed data with the in-
                            put by appending each transformed row to  the  end
                            of the input. The joined data has the original in-
                            put data followed by the transformed data and  the
                            output is a CSV file.

                                   o If you want to set the job to start every
                                     hour,  use the following:  Hourly: cron(0
                                     * ? * * *)

                                   o If you  want  to  start  the  job  daily:

                                   To support running every 6, 12  hours,  the
                                   following are also supported:
                                      cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)

                                   For  example,  the following are valid cron
                                   expressions:

                                   o Every 12  hours,  starting  at  5pm  UTC:
                                     cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)

                                   o Every  two  hours  starting  at midnight:
                                     cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)

                                   NOTE:

                                      o Even though the cron expression is set
                                        to  start  at 5PM UTC, note that there
                                        could be a delay of 0-20 minutes  from
                                        the  actual  requested time to run the
                                        execution.

                                      o We recommend that if you would like  a
                                        daily  schedule,  you  do  not provide
                                        this parameter. Amazon SageMaker  will
                                        pick a time for running every day.

                                   You can also specify the keyword NOW to run
                                   the monitoring job immediately,  one  time,
                                   without recurring.

                               DataAnalysisStartTime -> (string)
                                   Sets  the  start  time for a monitoring job
                                   window. Express this time as an  offset  to
                                   the times that you schedule your monitoring
                                   jobs to run. You schedule  monitoring  jobs
                                   with   the   ScheduleExpression  parameter.
                                   Specify this offset in  ISO  8601  duration
                                   format. For example, if you want to monitor
                                   the five hours of data in your dataset that
                                   precede  the  start of each monitoring job,
                                   you would specify: "-PT5H" .

                                   The start time that you  specify  must  not
                                   precede  the  end  time that you specify by
                                   more than 24 hours.  You  specify  the  end
                                   time  with  the DataAnalysisEndTime parame-
                                   ter.

                                   If you set ScheduleExpression to NOW , this
                                   parameter is required.

                               DataAnalysisEndTime -> (string)
                                   Sets the end time for a monitoring job win-
                                   dow. Express this time as an offset to  the
                                   times  that  you  schedule  your monitoring
                                   jobs to run. You schedule  monitoring  jobs
                                   with   the   ScheduleExpression  parameter.
                                   Specify this offset in  ISO  8601  duration
                                   format. For example, if you want to end the
                                   window one hour before the  start  of  each
                                   monitoring  job, you would specify: "-PT1H"
                                   .

                                   The end time that you specify must not fol-
                                   low the start time that you specify by more
                                   than 24 hours. You specify the  start  time
                                   with the DataAnalysisStartTime parameter.

                                   If you set ScheduleExpression to NOW , this
                                   parameter is required.
