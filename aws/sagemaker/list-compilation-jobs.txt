LIST-COMPILATION-JOBS()                                LIST-COMPILATION-JOBS()



NAME
       list-compilation-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists model compilation jobs that satisfy various filters.

       To  create  a  model compilation job, use CreateCompilationJob . To get
       information about a particular model compilation job you have  created,
       use DescribeCompilationJob .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-compilation-jobs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: CompilationJobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns the model compilation jobs that  were  created
          after a specified time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns the model compilation jobs that were created
          before a specified time.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns the model compilation jobs that were  modified
          after a specified time.

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns the model compilation jobs that were modified
          before a specified time.

       --name-contains (string)
          A filter that returns the model compilation jobs whose name contains
          a specified string.

       --status-equals (string)
          A  filter that retrieves model compilation jobs with a specific Com-
          pilationJobStatus status.

          Possible values:

          o INPROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

          o STARTING

          o STOPPING

          o STOPPED

       --sort-by (string)
          The field by which to sort results. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
