OPTIONS
       --model-package-arn-list (list)
          The list of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model package groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                            If you are using your own custom algorithm instead
                            of an algorithm provided by SageMaker, the  infer-
                            ence  code must meet SageMaker requirements. Sage-
                            Maker supports both registry/repository[:tag]  and
                            registry/repository[@digest]  image  path formats.

                            fies the Docker image used for training.

                        ModelDataUrl -> (string)
                            The Amazon S3  path  where  the  model  artifacts,
                            which result from model training, are stored. This
                            path must point to a single  gzip  compressed  tar
                            archive (.tar.gz suffix).

                            NOTE:
                               The  model  artifacts  must  be in an S3 bucket
                               that is in the same region as the  model  pack-
                               age.

                        ModelDataSource -> (structure)
                            Specifies  the location of ML model data to deploy
                            during endpoint creation.

                            S3DataSource -> (structure)
                               Specifies the S3 location of ML model  data  to
                               deploy.

                               S3Uri -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the  S3 path of ML model data to
                                   deploy.

                               S3DataType -> (string)
                                   Specifies the type of ML model data to  de-
                                   ploy.

                                   If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                                   key name prefix. SageMaker uses all objects
                                   that match the specified key name prefix as
                                   part of the ML  model  data  to  deploy.  A
                                   valid  key  name prefix identified by S3Uri
                                   always ends with a forward slash (/).

                                   If you choose S3Object ,  S3Uri  identifies
                                   an  object that is the ML model data to de-
                                   ploy.

                               CompressionType -> (string)
                                   Specifies how the ML  model  data  is  pre-
                                   pared.

                                   If  you  choose Gzip and choose S3Object as
                                   the value of S3DataType , S3Uri  identifies
                                   an object that is a gzip-compressed TAR ar-
                                   chive. SageMaker will attempt to decompress
                                   and  untar  the object during model deploy-
                                   ment.

                                   If you choose None and chooose S3Object  as
                                   the  value of S3DataType , S3Uri identifies
                                   an object that represents  an  uncompressed
                                   ML model to deploy.

                                   If  you  choose None and choose S3Prefix as
                                   the value of S3DataType , S3Uri  identifies
                                   a  key name prefix, under which all objects
                                   represents the uncompressed ML model to de-
                                   ploy.

                                   If  you  choose  None,  then SageMaker will
                                   follow rules below when creating model data
                                   files under /opt/ml/model directory for use
                                   by your inference code:

                                   o If you choose S3Object as  the  value  of
                                     S3DataType  ,  then  SageMaker will split
                                     the key of the S3  object  referenced  by
                                     S3Uri by slash (/), and use the last part
                                     as the filename of the file  holding  the
                                     content of the S3 object.

                                   o If  you  choose  S3Prefix as the value of
                                     S3DataType , then for each S3 object  un-
                                     der  the  key  name  pefix  referenced by
                                     S3Uri , SageMaker will trim  its  key  by
                                     the  prefix, and use the remainder as the
                                     path (relative to /opt/ml/model ) of  the
                                     file  holding  the  content of the S3 ob-
                                     ject. SageMaker will split the  remainder
                                     by slash (/), using intermediate parts as
                                     directory names  and  the  last  part  as
                                     filename  of the file holding the content
                                     of the S3 object.

                                   o Do not use any of the following  as  file
                                     names or directory names:

                                     o An empty or blank string

                                     o A string which contains null bytes

                                     o A string longer than 255 bytes

                                     o A single dot (. )

                                     o A double dot (.. )

                                   o Ambiguous file names will result in model
                                     deployment failure. For example, if  your
                                     uncompressed  ML model consists of two S3
                                     objects  s3://mybucket/model/weights  and
                                     s3://mybucket/model/weights/part1 and you
                                     specify s3://mybucket/model/ as the value
                                     of  S3Uri  and  S3Prefix  as the value of
                                     S3DataType , then it will result in  name
                                     clash  between  /opt/ml/model/weights  (a
                                     regular file) and  /opt/ml/model/weights/
                                     (a directory).

                                   o Do not organize the model artifacts in S3
                                     console using folders . When you create a
                                     folder in S3 console, S3 creates a 0-byte
                                     object with a key set to the folder  name
                                     you  provide.  They key of the 0-byte ob-
                                     ject ends with a slash (/) which violates
                                     SageMaker  restrictions on model artifact
                                     file names, leading to  model  deployment
                                     failure.

                               ModelAccessConfig -> (structure)
                                   Specifies the access configuration file for
                                   the ML model. You can explicitly accept the
                                   model  end-user  license  agreement  (EULA)
                                   within the ModelAccessConfig . You are  re-
                                   sponsible  for reviewing and complying with
                                   any applicable  license  terms  and  making
                                   sure  they are acceptable for your use case
                                   before downloading or using a model.

                                   AcceptEula -> (boolean)
                                      Specifies   agreement   to   the   model
                                      end-user  license  agreement (EULA). The
                                      AcceptEula value must be explicitly  de-
                                      fined  as  True  in  order to accept the
                                      EULA that this model requires.  You  are
                                      responsible  for reviewing and complying
                                      with any applicable  license  terms  and
                                      making sure they are acceptable for your
                                      use case before downloading or  using  a
                                      model.

                        ProductId -> (string)
                            The  Amazon Web Services Marketplace product ID of
                            the model package.

                        Environment -> (map)
                            The environment variables to  set  in  the  Docker
                            container.  Each  key and value in the Environment
