STOP-PIPELINE-EXECUTION()                            STOP-PIPELINE-EXECUTION()



NAME
       stop-pipeline-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops a pipeline execution.
          Callback Step

       A  pipeline execution won't stop while a callback step is running. When
       you call StopPipelineExecution on a pipeline execution with  a  running
       callback  step, SageMaker Pipelines sends an additional Amazon SQS mes-
       sage to the specified SQS queue. The body of the SQS message contains a
       "Status" field which is set to "Stopping".

       You  should  add  logic to your Amazon SQS message consumer to take any
       needed action (for example, resource cleanup) upon receipt of the  mes-
       sage  followed  by  a call to SendPipelineExecutionStepSuccess or Send-
       PipelineExecutionStepFailure .

       Only when SageMaker Pipelines receives one of these calls will it  stop
       the pipeline execution.
          Lambda Step

       A  pipeline  execution  can't be stopped while a lambda step is running
       because the Lambda  function  invoked  by  the  lambda  step  can't  be
       stopped. If you attempt to stop the execution while the Lambda function
       is running, the pipeline waits for the Lambda function to finish or un-
       til  the timeout is hit, whichever occurs first, and then stops. If the
       Lambda function finishes, the pipeline execution status is Stopped . If
       the timeout is hit the pipeline execution status is Failed .

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline execution.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the operation. An idempotent operation  completes  no
          more than once.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       PipelineExecutionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline execution.
