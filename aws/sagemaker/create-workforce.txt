CREATE-WORKFORCE()                                          CREATE-WORKFORCE()



NAME
       create-workforce -

DESCRIPTION
       Use this operation to create a workforce. This operation will return an
       error if a workforce already exists in the Amazon Web  Services  Region
       that  you specify. You can only create one workforce in each Amazon Web
       Services Region per Amazon Web Services account.

       If you want to create a new workforce in an Amazon Web Services  Region
       where a workforce already exists, use the DeleteWorkforce API operation
       to delete the existing workforce and then use CreateWorkforce to create
       a new workforce.

       To  create a private workforce using Amazon Cognito, you must specify a
       Cognito user pool in CognitoConfig . You can also create an Amazon Cog-
       nito  workforce  using  the Amazon SageMaker console. For more informa-
       tion, see Create a Private Workforce (Amazon Cognito) .

       To create a private workforce using your  own  OIDC  Identity  Provider
       (IdP),  specify  your  IdP  configuration in OidcConfig . Your OIDC IdP
       must support groups because groups are used by Ground Truth and  Amazon
       A2I  to  create  work teams. For more information, see Create a Private
       Workforce (OIDC IdP) .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-

       the string will be taken literally.

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
