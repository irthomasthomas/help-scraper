NAME
       delete-feature-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete  the  FeatureGroup  and any data that was written to the Online-
       Store of the FeatureGroup . Data cannot be accessed  from  the  Online-
       Store immediately after DeleteFeatureGroup is called.

       Data  written into the OfflineStore will not be deleted. The Amazon Web
       Services Glue database and tables that are  automatically  created  for
       your OfflineStore are not deleted.

       Note  that it can take approximately 10-15 minutes to delete an Online-
       Store  FeatureGroup with the InMemory  StorageType .

OPTIONS
       --feature-group-name (string)
          The name of the FeatureGroup you want to delete. The  name  must  be
          unique  within  an  Amazon Web Services Region in an Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
