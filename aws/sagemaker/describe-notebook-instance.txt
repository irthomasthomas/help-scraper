OPTIONS
       --notebook-instance-name (string)
          The name of the notebook instance that you want information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          For  information  about  notebook instance lifestyle configurations,
          see Step 2.1: (Optional) Customize a Notebook Instance

       DirectInternetAccess -> (string)
          Describes whether SageMaker provides internet access to the notebook
          instance.  If  this value is set to Disabled , the notebook instance
          does not have internet  access,  and  cannot  connect  to  SageMaker
          training and endpoint services.

          For more information, see Notebook Instances Are Internet-Enabled by

       DefaultCodeRepository -> (string)
          The Git repository associated with the notebook instance as its  de-
          fault  code repository. This can be either the name of a Git reposi-
          tory stored as a resource in your account,  or  the  URL  of  a  Git
          repository  in  Amazon  Web  Services CodeCommit or in any other Git
          repository. When you open a notebook instance, it opens in  the  di-
          rectory  that  contains  this  repository. For more information, see
          Associating Git Repositories with SageMaker Notebook Instances .

       AdditionalCodeRepositories -> (list)
          An array of up to three Git repositories associated with  the  note-
          book  instance.  These  can  be either the names of Git repositories
          stored as resources in your account, or the URL of Git  repositories
          in  Amazon  Web  Services CodeCommit or in any other Git repository.
          These repositories are cloned at  the  same  level  as  the  default
          repository  of  your  notebook  instance.  For more information, see
          Associating Git Repositories with SageMaker Notebook Instances .

          (string)

       RootAccess -> (string)
          Whether root access is enabled or disabled for users of the notebook
          instance.

          NOTE:
              Lifecycle configurations need root access to be able to set up a
              notebook instance. Because of this, lifecycle configurations as-
              sociated  with  a  notebook instance always run with root access
              even if you disable root access for users.

       PlatformIdentifier -> (string)
          The platform identifier of the notebook  instance  runtime  environ-
          ment.

       InstanceMetadataServiceConfiguration -> (structure)
          Information on the IMDS configuration of the notebook instance

          MinimumInstanceMetadataServiceVersion -> (string)
              Indicates  the  minimum  IMDS version that the notebook instance
              supports. When passed as part of CreateNotebookInstance , if  no
              value  is  selected, then it defaults to IMDSv1. This means that
              both IMDSv1 and IMDSv2 are supported. If passed as part  of  Up-
              dateNotebookInstance , there is no default.
