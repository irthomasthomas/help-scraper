NAME
       create-notebook-instance-lifecycle-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  lifecycle configuration that you can associate with a note-
       book instance. A lifecycle  configuration  is  a  collection  of  shell
       scripts that run when you create or start a notebook instance.

       Each lifecycle configuration script has a limit of 16384 characters.

       The  value  of the $PATH environment variable that is available to both
       scripts is /sbin:bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin .

       View CloudWatch Logs for notebook instance lifecycle configurations  in
       log  group /aws/sagemaker/NotebookInstances in log stream [notebook-in-
       stance-name]/[LifecycleConfigHook] .

       Lifecycle configuration scripts cannot run for longer than  5  minutes.
       If  a  script runs for longer than 5 minutes, it fails and the notebook
       instance is not created or started.

OPTIONS
       --notebook-instance-lifecycle-config-name (string)
          The name of the lifecycle configuration.

       --on-create (list)
          A  shell  script that runs only once, when you create a notebook in-
          stance. The shell script must be a base64-encoded string.

          (structure)
              Contains the notebook instance lifecycle configuration script.

              Each lifecycle configuration script has a limit of 16384 charac-
              ters.

              both scripts is /sbin:bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin .

              Lifecycle configuration scripts cannot run  for  longer  than  5
              minutes.  If  a  script runs for longer than 5 minutes, it fails
              and the notebook instance is not created or started.

              Content -> (string)
                 A  base64-encoded  string  that contains a shell script for a
                 notebook instance lifecycle configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ]

       --on-start (list)
          A shell script that runs every time you start a  notebook  instance,
          including  when  you  create the notebook instance. The shell script
          must be a base64-encoded string.

          (structure)
              Contains the notebook instance lifecycle configuration script.

              Content -> (string)
                 A  base64-encoded  string  that contains a shell script for a
                 notebook instance lifecycle configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Content=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
