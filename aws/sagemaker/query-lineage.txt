OPTIONS
       --start-arns (list)
          A  list  of  resource  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that represent the
          starting point for your lineage query.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --direction (string)
          Associations between lineage entities have a direction. This parame-
          ter  determines  the  direction  from the StartArn(s) that the query
          traverses.

          Possible values:

          o Both

          o Ascendants

          o Descendants

       --include-edges | --no-include-edges (boolean)
          Setting this value to True retrieves not only the entities of inter-
          est  but also the Associations and lineage entities on the path. Set
          to False to only return lineage entities that match your query.

       --filters (structure)
          A set of filtering parameters that allow you to specify which  enti-
          ties should be returned.

          o Properties  -  Key-value  pairs  to match on the lineage entities'
            properties.

          o LineageTypes - A set of lineage entity types to match on. For  ex-
            ample: TrialComponent , Artifact , or Context .

          o CreatedBefore - Filter entities created before this date.

          o ModifiedBefore - Filter entities modified before this date.

          o ModifiedAfter - Filter entities modified after this date.

          Types -> (list)
              Filter  the  lineage entities connected to the StartArn by type.
              For example: DataSet , Model , Endpoint , or ModelDeployment .

              (string)

          LineageTypes -> (list)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s) by the
              type of the lineage entity.

              (string)

          CreatedBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filter  the  lineage  entities  connected to the StartArn (s) by
              created date.

          CreatedAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s)  after
              the create date.

          ModifiedBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s) before
              the last modified date.

          ModifiedAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s)  after
              the last modified date.

          Properties -> (map)
              Filter  the  lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s) by a
              set if property key value pairs. If multiple pairs are provided,
              an  entity  is  included in the results if it matches any of the
              provided pairs.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Types=string,string,LineageTypes=string,string,CreatedBefore=timestamp,CreatedAfter=timestamp,ModifiedBefore=timestamp,ModifiedAfter=timestamp,Properties={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Types": ["string", ...],
            "LineageTypes": ["TrialComponent"|"Artifact"|"Context"|"Action", ...],
            "CreatedBefore": timestamp,
            "CreatedAfter": timestamp,
            "ModifiedBefore": timestamp,
            "ModifiedAfter": timestamp,
            "Properties": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --max-depth (integer)
          The maximum depth in lineage relationships from the  StartArns  that
          are traversed. Depth is a measure of the number of Associations from
          the StartArn entity to the matched results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Limits the number of vertices in the results. Use the NextToken in a
          response to to retrieve the next page of results.

       --next-token (string)
          Limits the number of vertices in the request. Use the NextToken in a
          response to to retrieve the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

              SourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the source lineage entity
                 of the directed edge.
