CREATE-OPTIMIZATION-JOB()                            CREATE-OPTIMIZATION-JOB()



NAME
       create-optimization-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a job that optimizes a model for inference performance. To cre-
       ate the job, you provide the location of a source model, and  you  pro-
       vide the settings for the optimization techniques that you want the job
       to apply. When the job completes successfully,  SageMaker  uploads  the
       new optimized model to the output destination that you specify.

       For  more  information about how to use this action, and about the sup-
       ported optimization techniques, see Optimize model inference with  Ama-
       zon SageMaker .

OPTIONS
       --optimization-job-name (string)
          A custom name for the new optimization job.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of an IAM role that enables Amazon
          SageMaker to perform tasks on your behalf.

          During model optimization, Amazon SageMaker  needs  your  permission
          to:

          o Read input data from an S3 bucket

          o Write model artifacts to an S3 bucket

          o Write logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs

          o Publish metrics to Amazon CloudWatch

          You grant permissions for all of these tasks to an IAM role. To pass
          this role to Amazon SageMaker, the caller of this API must have  the
          iam:PassRole  permission. For more information, see Amazon SageMaker
          Roles.

                 An Amazon S3 URI that locates a source model to optimize with
                 an optimization job.

              ModelAccessConfig -> (structure)
                 The access configuration settings for the source ML model for
                 an optimization job, where you can accept the model  end-user
                 license agreement (EULA).

                 AcceptEula -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  agreement to the model end-user license agree-
                     ment (EULA). The AcceptEula value must be explicitly  de-
                     fined as True in order to accept the EULA that this model
                     requires. You are responsible for reviewing and complying
                     with  any  applicable  license terms and making sure they
                     are acceptable for your use case  before  downloading  or
                     using a model.

            ...
          ]

       --output-config (structure)
          Details  for where to store the optimized model that you create with
          the optimization job.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a key in Amazon  Web  Services
              KMS. SageMaker uses they key to encrypt the artifacts of the op-
              timized model when SageMaker uploads the model to Amazon S3.

          S3OutputLocation -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 URI for where to store the  optimized  model  that
              you create with an optimization job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KmsKeyId=string,S3OutputLocation=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KmsKeyId": "string",
            "S3OutputLocation": "string"
          }

       --stopping-condition (structure)
          Specifies  a  limit  to how long a job can run. When the job reaches
          the time limit, SageMaker ends the job. Use this API to cap costs.

          To stop a training job, SageMaker sends the  algorithm  the  SIGTERM
          signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can
          use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so  the  re-
          sults of training are not lost.

          The training algorithms provided by SageMaker automatically save the
          intermediate results of a model training job when possible. This at-
          tempt  to  save  artifacts is only a best effort case as model might
          not be in a state from which it can be saved. For example, if train-
          ing  has  just  started,  the model might not be ready to save. When
          saved, this intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use
          it to create a model with CreateModel .

          NOTE:
              The  Neural  Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving
              intermediate model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that
              the  maximum  runtime is sufficient for the training job to com-
              plete.

          MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The maximum length of time, in seconds, that a training or  com-
              pilation job can run before it is stopped.

              For  compilation  jobs, if the job does not complete during this
              time, a TimeOut error is generated. We recommend  starting  with
              900 seconds and increasing as necessary based on your model.

              For  all  other  jobs,  if the job does not complete during this
              time, SageMaker ends the job. When RetryStrategy is specified in
              the  job request, MaxRuntimeInSeconds specifies the maximum time
              for all of the attempts in total, not each  individual  attempt.
              The default value is 1 day. The maximum value is 28 days.

              The  maximum time that a TrainingJob can run in total, including
              any time spent publishing metrics  or  archiving  and  uploading
              models after it has been stopped, is 30 days.

          MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The  maximum  length  of  time,  in seconds, that a managed Spot
              training job has to complete. It is the  amount  of  time  spent
              waiting  for  Spot  capacity plus the amount of time the job can
              run. It must be equal to or greater than  MaxRuntimeInSeconds  .
              If  the  job  does not complete during this time, SageMaker ends
              the job.

              When RetryStrategy is specified in  the  job  request,  MaxWait-
              TimeInSeconds specifies the maximum time for all of the attempts
              in total, not each individual attempt.

          MaxPendingTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The maximum length of time, in seconds, that a training or  com-
              pilation job can be pending before it is stopped.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MaxRuntimeInSeconds=integer,MaxWaitTimeInSeconds=integer,MaxPendingTimeInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MaxRuntimeInSeconds": integer,
            "MaxWaitTimeInSeconds": integer,
            "MaxPendingTimeInSeconds": integer
          }

       --tags (list)
          A  list of key-value pairs associated with the optimization job. For
          more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services resources  in  the
          Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide .

          (structure)
              A  tag object that consists of a key and an optional value, used
              to manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

              You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs,  hyperpa-
              rameter  tuning  jobs,  batch  transform  jobs, models, labeling
              jobs, work teams, endpoint configurations,  and  endpoints.  For
              more  information  on  adding  tags  to SageMaker resources, see
              AddTags .

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
