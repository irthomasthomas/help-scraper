LIST-CLUSTERS()                                                LIST-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       list-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the list of SageMaker HyperPod clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-clusters  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ClusterSummaries

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          Set a start time for the time range during which you  want  to  list
          SageMaker  HyperPod  clusters. Timestamps are formatted according to
          the ISO 8601 standard.

          Acceptable formats include:

          o YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssTZD       (UTC),        for        example,
            2014-10-01T20:30:00.000Z

          o YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssTZD    (with    offset),    for    example,
            2014-10-01T12:30:00.000-08:00

          o YYYY-MM-DD , for example, 2014-10-01

          o Unix time in seconds, for example, 1412195400 . This is  also  re-
            ferred  to as Unix Epoch time and represents the number of seconds
            since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.

          For more information about the timestamp format,  see  Timestamp  in
          the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide .

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          Set  an  end  time  for the time range during which you want to list
          SageMaker HyperPod clusters. A filter that returns nodes in a  Sage-
          Maker  HyperPod  cluster  created before the specified time. The ac-
          ceptable formats are the same as the timestamp formats for Creation-
          TimeAfter  .  For  more  information about the timestamp format, see
          Timestamp in the Amazon Web Services  Command  Line  Interface  User
          Guide .

       --name-contains (string)
          Set the maximum number of instances to print in the list.

       --sort-by (string)
          The  field  by  which  to  sort  results.  The default value is CRE-
          ATION_TIME .

          Possible values:

          o CREATION_TIME

          o NAME

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default value is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --training-plan-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN); of the training plan to filter clus-
          ters  by. For more information about reserving GPU capacity for your
          SageMaker HyperPod clusters using Amazon  SageMaker  Training  Plan,
          see `` CreateTrainingPlan `` .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If the result of the previous ListClusters  request  was  truncated,
          the  response  includes  a  NextToken  . To retrieve the next set of
          clusters, use the token in the next request.

                 The name of the SageMaker HyperPod cluster.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the SageMaker HyperPod cluster is created.

              ClusterStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the SageMaker HyperPod cluster.

              TrainingPlanArns -> (list)
                 A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the training  plans
                 associated with this cluster.
