CREATE-PRESIGNED-DOMAIN-URL()                    CREATE-PRESIGNED-DOMAIN-URL()



NAME
       create-presigned-domain-url -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a URL for a specified UserProfile in a Domain. When accessed in
       a web browser, the user will be automatically signed in to the  domain,
       and granted access to all of the Apps and files associated with the Do-
       main's Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volume. This operation can only
       be called when the authentication mode equals IAM.

       The  IAM role or user passed to this API defines the permissions to ac-
       cess the app. Once the presigned URL is created, no additional  permis-
       sion  is  required  to  access this URL. IAM authorization policies for
       this API are also enforced for every HTTP request and  WebSocket  frame
       that attempts to connect to the app.

       You can restrict access to this API and to the URL that it returns to a
       list of IP addresses, Amazon VPCs or  Amazon  VPC  Endpoints  that  you
       specify.  For  more information, see Connect to Amazon SageMaker Studio
       Through an Interface VPC Endpoint .

       NOTE:
          The URL that you get from a call to CreatePresignedDomainUrl  has  a
          default timeout of 5 minutes. You can configure this value using Ex-
          piresInSeconds . If you try to use the URL after the  timeout  limit
          expires, you are directed to the Amazon Web Services console sign-in
          page.

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The domain ID.

       --user-profile-name (string)
          The name of the UserProfile to sign-in as.

       --session-expiration-duration-in-seconds (integer)
          The session expiration duration in seconds. This value  defaults  to
          43200.

       --expires-in-seconds (integer)
          The  number  of seconds until the pre-signed URL expires. This value
          defaults to 300.

       --space-name (string)
          The name of the space.

       --landing-uri (string)
          The landing page that the user is directed  to  when  accessing  the
          presigned  URL.  Using this value, users can access Studio or Studio
          Classic, even if it is not the default experience  for  the  domain.
          The supported values are:

          o studio::relative/path : Directs users to the relative path in Stu-
            dio.

          o app:JupyterServer:relative/path : Directs users  to  the  relative
            path in the Studio Classic application.

          o app:JupyterLab:relative/path  : Directs users to the relative path
            in the JupyterLab application.

          o app:RStudioServerPro:relative/path : Directs users to the relative
            path in the RStudio application.

          o app:CodeEditor:relative/path  : Directs users to the relative path
            in the Code Editor, based on Code-OSS, Visual Studio Code  -  Open
            Source application.

          o app:Canvas:relative/path  :  Directs users to the relative path in
            the Canvas application.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)
