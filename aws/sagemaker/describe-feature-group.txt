OPTIONS
       --feature-group-name (string)
          The  name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FeatureGroup you want
          described.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to resume pagination of the list of Features (FeatureDefini-
          tions ). 2,500 Features are returned by default.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

       ThroughputConfig -> (structure)
          Active throughput configuration of the feature group. There are  two
          modes:  ON_DEMAND  and  PROVISIONED  .  With on-demand mode, you are
          charged for data reads and writes that your application performs  on
          your  feature  group.  You  do  not  need  to specify read and write
          throughput because Feature Store accommodates your workloads as they
          ramp  up  and down. You can switch a feature group to on-demand only
          once in a 24 hour period.  With  provisioned  throughput  mode,  you
          specify  the read and write capacity per second that you expect your
          application to require, and you are billed based  on  those  limits.
          Exceeding  provisioned throughput will result in your requests being
          throttled.

          Note: PROVISIONED throughput mode  is  supported  only  for  feature
          groups    that   are   offline-only,   or   use   the   `   Standard
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_OnlineStoreConfig.html#sagemaker-Type-OnlineStoreConfig-StorageType`__
          tier online store.

          ThroughputMode -> (string)
              The  mode  used  for your feature group throughput: ON_DEMAND or
              PROVISIONED .

          ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              For provisioned feature groups with online store  enabled,  this
              indicates the read throughput you are billed for and can consume
              without throttling.

              This field is not applicable for on-demand feature groups.

          ProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              For  provisioned  feature  groups,  this  indicates  the   write
              throughput  you  are  billed  for and can consume without throt-
              tling.

              This field is not applicable for on-demand feature groups.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  execution  role  used  to
          persist  data into the OfflineStore if an OfflineStoreConfig is pro-
          vided.

       FeatureGroupStatus -> (string)
          The status of the feature group.

       OfflineStoreStatus -> (structure)
          The status of the OfflineStore . Notifies you  if  replicating  data
          into the OfflineStore has failed. Returns either: Active or Blocked

          Status -> (string)
              An OfflineStore status.

          BlockedReason -> (string)
              The  justification for why the OfflineStoreStatus is Blocked (if
              applicable).

       LastUpdateStatus -> (structure)
          A value indicating whether the update made to the feature group  was
          successful.

          Status -> (string)
              A value that indicates whether the update was made successful.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If  the  update  wasn't  successful, indicates the reason why it
              failed.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          The reason that the FeatureGroup failed to be replicated in the  Of-
          flineStore . This is failure can occur because:

          o The FeatureGroup could not be created in the OfflineStore .

          o The FeatureGroup could not be deleted from the OfflineStore .

       Description -> (string)
          A free form description of the feature group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token to resume pagination of the list of Features (FeatureDefini-
          tions ).
