                 stderr  or stdout . You can view these logs to understand how
                 your training job performs and check for any  errors  encoun-
                 tered  during  training. SageMaker hyperparameter tuning cap-
                 tures all defined metrics. Specify one of the defined metrics
                 to  use  as an objective metric using the TuningObjective pa-
                 rameter in  the  HyperParameterTrainingJobDefinition  API  to
                 evaluate job performance during hyperparameter tuning.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the metric.

                 Regex -> (string)
                     A regular expression that searches the output of a train-
                     ing job and gets the value of the metric. For more infor-
                     mation about using regular expressions to define metrics,
                     see Defining metrics and environment variables .

          TrainingChannels -> (list)
              A list of ChannelSpecification objects, which specify the  input
              sources to be used by the algorithm.

              (structure)
                 Defines a named input source, called a channel, to be used by
                 an algorithm.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the channel.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A brief description of the channel.

                 IsRequired -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the channel is required  by  the  algo-
                     rithm.

                     (string)

                 SupportedCompressionTypes -> (list)
                     The  allowed  compression  types,  if data compression is
                     used.

                     (string)

                 SupportedInputModes -> (list)
                     The allowed input mode, either FILE or PIPE.

                     In FILE mode, Amazon SageMaker copies the data  from  the
                     input  source  onto  the local Amazon Elastic Block Store
                     (Amazon EBS) volumes before starting your training  algo-
                     rithm. This is the most commonly used input mode.

                     In  PIPE  mode,  Amazon SageMaker streams input data from
                     the source directly to your algorithm without  using  the
                     EBS volume.

                     (string)
                        The  training  input mode that the algorithm supports.
                        For more information about input modes, see Algorithms
                        .
                            Pipe mode

                        If  an  algorithm supports Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker
                        streams data directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
                            File mode

                        If an algorithm supports File  mode,  SageMaker  down-
                        loads  the training data from S3 to the provisioned ML
                        storage volume, and mounts the directory to the Docker
                        volume for the training container.

                        You  must  provision the ML storage volume with suffi-
                        cient capacity to accommodate the data downloaded from
                        S3.  In  addition to the training data, the ML storage
                        volume also stores the  output  model.  The  algorithm
                        container uses the ML storage volume to also store in-
                        termediate information, if any.

                        For distributed algorithms, training data is  distrib-
                        uted  uniformly. Your training duration is predictable
                        if the input data objects sizes are approximately  the
                        same.  SageMaker  does not split the files any further
                        for model training. If the object  sizes  are  skewed,
                        training  won't be optimal as the data distribution is
                        also skewed when one host in  a  training  cluster  is
                        overloaded, thus becoming a bottleneck in training.
                            FastFile mode

                        If  an  algorithm  supports  FastFile  mode, SageMaker
                        streams data directly from S3 to the container with no
                        code  changes,  and provides file system access to the
                        data. Users can author their training script to inter-
                        act with these files as if they were stored on disk.
                            FastFile mode works best when the data is read se-
                            quentially. Augmented manifest files  aren't  sup-
                            ported.  The  startup time is lower when there are
                            fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

          SupportedTuningJobObjectiveMetrics -> (list)
              A list of the metrics that the algorithm emits that can be  used
              as the objective metric in a hyperparameter tuning job.

              (structure)
                 Defines the objective metric for a hyperparameter tuning job.
                 Hyperparameter tuning uses the value of this metric to evalu-
                 ate  the  training jobs it launches, and returns the training
                 job that results in either the highest or  lowest  value  for
                 this  metric, depending on the value you specify for the Type
                 parameter. If you want to define a custom  objective  metric,
                 see Define metrics and environment variables .

                 Type -> (string)
                     Whether to minimize or maximize the objective metric.

                 MetricName -> (string)
                     The name of the metric to use for the objective metric.

          AdditionalS3DataSource -> (structure)
              The additional data source used during the training job.

              S3DataType -> (string)
                 The  data type of the additional data source that you specify
                 for use in inference or training.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The uniform resource identifier (URI) used to identify an ad-
                 ditional data source used in inference or training.

              CompressionType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  compression used for an additional data source
                 used in inference or training. Specify  None  if  your  addi-
                 tional data source is not compressed.

              (structure)
                 Describes the Docker container for the model package.

                 ContainerHostname -> (string)
                     The DNS host name for the Docker container.

                 Image -> (string)
                     The Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR) path where
                     inference code is stored.

                     If  you are using your own custom algorithm instead of an
                     algorithm provided by SageMaker, the inference code  must
                     meet SageMaker requirements. SageMaker supports both reg-
                     istry/repository[:tag]  and  registry/repository[@digest]
                     image  path formats. For more information, see Using Your
                     Own Algorithms with Amazon SageMaker .

                 ImageDigest -> (string)
                     An MD5 hash of the training algorithm that identifies the
                     Docker image used for training.

                 ModelDataUrl -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  S3 path where the model artifacts, which re-
                     sult from model training,  are  stored.  This  path  must
                     point  to  a  single gzip compressed tar archive (.tar.gz
                     suffix).

                     NOTE:
                        The model artifacts must be in an S3 bucket that is in
                        the same region as the model package.

                 ModelDataSource -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the location of ML model data to deploy during
                     endpoint creation.

                     S3DataSource -> (structure)
                        Specifies the S3 location of ML model data to deploy.

                        S3Uri -> (string)
                            Specifies the S3 path of ML model data to deploy.

                        S3DataType -> (string)
                            Specifies the type of ML model data to deploy.

                            If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri  identifies  a  key
                            name prefix. SageMaker uses all objects that match
                            the specified key name prefix as part  of  the  ML
                            model  data  to  deploy.  A  valid key name prefix
                            identified by S3Uri always  ends  with  a  forward
                            slash (/).

                            If  you  choose S3Object , S3Uri identifies an ob-
                            ject that is the ML model data to deploy.

                        CompressionType -> (string)
                            Specifies how the ML model data is prepared.

                            If you choose Gzip  and  choose  S3Object  as  the
                            value  of  S3DataType , S3Uri identifies an object
                            that is a gzip-compressed TAR  archive.  SageMaker
                            will  attempt  to  decompress and untar the object
                            during model deployment.

                            If you choose None and  chooose  S3Object  as  the
                            value  of  S3DataType , S3Uri identifies an object
                            that represents an uncompressed ML  model  to  de-
                            ploy.

                            If  you  choose  None  and  choose S3Prefix as the
                            value of S3DataType , S3Uri identifies a key  name
                            prefix, under which all objects represents the un-
                            compressed ML model to deploy.

                            If you choose None,  then  SageMaker  will  follow
                            rules  below  when creating model data files under
                            /opt/ml/model directory for use by your  inference
                            code:

                            o If   you   choose   S3Object  as  the  value  of
                              S3DataType , then SageMaker will split  the  key
                              of  the  S3  object referenced by S3Uri by slash
                              (/), and use the last part as  the  filename  of
                              the file holding the content of the S3 object.

                            o If   you   choose   S3Prefix  as  the  value  of
                              S3DataType , then for each S3 object  under  the
                              key  name  pefix referenced by S3Uri , SageMaker
                              will trim its key by the prefix, and use the re-
                              mainder as the path (relative to /opt/ml/model )
                              of the file holding the content of  the  S3  ob-
                              ject.  SageMaker  will  split  the  remainder by
                              slash (/), using intermediate parts as directory
                              names  and the last part as filename of the file
                              holding the content of the S3 object.

                            o Do not use any of the following as file names or
                              directory names:

                              o An empty or blank string

                              o A string which contains null bytes

                              o A string longer than 255 bytes

                              o A single dot (. )

                              o A double dot (.. )

                            o Ambiguous  file  names  will result in model de-
                              ployment failure. For example,  if  your  uncom-
                              pressed  ML  model  consists  of  two S3 objects
                              s3://mybucket/model/weights     and     s3://my-
                              bucket/model/weights/part1   and   you   specify
                              s3://mybucket/model/ as the value of  S3Uri  and
                              S3Prefix  as  the  value of S3DataType , then it
                              will    result    in    name    clash    between
                              /opt/ml/model/weights   (a   regular  file)  and
                              /opt/ml/model/weights/ (a directory).

                            o Do not organize the model artifacts in  S3  con-
                              sole using folders . When you create a folder in
                              S3 console, S3 creates a 0-byte  object  with  a
                              key set to the folder name you provide. They key
                              of the 0-byte object ends with a slash (/) which
                              violates  SageMaker  restrictions on model arti-
                              fact file names,  leading  to  model  deployment
                              failure.

                        ModelAccessConfig -> (structure)
                            Specifies the access configuration file for the ML
                            model.  You  can  explicitly  accept   the   model
                            end-user  license agreement (EULA) within the Mod-
                            elAccessConfig . You are responsible for reviewing
                            and  complying  with  any applicable license terms
                            and making sure they are acceptable for  your  use
                            case before downloading or using a model.

                            AcceptEula -> (boolean)
                               Specifies  agreement  to the model end-user li-
                               cense agreement (EULA).  The  AcceptEula  value
                               must  be explicitly defined as True in order to
                               accept the EULA that this model  requires.  You
                               are  responsible  for  reviewing  and complying
                               with any applicable license  terms  and  making
                               sure  they are acceptable for your use case be-
                               fore downloading or using a model.

                 ProductId -> (string)

       --validation-specification (structure)
          Specifies  configurations  for  one  or  more training jobs and that
          SageMaker runs to test the algorithm's training  code  and,  option-
          ally,  one  or more batch transform jobs that SageMaker runs to test
          the algorithm's inference code.

          ValidationRole -> (string)
              The IAM roles that SageMaker uses to run the training jobs.

          ValidationProfiles -> (list)
              An array of AlgorithmValidationProfile objects,  each  of  which
              specifies  a training job and batch transform job that SageMaker
              runs to validate your algorithm.

              (structure)
                 Defines a training job and a batch transform job  that  Sage-
                 Maker runs to validate your algorithm.

                 The data provided in the validation profile is made available
                 to your buyers on Amazon Web Services Marketplace.

                 ProfileName -> (string)
                     The name of the profile for the algorithm. The name  must
                     have  1  to 63 characters. Valid characters are a-z, A-Z,
                     0-9, and - (hyphen).

                 TrainingJobDefinition -> (structure)
                     The  TrainingJobDefinition  object  that  describes   the
                     training  job  that SageMaker runs to validate your algo-
                     rithm.

                     TrainingInputMode -> (string)
                        The training input mode that the  algorithm  supports.
                        For more information about input modes, see Algorithms
                        .
                            Pipe mode

                        If an algorithm supports Pipe mode,  Amazon  SageMaker
                        streams data directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
                            File mode

                        If  an  algorithm  supports File mode, SageMaker down-
                        loads the training data from S3 to the provisioned  ML
                        storage volume, and mounts the directory to the Docker
                        volume for the training container.

                        You must provision the ML storage volume  with  suffi-
                        cient capacity to accommodate the data downloaded from
                        S3. In addition to the training data, the  ML  storage
                        volume  also  stores  the  output model. The algorithm
                        container uses the ML storage volume to also store in-
                        termediate information, if any.

                        For  distributed algorithms, training data is distrib-
                        uted uniformly. Your training duration is  predictable
                        if  the input data objects sizes are approximately the
                        same. SageMaker does not split the files  any  further
                        for  model  training.  If the object sizes are skewed,
                        training won't be optimal as the data distribution  is
                        also  skewed  when  one  host in a training cluster is
                        overloaded, thus becoming a bottleneck in training.
                            FastFile mode

                        If an  algorithm  supports  FastFile  mode,  SageMaker
                        streams data directly from S3 to the container with no
                        code changes, and provides file system access  to  the
                        data. Users can author their training script to inter-
                        act with these files as if they were stored on disk.
                            FastFile mode works best when the data is read se-
                            quentially.  Augmented  manifest files aren't sup-
                            ported. The startup time is lower when  there  are
                            fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

                     HyperParameters -> (map)
                        The hyperparameters used for the training job.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     InputDataConfig -> (list)
                        An  array  of Channel objects, each of which specifies
                        an input source.

                        (structure)
                            A channel is a named input  source  that  training
                            algorithms can consume.

                            ChannelName -> (string)
                               The name of the channel.

                            DataSource -> (structure)
                               The location of the channel data.

                               S3DataSource -> (structure)
                                   The  S3 location of the data source that is
                                   associated with a channel.

                                   S3DataType -> (string)
                                      If you choose S3Prefix ,  S3Uri  identi-
                                      fies  a  key name prefix. SageMaker uses
                                      all objects that match the specified key
                                      name prefix for model training.

                                      If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri iden-
                                      tifies an object that is a manifest file
                                      containing  a  list  of object keys that
                                      you want  SageMaker  to  use  for  model
                                      training.

                                      If  you  choose  AugmentedManifestFile ,
                                      S3Uri identifies an object  that  is  an
                                      augmented  manifest  file  in JSON lines
                                      format. This file contains the data  you
                                      want to use for model training. Augment-
                                      edManifestFile can only be used  if  the
                                      Channel's input mode is Pipe .

                                   S3Uri -> (string)
                                      Depending on the value specified for the
                                      S3DataType ,  identifies  either  a  key
                                      name prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                      o A  key  name  prefix  might  look like
                                        this: s3://bucketname/exampleprefix/

                                      o A  manifest  might  look  like   this:
                                        s3://bucketname/example.manifest     A
                                        manifest is an S3 object  which  is  a
                                        JSON  file  consisting  of an array of
                                        elements. The first element is a  pre-
                                        fix  which  is followed by one or more
                                        suffixes. SageMaker appends the suffix
                                        elements  to  the prefix to get a full
                                        set of S3Uri . Note  that  the  prefix
                                        must  be  a valid non-empty S3Uri that
                                        precludes users from specifying a man-
                                        ifest   whose   individual   S3Uri  is
                                        sourced from different S3 buckets. The
                                        following  code  example shows a valid
                                        manifest   format:     [    {"prefix":

                                        the  IAM  role  that SageMaker uses to
                                        perform tasks on your behalf.

                                      Your input bucket  must  be  located  in
                                      same  Amazon Web Services region as your
                                      training job.

                                   S3DataDistributionType -> (string)
                                      If you want SageMaker to  replicate  the
                                      entire  dataset  on  each ML compute in-
                                      stance that is launched for model train-
                                      ing, specify FullyReplicated .

                                      If  you  want  SageMaker  to replicate a
                                      subset of data on each  ML  compute  in-
                                      stance that is launched for model train-
                                      ing, specify ShardedByS3Key .  If  there
                                      are  n ML compute instances launched for
                                      a training job, each instance  gets  ap-
                                      proximately  1/n of the number of S3 ob-
                                      jects. In this case, model  training  on
                                      each  machine  uses  only  the subset of
                                      training data.

                                      Don't choose more ML  compute  instances
                                      for  training than available S3 objects.
                                      If you do, some nodes won't get any data
                                      and  you  will pay for nodes that aren't
                                      getting any training data. This  applies
                                      in  both  File and Pipe modes. Keep this
                                      in mind when developing algorithms.

                                      In distributed training, where  you  use
                                      multiple  ML  compute EC2 instances, you
                                      might choose ShardedByS3Key . If the al-
                                      gorithm  requires  copying training data
                                      to the ML storage volume (when Training-
                                      InputMode  is set to File ), this copies
                                      1/n of the number of objects.

                                   AttributeNames -> (list)
                                      A list of one or more attribute names to
                                      use  that  are found in a specified aug-
                                      mented manifest file.

                                      (string)

                                   InstanceGroupNames -> (list)
                                      A list of names of instance groups  that
                                      get data from the S3 data source.

                                      (string)

                               FileSystemDataSource -> (structure)
                                   The  file  system that is associated with a
                                   channel.

                                   FileSystemId -> (string)
                                      The file system id.

                                   FileSystemAccessMode -> (string)
                                      The access mode of the mount of the  di-
                                      rectory  associated  with the channel. A
                                      directory can be mounted  either  in  ro
                                      (read-only) or rw (read-write) mode.

                                   FileSystemType -> (string)
                                      The file system type.

                                   DirectoryPath -> (string)
                                      The  full path to the directory to asso-
                                      ciate with the channel.

                            ContentType -> (string)
                               The MIME type of the data.

                            CompressionType -> (string)
                               If training data is compressed, the compression
                               type.  The default value is None . Compression-
                               Type is used only in Pipe input mode.  In  File
                               mode, leave this field unset or set it to None.

                            RecordWrapperType -> (string)
                               Specify  RecordIO  as the value when input data
                               is in raw format but the training algorithm re-
                               quires the RecordIO format. In this case, Sage-
                               Maker wraps each  individual  S3  object  in  a
                               RecordIO  record.  If the input data is already
                               in RecordIO format, you don't need to set  this
                               attribute.  For  more information, see Create a
                               Dataset Using RecordIO .

                               In File mode, leave this field unset or set  it
                               to None.

                            InputMode -> (string)
                               (Optional)  The  input mode to use for the data
                               channel in a training job. If you don't  set  a
                               value  for InputMode , SageMaker uses the value
                               set for TrainingInputMode . Use this  parameter
                               to  override the TrainingInputMode setting in a
                               AlgorithmSpecification request when you have  a
                               channel  that needs a different input mode from
                               the training job's general setting. To download
                               the  data  from  Amazon  Simple Storage Service
                               (Amazon S3) to the provisioned ML storage  vol-
                               ume,  and  mount the directory to a Docker vol-
                               ume, use File input mode. To  stream  data  di-
                               rectly  from Amazon S3 to the container, choose
                               Pipe input mode.

                               To use a model for incremental training, choose
                               File input model.

                            ShuffleConfig -> (structure)
                               A  configuration for a shuffle option for input
                               data in a channel.  If  you  use  S3Prefix  for
                               S3DataType  ,  this shuffles the results of the
                               S3 key prefix matches. If you use  ManifestFile
                               ,  the order of the S3 object references in the
                               ManifestFile is shuffled. If you use Augmented-
                               ManifestFile  ,  the order of the JSON lines in
                               the  AugmentedManifestFile  is  shuffled.   The
                               shuffling  order  is  determined using the Seed
                               value.

                               For Pipe input mode, shuffling is done  at  the
                               start  of every epoch. With large datasets this
                               ensures that the order of the training data  is
                               different  for each epoch, it helps reduce bias
                               and  possible  overfitting.  In  a   multi-node
                               training  job  when  ShuffleConfig  is combined
                               with S3DataDistributionType of ShardedByS3Key ,
                               the  data  is shuffled across nodes so that the
                               content sent to a particular node on the  first
                               epoch  might be sent to a different node on the
                               second epoch.

                               Seed -> (long)
                                   Determines the shuffling order in  Shuffle-
                                   Config value.

                     OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                        the  path  to  the  S3  bucket where you want to store
                        model artifacts. SageMaker creates subfolders for  the
                        artifacts.

                        KmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Web  Services  Key Management Service
                            (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that SageMaker  uses
                            to  encrypt the model artifacts at rest using Ama-
                            zon S3 server-side encryption. The KmsKeyId can be
                            any of the following formats:

                            o //             KMS             Key            ID
                              "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                            o // Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a  KMS  Key
                              "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                            o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                            o // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key Alias
                              "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/Exam-
                              pleAlias"

                            If you use a KMS key ID or an alias  of  your  KMS
                            key,  the  SageMaker  execution  role must include
                            permissions to call kms:Encrypt  .  If  you  don't
                            provide  a  KMS key ID, SageMaker uses the default
                            KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's account. For
                            more  information, see KMS-Managed Encryption Keys
                            in the Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  Developer

                            Express One Zone, it is encrypted with server-side
                            encryption  with  Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).
                            KMS key is not supported for Amazon S3 Express One

                        S3OutputPath -> (string)
                            Identifies the S3 path where you want SageMaker to
                            store   the   model   artifacts.   For    example,
                            s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                        CompressionType -> (string)
                            The  model output compression type. Select None to
                            output  an  uncompressed  model,  recommended  for
                            large model outputs. Defaults to gzip.

                     ResourceConfig -> (structure)
                        The  resources, including the ML compute instances and
                        ML storage volumes, to use for model training.

                        InstanceType -> (string)
                            The ML compute instance type.

                                   Amazon EC2  P4de  instances  (currently  in
                                   preview)  are powered by 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs
                                   with 80GB high-performance HBM2e  GPU  mem-
                                   ory, which accelerate the speed of training

                                   datasets  of  high-resolution data. In this
                                   preview release, Amazon SageMaker  supports
                                   ML   training   jobs   on   P4de  instances
                                   (ml.p4de.24xlarge ) to reduce model  train-

                        InstanceCount -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  ML  compute instances to use. For
                            distributed training, provide a value greater than
                            1.

                        VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                            The size of the ML storage volume that you want to
                            provision.

                            ML storage volumes store model artifacts  and  in-
                            cremental  states.  Training algorithms might also
                            use the ML storage volume for  scratch  space.  If
                            you  want  to  store  the  training data in the ML
                            storage volume, choose File as the  TrainingInput-
                            Mode in the algorithm specification.

                            When  using an ML instance with NVMe SSD volumes ,
                            SageMaker doesn't  provision  Amazon  EBS  General
                            Purpose  SSD  (gp2)  storage. Available storage is
                            fixed to the NVMe-type instance's  storage  capac-
                            ity. SageMaker configures storage paths for train-
                            ing datasets, checkpoints,  model  artifacts,  and
                            outputs to use the entire capacity of the instance
                            storage. For example, ML  instance  families  with
                            the  NVMe-type  instance  storage include ml.p4d ,
                            ml.g4dn , and ml.g5 .

                            When using an ML instance with the EBS-only  stor-
                            age  option and without instance storage, you must
                            define the size of EBS volume through  VolumeSize-
                            InGB  in  the  ResourceConfig API. For example, ML
                            instance families that  use  EBS  volumes  include
                            ml.c5 and ml.p2 .

                        VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The Amazon Web Services  KMS  key  that  SageMaker
                            uses  to  encrypt  data  on the storage volume at-
                            tached to the ML compute instance(s) that run  the
                            training job.

                            NOTE:
                               Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include  local
                               storage, dependent on the instance type.  Local
                               storage  volumes are encrypted using a hardware
                               module on the instance.  You  can't  request  a
                               VolumeKmsKeyId when using an instance type with
                               local storage.

                               For a list of instance types that support local
                               instance storage, see Instance Store Volumes .

                               age encryption, see SSD Instance Store  Volumes
                               .

                            The  VolumeKmsKeyId can be in any of the following
                            formats:

                            o //            KMS             Key             ID
                              "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                            o //  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a KMS Key
                              "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                        KeepAlivePeriodInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The  duration of time in seconds to retain config-
                            ured resources  in  a  warm  pool  for  subsequent
                            training jobs.

                        InstanceGroups -> (list)
                            The  configuration  of  a heterogeneous cluster in
                            JSON format.

                            (structure)
                               Defines an  instance  group  for  heterogeneous
                               cluster  training.  When  requesting a training
                               job using the CreateTrainingJob  API,  you  can
                               configure multiple instance groups .

                               InstanceType -> (string)
                                   Specifies the instance type of the instance
                                   group.

                               InstanceCount -> (integer)
                                   Specifies the number of  instances  of  the
                                   instance group.

                               InstanceGroupName -> (string)
                                   Specifies the name of the instance group.

                     StoppingCondition -> (structure)
                        Specifies a limit to how long a model training job can
                        run. It also specifies how long a managed Spot  train-
                        ing job has to complete. When the job reaches the time
                        limit, SageMaker ends the training job. Use  this  API
                        to cap model training costs.

                        To  stop  a  job,  SageMaker  sends  the algorithm the
                        SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination  for  120
                        seconds.  Algorithms can use this 120-second window to
                        save the model artifacts.

                        MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The maximum length of time,  in  seconds,  that  a
                            training  or  compilation job can run before it is
                            stopped.

                            For compilation jobs, if the job does not complete
                            during this time, a TimeOut error is generated. We
                            recommend starting with 900 seconds and increasing
                            as necessary based on your model.

                            For  all  other jobs, if the job does not complete
                            during this time, SageMaker  ends  the  job.  When
                            RetryStrategy  is  specified  in  the job request,
                            MaxRuntimeInSeconds specifies the maximum time for
                            all  of the attempts in total, not each individual
                            attempt. The default value is 1 day.  The  maximum
                            value is 28 days.

                            The maximum time that a TrainingJob can run in to-
                            tal, including any time spent  publishing  metrics
                            or  archiving  and  uploading  models after it has
                            been stopped, is 30 days.

                        MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The maximum length of time,  in  seconds,  that  a
                            managed  Spot  training job has to complete. It is
                            the amount of time spent waiting for Spot capacity
                            plus  the  amount of time the job can run. It must
                            be equal to or greater than MaxRuntimeInSeconds  .
                            If  the  job  does  not complete during this time,
                            SageMaker ends the job.

                            When RetryStrategy is specified  in  the  job  re-
                            quest,  MaxWaitTimeInSeconds specifies the maximum
                            time for all of the attempts in  total,  not  each
                            individual attempt.

                        MaxPendingTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The  maximum  length  of  time, in seconds, that a
                            training or compilation job can be pending  before
                            it is stopped.

                 TransformJobDefinition -> (structure)
                     The  TransformJobDefinition  object  that  describes  the
                     transform job that SageMaker runs to validate your  algo-
                     rithm.

                     MaxConcurrentTransforms -> (integer)
                        The  maximum  number  of parallel requests that can be
                        sent to each instance in a transform job. The  default
                        value is 1.

                     MaxPayloadInMB -> (integer)
                        The  maximum payload size allowed, in MB. A payload is
                        the data portion of a record (without metadata).

                     BatchStrategy -> (string)
                        A string that determines the  number  of  records  in-
                        cluded in a single mini-batch.
                            SingleRecord  means  only  one  record is used per
                            mini-batch. MultiRecord means a mini-batch is  set
                            to contain as many records that can fit within the
                            MaxPayloadInMB limit.

                     Environment -> (map)
                        The environment variables to set in  the  Docker  con-
                        tainer.  We support up to 16 key and values entries in
                        the map.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     TransformInput -> (structure)
                        A description of the input  source  and  the  way  the
                        transform job consumes it.

                        DataSource -> (structure)
                            Describes  the location of the channel data, which
                            is, the S3 location of the  input  data  that  the
                            model can consume.

                            S3DataSource -> (structure)
                               The  S3 location of the data source that is as-
                               sociated with a channel.

                               S3DataType -> (string)
                                   If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                                   key  name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses all
                                   objects with the specified key name  prefix
                                   for batch transform.

                                   If  you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri identi-
                                   fies an object that is a manifest file con-
                                   taining a list of object keys that you want
                                   Amazon SageMaker to use  for  batch  trans-
                                   form.

                               S3Uri -> (string)
                                   Depending  on  the  value specified for the
                                   S3DataType , identifies either a  key  name
                                   prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                   o A  key  name prefix might look like this:
                                     s3://bucketname/exampleprefix/ .

                                   o A  manifest   might   look   like   this:
                                     s3://bucketname/example.manifest      The
                                     manifest is an S3 object which is a  JSON
                                     file   with  the  following  format:    [
                                     {"prefix":                     "s3://cus-

                                     of S3Uris in  this  manifest  constitutes
                                     the  input  data for the channel for this
                                     datasource. The object that  each  S3Uris
                                     points  to  must  be  readable by the IAM
                                     role that Amazon SageMaker uses  to  per-
                                     form tasks on your behalf.

                        ContentType -> (string)
                            The  multipurpose  internet  mail extension (MIME)
                            type of the data. Amazon SageMaker uses  the  MIME
                            type  with  each http call to transfer data to the
                            transform job.

                        CompressionType -> (string)
                            If your transform data is compressed, specify  the
                            compression  type.  Amazon SageMaker automatically
                            decompresses the data for the  transform  job  ac-
                            cordingly. The default value is None .

                        SplitType -> (string)
                            The  method  to  use  to split the transform job's
                            data files into smaller batches. Splitting is nec-
                            essary  when  the total size of each object is too
                            large to fit in a single request. You can also use
                            data  splitting to improve performance by process-
                            ing multiple concurrent mini-batches. The  default
                            value for SplitType is None , which indicates that
                            input data files are not split, and  request  pay-
                            loads  contain the entire contents of an input ob-
                            ject. Set the value of this parameter to  Line  to
                            split  records  on  a  newline character boundary.
                            SplitType also supports a  number  of  record-ori-
                            ented  binary  data  formats.  Currently, the sup-
                            ported record formats are:

                            o RecordIO

                            o TFRecord

                            When  splitting  is  enabled,  the   size   of   a
                            mini-batch  depends  on  the  values of the Batch-
                            Strategy and MaxPayloadInMB parameters.  When  the
                            value  of  BatchStrategy  is  MultiRecord , Amazon
                            SageMaker sends the maximum number of  records  in
                            each  request,  up to the MaxPayloadInMB limit. If
                            the value of BatchStrategy is SingleRecord ,  Ama-
                            zon SageMaker sends individual records in each re-
                            quest.

                            NOTE:
                               Some data formats represent a record as  a  bi-
                               nary  payload wrapped with extra padding bytes.
                               When splitting is applied to a binary data for-
                               mat,  padding is removed if the value of Batch-
                               Strategy is set to SingleRecord  .  Padding  is
                               not  removed  if  the value of BatchStrategy is
                               set to MultiRecord .

                     TransformOutput -> (structure)
                        Identifies the Amazon S3 location where you want  Ama-
                        zon  SageMaker  to save the results from the transform
                        job.

                        S3OutputPath -> (string)
                            The Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon SageMaker
                            to store the results of the transform job. For ex-
                            ample, s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                            For every S3 object used as input for  the  trans-
                            form  job,  batch transform stores the transformed
                            data with an .``out`` suffix  in  a  corresponding
                            subfolder  in  the  location in the output prefix.
                            For  example,  for  the  input  data   stored   at
                            s3://bucket-name/input-name-pre-
                            fix/dataset01/data.csv ,  batch  transform  stores
                            the   transformed  data  at  s3://bucket-name/out-
                            put-name-prefix/input-name-prefix/data.csv.out   .
                            Batch transform doesn't upload partially processed
                            objects. For an input S3 object that contains mul-
                            tiple records, it creates an .``out`` file only if
                            the transform job succeeds  on  the  entire  file.
                            When  the  input contains multiple S3 objects, the
                            batch transform job processes the  listed  S3  ob-
                            jects and uploads only the output for successfully
                            processed objects. If  any  object  fails  in  the
                            transform  job  batch  transform  marks the job as
                            failed to prompt investigation.

                        Accept -> (string)
                            The MIME type used to  specify  the  output  data.
                            Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME type with each http
                            call to transfer data from the transform job.

                        AssembleWith -> (string)
                            Defines how to assemble the results of the  trans-
                            form  job  as  a single S3 object. Choose a format
                            that is most convenient to you. To concatenate the
                            results  in binary format, specify None . To add a
                            newline character at the end of every  transformed
                            record, specify Line .

                        KmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Web  Services  Key Management Service
                            (Amazon Web Services KMS) key  that  Amazon  Sage-
                            Maker  uses to encrypt the model artifacts at rest
                            using  Amazon  S3  server-side   encryption.   The
                            KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

                            o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                            o Key                                         ARN:
                              arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                            o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

                            o Alias                  name                 ARN:

                              pleAlias

                            If  you  don't  provide a KMS key ID, Amazon Sage-
                            Maker uses the default KMS key for Amazon  S3  for
                            your  role's  account.  For  more information, see

                            The  KMS  key  policy must grant permission to the
                            IAM role that you specify in your CreateModel  re-
                            quest.  For  more information, see Using Key Poli-

                     TransformResources -> (structure)
                        Identifies  the ML compute instances for the transform
                        job.

                        InstanceType -> (string)
                            The ML compute instance  type  for  the  transform
                            job.  If  you  are  using  built-in  algorithms to
                            transform moderately sized datasets, we  recommend
                            using ml.m4.xlarge or ml.m5.large instance types.

                        InstanceCount -> (integer)
                            The  number  of ML compute instances to use in the
                            transform job. The default value is 1  ,  and  the
                            maximum  is  100 . For distributed transform jobs,
                            specify a value greater than 1 .

                        VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The Amazon Web  Services  Key  Management  Service
                            (Amazon  Web  Services  KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                            Maker uses to encrypt model data  on  the  storage
                            volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that
                            run the batch transform job.

                            NOTE:
                               Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include  local
                               storage,  dependent on the instance type. Local
                               storage volumes are encrypted using a  hardware
                               module  on  the  instance.  You can't request a
                               VolumeKmsKeyId when using an instance type with
                               local storage.

                               For a list of instance types that support local
                               instance storage, see Instance Store Volumes .

                            The VolumeKmsKeyId can be  any  of  the  following
                            formats:

                            o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       --certify-for-marketplace | --no-certify-for-marketplace (boolean)
          Whether  to certify the algorithm so that it can be listed in Amazon
          Web Services Marketplace.

       --tags (list)
          An array of key-value pairs. You can use  tags  to  categorize  your
          Amazon  Web  Services  resources  in different ways, for example, by
          purpose, owner, or environment. For more  information,  see  Tagging
          Amazon Web Services Resources .

          (structure)
              A  tag object that consists of a key and an optional value, used
              to manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

              You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs,  hyperpa-
              rameter  tuning  jobs,  batch  transform  jobs, models, labeling
              jobs, work teams, endpoint configurations,  and  endpoints.  For
              more  information  on  adding  tags  to SageMaker resources, see
              AddTags .

              For more information on adding metadata to your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  resources  with  tagging, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
              resources . For advice on best practices for managing Amazon Web
              Services resources with tagging, see Tagging Best Practices: Im-
              plement an Effective Amazon Web Services Resource Tagging Strat-
              egy .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key. Tag keys must be unique per resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
