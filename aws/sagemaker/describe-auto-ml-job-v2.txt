OPTIONS
       --auto-ml-job-name (string)
          Requests information about an AutoML job V2 using its unique name.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       AutoMLJobName -> (string)
          Returns the name of the AutoML job V2.

       AutoMLJobArn -> (string)
          Returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AutoML job V2.

       AutoMLJobInputDataConfig -> (list)
          Returns  an  array  of channel objects describing the input data and
          their location.

          (structure)
              A channel is a named input source that training  algorithms  can
              consume.  This  channel is used for AutoML jobs V2 (jobs created
              by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ).

              ChannelType -> (string)
                 The type of channel. Defines whether the data  are  used  for
                 training or validation. The default value is training . Chan-
                 nels for training and validation must share the same Content-
                 Type

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The  content type of the data from the input source. The fol-
                 lowing are the allowed content types for different problems:

                 o For Tabular problem types: text/csv;header=present or x-ap-
                   plication/vnd.amazon+parquet   .   The   default  value  is
                   text/csv;header=present .

                 o For ImageClassification: image/png , image/jpeg  ,  or  im-
                   age/* . The default value is image/* .

                 o For TextClassification: text/csv;header=present or x-appli-
                   cation/vnd.amazon+parquet   .   The   default   value    is
                   text/csv;header=present .

              CompressionType -> (string)
                 The  allowed compression types depend on the input format and
                 problem type. We allow the compression type Gzip for S3Prefix
                 inputs  on  tabular data only. For all other inputs, the com-
                 pression type should be None . If no compression type is pro-
                 vided, we default to None .

              DataSource -> (structure)
                 The data source for an AutoML channel (Required).

                 S3DataSource -> (structure)
                     The Amazon S3 location of the input data.

                     S3DataType -> (string)
                        The data type.

                        o If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a key name
                          prefix. SageMaker uses all objects  that  match  the
                          specified  key  name  prefix for model training. The
                          S3Prefix   should   have   the   following   format:
                          s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER-OR-FILE

                        o If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri identifies an ob-
                          ject that is a manifest file containing  a  list  of
                          object keys that you want SageMaker to use for model
                          training. A  ManifestFile  should  have  the  format
                          shown    below:     [   {"prefix":   "s3://DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DOC-EXAMPLE-PREFIX/"},
                          "DOC-EXAMPLE-RELATIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-FOLDER/DATA-1",               "DOC-EXAMPLE-RELA-
                          TIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DATA-2",            ...
                          "DOC-EXAMPLE-RELATIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-FOLDER/DATA-N" ]

                        o If  you choose AugmentedManifestFile , S3Uri identi-
                          fies an object that is an augmented manifest file in
                          JSON  lines  format. This file contains the data you
                          want to use for model  training.  AugmentedManifest-
                          File is available for V2 API jobs only (for example,
                          for jobs created  by  calling  CreateAutoMLJobV2  ).
                          Here  is a minimal, single-record example of an Aug-
                          mentedManifestFile :  {"source-ref": "s3://DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/cats/cat.jpg",    "la-
                          bel-metadata": {"class-name": "cat" } For  more  in-
                          formation  on  AugmentedManifestFile  ,  see Provide
                          Dataset Metadata to Training Jobs with an  Augmented
                          Manifest File .

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        The  URL  to the Amazon S3 data source. The Uri refers
                        to the Amazon S3 prefix or ManifestFile  depending  on
                        the data type.

       OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
          Returns the job's output data config.

              The Key Management Service (KMS) encryption key ID.

          S3OutputPath -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 output path. Must be 128 characters or less.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the  Identity and Access Management role that has read
          permission to the input data location and write  permission  to  the
          output data location in Amazon S3.

       AutoMLJobObjective -> (structure)
          Returns the job's objective.

          MetricName -> (string)
              The  name of the objective metric used to measure the predictive
              quality of a  machine  learning  system.  During  training,  the
              model's  parameters are updated iteratively to optimize its per-
              formance based on the feedback provided by the objective  metric
              when evaluating the model on the validation dataset.

              For  the  list  of all available metrics supported by Autopilot,
              see Autopilot metrics .

              If you do not specify a metric explicitly, the default  behavior
              is to automatically use:

              o For tabular problem types:

                o Regression: MSE .

                o Binary classification: F1 .

                o Multiclass classification: Accuracy .

              o For image or text classification problem types: Accuracy

       AutoMLProblemTypeConfig -> (tagged union structure)
          Returns  the  configuration settings of the problem type set for the
          AutoML job V2.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: ImageClassificationJobConfig, TextClassi-
              ficationJobConfig, TabularJobConfig.

          ImageClassificationJobConfig -> (structure)
              Settings used to configure an AutoML job V2 for the image  clas-
              sification problem type.

              CompletionCriteria -> (structure)
                 How  long  a  job is allowed to run, or how many candidates a
                 job is allowed to generate.

                 MaxCandidates -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of times a training job is allowed  to
                     run.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     the supported value is 1.

                 MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job exe-
                     cuted  inside  hyperparameter tuning is allowed to run as
                     part of a hyperparameter tuning job.  For  more  informa-
                     tion,    see    the   StoppingCondition   used   by   the
                     CreateHyperParameterTuningJob action.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     this field controls the runtime of the job candidate.

                 MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  runtime,  in  seconds, an AutoML job has to
                     complete.

                     If an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job  is
                     stopped  automatically and its processing is ended grace-
                     fully. The AutoML job identifies  the  best  model  whose
                     training  was completed and marks it as the best-perform-
                     ing model. Any unfinished steps of the job, such as auto-
                     matic  one-click Autopilot model deployment, are not com-
                     pleted.

          TextClassificationJobConfig -> (structure)
              Settings used to configure an AutoML job V2 for the text classi-
              fication problem type.

                 MaxCandidates -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of times a training job is allowed  to
                     run.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     the supported value is 1.

                 MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job exe-
                     cuted  inside  hyperparameter tuning is allowed to run as
                     part of a hyperparameter tuning job.  For  more  informa-
                     tion,    see    the   StoppingCondition   used   by   the

                     The  maximum  runtime,  in  seconds, an AutoML job has to
                     complete.

                     If an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job  is
                     stopped  automatically and its processing is ended grace-
                     fully. The AutoML job identifies  the  best  model  whose
                     training  was completed and marks it as the best-perform-
                     ing model. Any unfinished steps of the job, such as auto-

                 The configuration information of  how  model  candidates  are
                 generated.

                 AlgorithmsConfig -> (list)
                     Stores the configuration information for the selection of
                     algorithms used to  train  model  candidates  on  tabular
                     data.

                     The  list  of available algorithms to choose from depends
                     on the  training  mode  set  in  `  TabularJobConfig.Mode
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_TabularJobConfig.html`__
                     .

                     o AlgorithmsConfig should not be  set  in  AUTO  training
                       mode.

                     o When AlgorithmsConfig is provided, one AutoMLAlgorithms
                       attribute must be set and one only. If the list of  al-
                       gorithms  provided  as  values  for AutoMLAlgorithms is
                       empty, CandidateGenerationConfig uses the full  set  of
                       algorithms for the given training mode.

                     o When AlgorithmsConfig is not provided, CandidateGenera-
                       tionConfig uses the full  set  of  algorithms  for  the
                       given training mode.

                     For  the  list  of  all  algorithms  per problem type and
                     training mode, see AutoMLAlgorithmConfig .

                     For more information on each algorithm, see the Algorithm
                     support section in Autopilot developer guide.

                     (structure)
                        The  collection  of  algorithms  run  on a dataset for
                        training the model candidates of an Autopilot job.

                            The selection of algorithms run on  a  dataset  to
                            train the model candidates of an Autopilot job.

                            NOTE:
                               Selected  algorithms  must  belong  to the list
                               corresponding  to  the  training  mode  set  in
                               AutoMLJobConfig.Mode (ENSEMBLING or HYPERPARAM-
                               ETER_TUNING ). Choose a minimum of 1 algorithm.

                            (string)

              CompletionCriteria -> (structure)
                 How long a job is allowed to run, or how  many  candidates  a
                 job is allowed to generate.

                 MaxCandidates -> (integer)
                     The  maximum number of times a training job is allowed to
                     run.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     the supported value is 1.

                 MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job exe-
                     cuted inside hyperparameter tuning is allowed to  run  as
                     part  of  a  hyperparameter tuning job. For more informa-
                     tion,   see   the   StoppingCondition   used    by    the
                     CreateHyperParameterTuningJob action.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     this field controls the runtime of the job candidate.

                 MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum runtime, in seconds, an  AutoML  job  has  to
                     complete.

                     If  an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job is
                     stopped automatically and its processing is ended  grace-
                     fully.  The  AutoML  job  identifies the best model whose
                     training was completed and marks it as the  best-perform-
                     ing model. Any unfinished steps of the job, such as auto-
                     matic one-click Autopilot model deployment, are not  com-
                     pleted.

              FeatureSpecificationS3Uri -> (string)
                 A  URL  to the Amazon S3 data source containing selected fea-
                 tures from the input data source to run an Autopilot job  V2.
                 You can input FeatureAttributeNames (optional) in JSON format
                 as shown below:
                     { "FeatureAttributeNames":["col1", "col2", ...] } .

                 You can also specify the data type of the feature  (optional)
                 in the format shown below:
                     { "FeatureDataTypes":{"col1":"numeric", "col2":"categori-
                     cal" ... } }

                 NOTE:
                     These column keys may not include the target column.

                 In ensembling mode, Autopilot  only  supports  the  following
                 data  types: numeric , categorical , text , and datetime . In
                 HPO mode, Autopilot can support numeric , categorical ,  text
                 , datetime , and sequence .

                 If only FeatureDataTypes is provided, the column keys (col1 ,
                 col2 ,..) should be a subset of the column names in the input
                 data.

                 If  both  FeatureDataTypes and FeatureAttributeNames are pro-
                 vided, then the column keys should be a subset of the  column
                 names provided in FeatureAttributeNames .

                 The  key  name  FeatureAttributeNames  is  fixed.  The values
                 listed in ["col1", "col2", ...] are case sensitive and should
                 be a list of strings containing unique values that are a sub-
                 set of the column names in the input data. The list  of  col-
                 umns provided must not include the target column.

              Mode -> (string)
                 The method that Autopilot uses to train the data. You can ei-
                 ther specify the mode manually or let  Autopilot  choose  for
                 you  based  on  the  dataset size by selecting AUTO . In AUTO
                 mode, Autopilot chooses ENSEMBLING for datasets smaller  than
                 100 MB, and HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING for larger ones.

                 The ENSEMBLING mode uses a multi-stack ensemble model to pre-
                 dict classification and regression tasks directly  from  your
                 dataset.  This  machine  learning  mode combines several base
                 models to produce an optimal predictive model. It then uses a
                 stacking  ensemble  method  to  combine predictions from con-
                 tributing members. A multi-stack ensemble model  can  provide
                 better  performance over a single model by combining the pre-
                 dictive capabilities of multiple models. See Autopilot  algo-
                 rithm  support  for  a list of algorithms supported by ENSEM-
                 BLING mode.

                 The HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING (HPO) mode uses the  best  hyperpa-
                 rameters  to train the best version of a model. HPO automati-
                 cally selects an algorithm for the type of problem  you  want
                 to  solve.  Then HPO finds the best hyperparameters according
                 to your objective metric. See Autopilot algorithm support for
                 a list of algorithms supported by HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING mode.

              GenerateCandidateDefinitionsOnly -> (boolean)

              TargetAttributeName -> (string)
                 The  name of the target variable in supervised learning, usu-
                 ally represented by 'y'.

              SampleWeightAttributeName -> (string)
                 If specified, this column name indicates which column of  the
                 dataset  should  be  treated as sample weights for use by the
                 objective metric during the training, evaluation, and the se-
                 lection of the best model. This column is not considered as a
                 predictive feature. For more information  on  Autopilot  met-
                 rics, see Metrics and validation .

                 Sample  weights  should be numeric, non-negative, with larger
                 values indicating which rows are more important than  others.
                 Data  points  that  have  invalid  or no weight value are ex-
                 cluded.

                 Support for sample weights is available  in  Ensembling  mode
                 only.

                 (string)

       AutoMLJobArtifacts -> (structure)
          The artifacts that are generated during an AutoML job.

          CandidateDefinitionNotebookLocation -> (string)
              The URL of the notebook location.

          DataExplorationNotebookLocation -> (string)
              The URL of the notebook location.

       ResolvedAttributes -> (structure)
          Returns the resolved attributes used by the AutoML job V2.

          AutoMLJobObjective -> (structure)
              Specifies a metric to minimize or maximize as the objective of a
              job.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the objective metric used to measure the  predic-
                 tive  quality  of a machine learning system. During training,
                 the model's parameters are updated  iteratively  to  optimize
                 its  performance based on the feedback provided by the objec-
                 tive metric when  evaluating  the  model  on  the  validation
                 dataset.

                 For the list of all available metrics supported by Autopilot,
                 see Autopilot metrics .

                 If you do not specify a metric explicitly, the default behav-
                 ior is to automatically use:

                 o For tabular problem types:

                   o Regression: MSE .

                   o Binary classification: F1 .

                   o Multiclass classification: Accuracy .

                 o For image or text classification problem types: Accuracy

          CompletionCriteria -> (structure)
              How  long  a job is allowed to run, or how many candidates a job
              is allowed to generate.

              MaxCandidates -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of times a training job is allowed to run.

                 For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ), the
                 supported value is 1.

              MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job executed
                 inside hyperparameter tuning is allowed to run as part  of  a
                 hyperparameter  tuning  job.  For  more  information, see the
                 StoppingCondition used by  the  CreateHyperParameterTuningJob
                 action.

                 For  job  V2s  (jobs  created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                 this field controls the runtime of the job candidate.

              MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum runtime, in seconds, an AutoML job  has  to  com-
                 plete.

                 If  an  AutoML  job  exceeds  the maximum runtime, the job is
                 stopped automatically and its processing is ended gracefully.
                 The  AutoML  job identifies the best model whose training was
                 completed and marks it as the best-performing model. Any  un-
                 finished  steps  of  the job, such as automatic one-click Au-
                 topilot model deployment, are not completed.

          AutoMLProblemTypeResolvedAttributes -> (tagged union structure)
              Defines the resolved attributes specific to a problem type.

              NOTE:
                 This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the  following
                 top level keys can be set: TabularResolvedAttributes.

              TabularResolvedAttributes -> (structure)
                 Defines the resolved attributes for the TABULAR problem type.

                 ProblemType -> (string)
                     The type of supervised learning problem available for the
                     model candidates of the AutoML job V2 (Binary Classifica-
                     tion,  Multiclass  Classification,  Regression). For more
                     information, see Amazon SageMaker Autopilot problem types
                     .

       AutoMLProblemTypeConfigName -> (string)
          Returns  the  name of the problem type configuration set for the Au-
          toML job V2.
