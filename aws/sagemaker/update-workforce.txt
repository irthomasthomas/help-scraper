UPDATE-WORKFORCE()                                          UPDATE-WORKFORCE()



NAME
       update-workforce -

DESCRIPTION
       Use this operation to update your workforce. You can use this operation
       to require that workers use specific IP addresses to work on tasks  and
       to  update your OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP) workforce
       configuration.

       The worker portal is now supported in VPC and public internet.

       Use SourceIpConfig to restrict worker access to  tasks  to  a  specific
       range  of  IP addresses. You specify allowed IP addresses by creating a
       list of up to ten CIDRs . By default, a workforce isn't  restricted  to
       specific  IP addresses. If you specify a range of IP addresses, workers
       who attempt to access tasks using any IP address outside the  specified
       range  are  denied and get a Not Found error message on the worker por-
       tal.

       To restrict access to all the workers in public internet, add the Sour-
       ceIpConfig CIDR value as "0.0.0.0/0".

       WARNING:
          Amazon  SageMaker  does not support Source Ip restriction for worker
          portals in VPC.

       Use OidcConfig to update the configuration of a workforce created using
       your own OIDC IdP.

       WARNING:
          You  can  only  update your OIDC IdP configuration when there are no
          work teams associated with your workforce. You can delete work teams
          using the operation.

       After  restricting  access  to a range of IP addresses or updating your
       OIDC IdP configuration with this operation, you can view details  about
       your update workforce using the operation.

       WARNING:
          This operation only applies to private workforces.
