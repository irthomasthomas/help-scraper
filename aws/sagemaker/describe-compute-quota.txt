OPTIONS
       --compute-quota-id (string)
          ID of the compute allocation definition.

       --compute-quota-version (integer)
          Version of the compute allocation definition.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 Count -> (integer)
                     The number of instances to add to the instance group of a
                     SageMaker HyperPod cluster.

          ResourceSharingConfig -> (structure)
              Resource  sharing  configuration. This defines how an entity can
              lend and borrow idle compute  with  other  entities  within  the
              cluster.

              Strategy -> (string)
                 The  strategy  of how idle compute is shared within the clus-
                 ter. The following are the options of strategies.

                 o DontLend : entities do not lend idle compute.

                 o Lend : entities can lend idle compute to entities that  can
                   borrow.

                 o LendandBorrow  :  entities can lend idle compute and borrow
                   idle compute from other entities.

                 Default is LendandBorrow .

              BorrowLimit -> (integer)
                 The limit on how much idle compute can be borrowed.The values

              Allows workloads from within  an  entity  to  preempt  same-team
              workloads. When set to LowerPriority , the entity's lower prior-
              ity tasks are preempted by their own higher priority tasks.

              Default is LowerPriority .

       ComputeQuotaTarget -> (structure)
          The target entity to allocate compute resources to.

              Name of the team to allocate compute resources to.

          FairShareWeight -> (integer)
              Assigned entity fair-share weight. Idle compute will  be  shared
              across  entities based on these assigned weights. This weight is
              only used when FairShare is enabled.

              A weight of 0 is the lowest priority and  100  is  the  highest.
              Weight 0 is the default.
