LIST-MLFLOW-TRACKING-SERVERS()                  LIST-MLFLOW-TRACKING-SERVERS()



NAME
       list-mlflow-tracking-servers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all MLflow Tracking Servers.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-mlflow-tracking-servers  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: TrackingServerSummaries

OPTIONS
       --created-after (timestamp)
          Use the CreatedAfter filter to only list  tracking  servers  created
          after  a  specific  date and time. Listed tracking servers are shown
          with a date and time such as "2024-03-16T01:46:56+00:00" . The  Cre-
          atedAfter parameter takes in a Unix timestamp. To convert a date and
          time into a Unix timestamp, see EpochConverter .

       --created-before (timestamp)
          Use the CreatedBefore filter to only list tracking  servers  created
          before  a  specific date and time. Listed tracking servers are shown
          with a date and time such as "2024-03-16T01:46:56+00:00" . The  Cre-
          atedBefore  parameter  takes  in a Unix timestamp. To convert a date
          and time into a Unix timestamp, see EpochConverter .

       --tracking-server-status (string)
          Filter for tracking servers with a specified creation status.

          Possible values:

          o Creating

          o Created

          o CreateFailed

          o Updating

          o Updated

          o UpdateFailed

          o Deleting

          o DeleteFailed

          o Stopping

          o Stopped

          o StopFailed

          o Starting

          o Started

          o StartFailed

          o MaintenanceInProgress

          o MaintenanceComplete

          o MaintenanceFailed

       --mlflow-version (string)
          Filter for tracking servers using the specified MLflow version.

       --sort-by (string)
          Filter for trackings servers sorting by name, creation time, or cre-
          ation status.

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

       --sort-order (string)
          Change  the order of the listed tracking servers. By default, track-
          ing servers are listed in Descending  order  by  creation  time.  To
          change the list order, you can specify SortOrder to be Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
