NAME
       search-training-plan-offerings -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches  for available training plan offerings based on specified cri-
       teria.

       o Users search for available plan offerings based on their requirements
         (e.g., instance type, count, start time, duration).

       o And  then, they create a plan that best matches their needs using the
         ID of the plan offering they want to use.

       For more information about how to reserve GPU capacity for  your  Sage-
       Maker  training  jobs or SageMaker HyperPod clusters using Amazon Sage-
       Maker Training Plan , see `` CreateTrainingPlan `` .

OPTIONS
       --instance-type (string)
          The type of instance you want to search for in the available  train-
          ing  plan  offerings. This field allows you to filter the search re-
          sults based on the specific compute resources you require  for  your
          SageMaker training jobs or SageMaker HyperPod clusters. When search-
          ing for training plan offerings, specifying the instance type  helps
          you find Reserved Instances that match your computational needs.

          Possible values:

          o ml.p4d.24xlarge

          o ml.p5.48xlarge

          o ml.p5e.48xlarge

          o ml.p5en.48xlarge

          o ml.trn2.48xlarge

       --instance-count (integer)
          The number of instances you want to reserve in the training plan of-
          ferings. This allows you to specify  the  quantity  of  compute  re-
          sources  needed for your SageMaker training jobs or SageMaker Hyper-
          Pod clusters, helping you  find  reserved  capacity  offerings  that
          match your requirements.

       --start-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter to search for training plan offerings with a start time af-
          ter a specified date.

       --end-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter to search for reserved capacity offerings with an end  time
          before a specified date.

       --duration-hours (long)
          The desired duration in hours for the training plan offerings.

       --target-resources (list)
          The  target  resources (e.g., SageMaker Training Jobs, SageMaker Hy-
          perPod) to search for in the offerings.

          Training plans are specific to their target resource.

          o A training plan designed for SageMaker training jobs can  only  be
            used to schedule and run training jobs.

          o A  training  plan for HyperPod clusters can be used exclusively to
            provide compute resources to a cluster's instance group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            training-job
            hyperpod-cluster

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
