CREATE-INFERENCE-COMPONENT()                      CREATE-INFERENCE-COMPONENT()



NAME
       create-inference-component -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  inference  component,  which is a SageMaker hosting object
       that you can use to deploy a model to an  endpoint.  In  the  inference
       component  settings,  you  specify the model, the endpoint, and how the
       model utilizes the resources that the endpoint hosts. You can  optimize
       resource utilization by tailoring how the required CPU cores, accelera-
       tors, and memory are allocated. You can deploy multiple inference  com-
       ponents  to  an  endpoint,  where each inference component contains one
       model and the resource utilization needs for that individual model. Af-
       ter  you deploy an inference component, you can directly invoke the as-
       sociated model when you use the InvokeEndpoint API action.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
