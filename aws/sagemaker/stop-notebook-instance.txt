STOP-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCE()                              STOP-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCE()



NAME
       stop-notebook-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Terminates  the  ML  compute instance. Before terminating the instance,
       SageMaker disconnects the ML storage volume  from  it.  SageMaker  pre-
       serves  the  ML storage volume. SageMaker stops charging you for the ML
       compute instance when you call StopNotebookInstance .

       To access data on the ML storage volume for a  notebook  instance  that
       has  been  terminated,  call  the StartNotebookInstance API. StartNote-
       bookInstance launches another ML compute instance, configures  it,  and
       attaches the preserved ML storage volume so you can continue your work.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-notebook-instance
          --notebook-instance-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --notebook-instance-name (string)
          The name of the notebook instance to terminate.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
