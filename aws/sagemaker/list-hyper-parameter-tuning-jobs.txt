LIST-HYPER-PARAMETER-TUNING-JOBS()          LIST-HYPER-PARAMETER-TUNING-JOBS()



NAME
       list-hyper-parameter-tuning-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list  of  HyperParameterTuningJobSummary objects that describe
       the hyperparameter tuning jobs launched in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-hyper-parameter-tuning-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: HyperParameterTuningJobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is Name .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o Status

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A  string  in  the  tuning job name. This filter returns only tuning
          jobs whose name contains the specified string.

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only tuning jobs that were created  after  the
          specified time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only tuning jobs that were created before the
          specified time.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only tuning jobs that were modified after  the
          specified time.

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only tuning jobs that were modified before the
          specified time.

       --status-equals (string)
          A filter that returns only tuning jobs with the specified status.

          Possible values:

          o Completed

          o InProgress

          o Failed

          o Stopped

          o Stopping

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              TrainingJobStatusCounters -> (structure)
                 The  TrainingJobStatusCounters object that specifies the num-
                 bers  of training jobs, categorized by status, that this tun-
                 ing job launched.

                 Completed -> (integer)
                     The number of completed training jobs launched by the hy-

                     The number of training jobs that failed, but can  be  re-
                     tried.  A  failed  training job can be retried only if it

                     The  number of training jobs whose final objective metric
                     was evaluated by the hyperparameter tuning job  and  used
                     in the hyperparameter tuning process.

                 Pending -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  training  jobs  that are in progress and

                     perparameter tuning job can launch.

                 MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  maximum time in seconds that a hyperparameter tuning
                     job can run.

       NextToken -> (string)
