OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

       ProjectId -> (string)
          The ID of the project.

       ProjectDescription -> (string)
          The description of the project.

       ServiceCatalogProvisioningDetails -> (structure)

              The ID of the product to provision.

          ProvisioningArtifactId -> (string)
              The ID of the provisioning artifact.

          PathId -> (string)
              The path identifier of the product. This value  is  optional  if
              the  product has a default path, and required if the product has
              more than one path.

          ProvisioningParameters -> (list)
              A list of key value pairs that you specify when you provision  a
              product.

              (structure)
                 A  key value pair used when you provision a project as a ser-
                 vice catalog product. For information, see What is Amazon Web
                 Services Service Catalog .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key that identifies a provisioning parameter.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the provisioning parameter.

       ServiceCatalogProvisionedProductDetails -> (structure)
          Information about a provisioned service catalog product.

          ProvisionedProductId -> (string)
              The ID of the provisioned product.

          ProvisionedProductStatusMessage -> (string)
              The current status of the product.

              o AVAILABLE  - Stable state, ready to perform any operation. The
                most recent operation succeeded and completed.

              o UNDER_CHANGE - Transitive state.  Operations  performed  might
                not  have  valid  results. Wait for an AVAILABLE status before
                performing operations.

              o TAINTED - Stable state, ready to perform  any  operation.  The
                stack has completed the requested operation but is not exactly
                what was requested. For example, a request to update to a  new
                version  failed  and the stack rolled back to the current ver-
                sion.

              o ERROR - An unexpected error occurred. The provisioned  product
                exists  but the stack is not running. For example, CloudForma-
                tion received a parameter value that was not valid  and  could
                not launch the stack.

              o PLAN_IN_PROGRESS  - Transitive state. The plan operations were
                performed to provision a new product, but resources  have  not
                yet  been created. After reviewing the list of resources to be
                created, execute the plan. Wait for an AVAILABLE status before
                performing operations.

          The status of the project.

       CreatedBy -> (structure)
          Information  about  the  user who created or modified an experiment,
          trial, trial component, lineage group, project, or model card.
