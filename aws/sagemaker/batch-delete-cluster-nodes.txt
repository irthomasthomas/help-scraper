BATCH-DELETE-CLUSTER-NODES()                      BATCH-DELETE-CLUSTER-NODES()



NAME
       batch-delete-cluster-nodes -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes   specific   nodes   within   a   SageMaker  HyperPod  cluster.
       BatchDeleteClusterNodes accepts a cluster name and a list of node IDs.

       WARNING:

          o To safeguard your work, back up your data to Amazon S3 or  an  FSx
            for  Lustre  file  system before invoking the API on a worker node
            group. This will help prevent any potential data loss from the in-
            stance root volume. For more information about backup, see Use the
            backup script provided by SageMaker HyperPod .

          o If you want to invoke this API  on  an  existing  cluster,  you'll
            first    need    to    patch    the   cluster   by   running   the
            UpdateClusterSoftware API . For more information about patching  a
            cluster,  see Update the SageMaker HyperPod platform software of a
            cluster .

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the SageMaker HyperPod cluster from which to delete  the
          specified nodes.

       --node-ids (list)
          A list of node IDs to be deleted from the specified cluster.

          NOTE:
              For  SageMaker  HyperPod  clusters using the Slurm workload man-
              ager, you cannot remove instances that are configured  as  Slurm
              controller nodes.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Failed -> (list)
          A list of errors encountered when deleting the specified nodes.

          (structure)
              Represents  an  error  encountered  when  deleting a node from a
              SageMaker HyperPod cluster.

              Code -> (string)
                 The error code associated with  the  error  encountered  when
                 deleting a node.

                 The  code  provides  information about the specific issue en-
                 countered, such as the node not being found, the node's  sta-
                 tus  being  invalid for deletion, or the node ID being in use
                 by another process.

              Message -> (string)
                 A message describing the error encountered  when  deleting  a
                 node.

              NodeId -> (string)
                 The ID of the node that encountered an error during the dele-
                 tion process.

       Successful -> (list)
          A list of node IDs that were successfully deleted from the specified
          cluster.

          (string)
