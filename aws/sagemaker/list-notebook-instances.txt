LIST-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCES()                            LIST-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-notebook-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the SageMaker notebook instances in the requester's
       account in an Amazon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-notebook-instances is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: NotebookInstances

          notebook instances whose name contains the specified string.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)

          ter the specified time (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only notebook instances that were modified be-
          fore the specified time (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)

          ter the specified time (timestamp).

       --status-equals (string)

          o Deleting

          o Updating

       --notebook-instance-lifecycle-config-name-contains (string)
          A string in the name of a notebook instances lifecycle configuration
          associated with this notebook instance.  This  filter  returns  only
          notebook  instances associated with a lifecycle configuration with a
          name that contains the specified string.

       --default-code-repository-contains (string)
          A string in the name or URL of a Git repository associated with this
          notebook instance. This filter returns only notebook instances asso-
          ciated with a git repository with a name that contains the specified
          string.

       --additional-code-repository-equals (string)
          A  filter  that returns only notebook instances with associated with
          the specified git repository.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 The  URL that you use to connect to the Jupyter notebook run-
                 ning in your notebook instance.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The type of ML compute instance that the notebook instance is
                 running on.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  that  shows when the notebook instance was cre-
                 ated.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the notebook  instance  was  last
                 modified.

              NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigName -> (string)
                 The name of a notebook instance lifecycle configuration asso-

                 For information about notebook instance lifestyle  configura-
                 tions, see Step 2.1: (Optional) Customize a Notebook Instance
                 .

              DefaultCodeRepository -> (string)
                 The Git repository associated with the notebook  instance  as
                 its default code repository. This can be either the name of a
                 Git repository stored as a resource in your account,  or  the
                 URL  of a Git repository in Amazon Web Services CodeCommit or
                 in any other Git repository. When you  open  a  notebook  in-
                 stance,  it opens in the directory that contains this reposi-
                 tory. For more information, see Associating Git  Repositories

                 repositories  stored as resources in your account, or the URL
                 of Git repositories in Amazon Web Services CodeCommit  or  in
                 any  other  Git  repository. These repositories are cloned at
                 the same level as the default repository of your notebook in-
                 stance.  For  more information, see Associating Git Reposito-
                 ries with SageMaker Notebook Instances .
