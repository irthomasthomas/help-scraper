LIST-TRAINING-JOBS()                                      LIST-TRAINING-JOBS()



NAME
       list-training-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists training jobs.

       NOTE:
          When  StatusEquals  and  MaxResults  are  set  at the same time, the
          MaxResults number of training jobs are first retrieved ignoring  the
          StatusEquals  parameter  and  then they are filtered by the StatusE-
          quals parameter, which is returned as a response.

          For example, if ListTrainingJobs is invoked with the  following  pa-
          rameters:
              { ... MaxResults: 100, StatusEquals: InProgress ... }

          First,  100  trainings  jobs  with any status, including those other
          than InProgress , are selected (sorted  according  to  the  creation
          time,  from the most current to the oldest). Next, those with a sta-
          tus of InProgress are returned.

          You can quickly test the API using the following Amazon Web Services
          CLI code.
              aws   sagemaker   list-training-jobs  --max-results  100  --sta-
              tus-equals InProgress

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-training-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: TrainingJobSummaries

          A filter that returns only training jobs created after the specified
          time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only training jobs created before  the  speci-

          A string in the training job name. This filter returns only training
          jobs whose name contains the specified string.

       --status-equals (string)
          A filter that retrieves only training jobs with a specific status.

          Possible values:

          o InProgress

          o Completed

          o Failed

          o Stopping

          o Stopped

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --warm-pool-status-equals (string)
          A filter that retrieves only training jobs with a specific warm pool
          status.

          Possible values:

          o Available

          o Terminated

          o Reused

          o InUse

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TrainingJobSummaries -> (list)
          An array of TrainingJobSummary objects, each listing a training job.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information about a training job.

              TrainingJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the training job that you want a summary for.

              TrainingJobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the training job.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the training job was created.

              TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when  the  training  job  ended.  This
                 field is set only if the training job has one of the terminal
                 statuses (Completed , Failed , or Stopped ).

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp when the training job was last modified.

              TrainingJobStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the training job.

              WarmPoolStatus -> (structure)
                 The status of the warm pool associated with the training job.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the warm pool.

                     o InUse : The warm pool is in use for the training job.

                     o Available : The warm pool is available to reuse  for  a
                       matching training job.

                     o Reused : The warm pool moved to a matching training job
                       for reuse.

                     o Terminated : The warm pool is no longer available. Warm
                       pools are unavailable if they are terminated by a user,
                       terminated for a patch update, or  terminated  for  ex-
                       ceeding the specified KeepAlivePeriodInSeconds .

                 ResourceRetainedBillableTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The billable time in seconds used by the warm pool. Bill-
                     able time refers to the absolute wall-clock time.

                     Multiply  ResourceRetainedBillableTimeInSeconds  by   the
                     number  of  instances  (InstanceCount  ) in your training
                     cluster to get the total compute time SageMaker bills you
                     if you run warm pool training. The formula is as follows:
                     ResourceRetainedBillableTimeInSeconds * InstanceCount .

                 ReusedByJob -> (string)
                     The name of the matching training  job  that  reused  the
                     warm pool.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response is truncated, SageMaker returns this token. To re-
          trieve the next set of training jobs, use it in the  subsequent  re-
          quest.
