DESCRIBE-WORKFORCE()                                      DESCRIBE-WORKFORCE()



NAME
       describe-workforce -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  private  workforce information, including workforce name, Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN), and, if applicable, allowed IP address  ranges  (-
       CIDRs  ). Allowable IP address ranges are the IP addresses that workers
       can use to access tasks.

       WARNING:
          This operation applies only to private workforces.

OPTIONS
       --workforce-name (string)
          The name of the private workforce whose access you want to restrict.
          WorkforceName  is  automatically  set to default when a workforce is
          created and cannot be modified.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Workforce -> (structure)
          A  single private workforce, which is automatically created when you
          create your first private work team. You can create one private work
          force  in  each  Amazon  Web  Services Region. By default, any work-
          force-related API operation used in a specific region will apply  to
          the  workforce created in that region. To learn how to create a pri-
          vate workforce, see Create a Private Workforce .

              A list of one to ten IP address ranges (CIDRs ) to be  added  to
