NAME
       describe-edge-deployment-plan -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an edge deployment plan with deployment status per stage.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-edge-deployment-plan
          --edge-deployment-plan-name <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --edge-deployment-plan-name (string)
          The name of the deployment plan to describe.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  edge deployment plan has enough stages to require tokening,
          then this is the response from the last list of stages returned.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to select (50 by default).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
