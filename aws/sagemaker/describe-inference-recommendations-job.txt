OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The name of the job. The name must be unique within  an  Amazon  Web
          Services Region in the Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

              Maker uses to encrypt data on the storage volume attached to the
              ML compute instance that hosts the endpoint. This  key  will  be
              passed to SageMaker Hosting for endpoint creation.

              The  SageMaker  execution role must have kms:CreateGrant permis-
              sion in order to encrypt data on the storage volume of the  end-
              points  created for inference recommendation. The inference rec-
              ommendation job will fail asynchronously during endpoint config-
              uration  creation  if  the role passed does not have kms:Create-
              Grant permission.

              The KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

              o // KMS Key ID  "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key   "arn:aws:kms:<re-
                gion>:<account>:key/<key-id-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>"

              o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<account>:alias/<ExampleAlias>"
