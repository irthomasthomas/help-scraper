LIST-ASSOCIATIONS()                                        LIST-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the associations in your account and their properties.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-associations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: AssociationSummaries

OPTIONS
       --source-arn (string)
          A filter that returns only associations with  the  specified  source
          ARN.

       --destination-arn (string)
          A  filter that returns only associations with the specified destina-
          tion Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       --source-type (string)
          A filter that returns only associations with  the  specified  source
          type.

       --destination-type (string)
          A  filter that returns only associations with the specified destina-
          tion type.

       --association-type (string)
          A filter that returns only associations of the specified type.

          Possible values:

          o ContributedTo

          o AssociatedWith

          o DerivedFrom

          o Produced

       --created-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only associations  created  on  or  after  the
          specified time.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that  returns  only associations created on or before the
          specified time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The property used to sort results. The default value is CreationTime
          .

          Possible values:

          o SourceArn

          o DestinationArn

          o SourceType

          o DestinationType

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order. The default value is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

                 ment,  trial,  trial  component,  lineage  group, project, or
                 model card.

                 UserProfileArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user's profile.

                     The IAM Identity details associated with the user.  These
                     details  are  associated with model package groups, model
                     packages, and project entities only.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM identity.

                        tity.
