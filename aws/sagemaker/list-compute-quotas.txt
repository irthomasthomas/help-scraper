LIST-COMPUTE-QUOTAS()                                    LIST-COMPUTE-QUOTAS()



NAME
       list-compute-quotas -

DESCRIPTION
       List the resource allocation definitions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-compute-quotas is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ComputeQuotaSummaries

          stamp, see EpochConverter .

       --name-contains (string)
          Filter for name containing this string.

       --status (string)
          Filter for status.

          o Deleting

          o DeleteFailed

          o DeleteRollbackFailed

          o Deleted

       --cluster-arn (string)
          Filter for ARN of the cluster.

       --sort-by (string)
          Filter for sorting the list by a given value. For example,  sort  by
          name, creation time, or status.

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

          o ClusterArn

       --sort-order (string)
          The  order  of  the list. By default, listed in Descending order ac-
          cording to by SortBy . To change the list  order,  you  can  specify
          SortOrder to be Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                            The number of instances to  add  to  the  instance
                            group of a SageMaker HyperPod cluster.

                 ResourceSharingConfig -> (structure)
                     Resource  sharing  configuration. This defines how an en-
                     tity can lend and borrow idle compute with other entities
                     within the cluster.

                     Strategy -> (string)
                        The  strategy of how idle compute is shared within the
                        cluster. The following are the options of strategies.

                        o DontLend : entities do not lend idle compute.

                        o Lend : entities can lend idle  compute  to  entities
                          that can borrow.

                        o LendandBorrow  :  entities can lend idle compute and
                          borrow idle compute from other entities.

                        Default is LendandBorrow .

                     BorrowLimit -> (integer)
                        The limit on how much idle compute can be borrowed.The
                        values can be 1 - 500 percent of idle compute that the
                        team is allowed to borrow.

                        Default is 50 .

                 PreemptTeamTasks -> (string)
                     Allows  workloads  from  within  an  entity  to   preempt
                     same-team  workloads. When set to LowerPriority , the en-
                     tity's lower priority tasks are preempted  by  their  own
                     higher priority tasks.

                     Default is LowerPriority .

              ComputeQuotaTarget -> (structure)
                 The target entity to allocate compute resources to.

                 TeamName -> (string)
                     Name of the team to allocate compute resources to.

                 FairShareWeight -> (integer)
                     Assigned  entity  fair-share weight. Idle compute will be
                     shared across entities based on these  assigned  weights.
                     This weight is only used when FairShare is enabled.

                     A weight of 0 is the lowest priority and 100 is the high-
                     est. Weight 0 is the default.

              ActivationState -> (string)
                 The state of the compute allocation being described.  Use  to
                 enable or disable compute allocation.

                 Default is Enabled .

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Creation time of the compute allocation definition.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 Last modified time of the compute allocation definition.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the previous response was truncated, you will receive this token.
          Use it in your next request to receive the next set of results.
