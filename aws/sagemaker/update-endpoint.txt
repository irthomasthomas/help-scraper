UPDATE-ENDPOINT()                                            UPDATE-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       update-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Deploys  the  new  EndpointConfig specified in the request, switches to
       using newly created endpoint, and then  deletes  resources  provisioned
       for  the endpoint using the previous EndpointConfig (there is no avail-
       ability loss).

       When SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to Up-
       dating . After updating the endpoint, it sets the status to InService .
       To check the status of an endpoint, use the DescribeEndpoint API.

       NOTE:
          You must not delete an EndpointConfig in use by an endpoint that  is
          live  or  while  the UpdateEndpoint or CreateEndpoint operations are
          being performed on the endpoint. To update  an  endpoint,  you  must
          create a new EndpointConfig .

          If  you  delete  the EndpointConfig of an endpoint that is active or
          being created or updated you may lose visibility into  the  instance
          type the endpoint is using. The endpoint must be deleted in order to
          stop incurring charges.

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          The name of the endpoint whose configuration you want to update.

       --endpoint-config-name (string)
          The name of the new endpoint configuration.

       --retain-all-variant-properties  |   --no-retain-all-variant-properties
       (boolean)
          When  updating endpoint resources, enables or disables the retention
          of variant properties , such as the instance count  or  the  variant
          weight.  To retain the variant properties of an endpoint when updat-
          ing it, set RetainAllVariantProperties to true . To use the  variant
          properties  specified  in a new EndpointConfig call when updating an
          endpoint, set RetainAllVariantProperties to false . The  default  is
          false .

       --exclude-retained-variant-properties (list)
          When  you are updating endpoint resources with RetainAllVariantProp-
          erties , whose value is set to true ,  ExcludeRetainedVariantProper-
          ties specifies the list of type VariantProperty to override with the
          values provided by EndpointConfig . If you don't specify a value for
          ExcludeRetainedVariantProperties  ,  no variant properties are over-
          ridden.

          (structure)
              Specifies a production variant property type for an Endpoint.

              If you are updating an endpoint with the RetainAllVariantProper-
              ties  option  of  UpdateEndpointInput set to true , the Variant-
              Property objects listed in the  ExcludeRetainedVariantProperties
              parameter  of  UpdateEndpointInput override the existing variant
              properties of the endpoint.

              VariantPropertyType -> (string)
                 The type of variant property. The supported values are:

                 o DesiredInstanceCount : Overrides the existing  variant  in-
                   stance  counts using the InitialInstanceCount values in the
                   ProductionVariants of CreateEndpointConfig .

                 o DesiredWeight : Overrides the existing variant weights  us-
                   ing  the InitialVariantWeight values in the ProductionVari-
                   ants of CreateEndpointConfig .

                 o DataCaptureConfig : (Not currently supported.)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VariantPropertyType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "VariantPropertyType": "DesiredInstanceCount"|"DesiredWeight"|"DataCaptureConfig"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --deployment-config (structure)
          The deployment configuration for an endpoint, which contains the de-
          sired deployment strategy and rollback configurations.

          BlueGreenUpdatePolicy -> (structure)
              Update policy for a blue/green deployment. If this update policy
              is specified, SageMaker creates a new fleet during  the  deploy-
              ment while maintaining the old fleet. SageMaker flips traffic to
              the new fleet according to the specified traffic routing config-
              uration. Only one update policy should be used in the deployment
              configuration. If no update policy is specified, SageMaker  uses
              a blue/green deployment strategy with all at once traffic shift-
              ing by default.

              TrafficRoutingConfiguration -> (structure)

                       in a single step.

                     o CANARY : Endpoint traffic shifts to the  new  fleet  in
                       two  steps.  The  first  step is the canary, which is a
                       small portion of the traffic. The second  step  is  the
                       remainder of the traffic.

                     o LINEAR  : Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in n

                          number of instances.

                        o CAPACITY_PERCENT : The endpoint activates  based  on
                          the specified percentage of capacity.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines  the  capacity size, either as a number of in-

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines the capacity size, either as a number  of  in-
                        stances or a capacity percentage.

              TerminationWaitInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Additional waiting time in seconds after the completion of an
                 endpoint  deployment  before  terminating  the  old  endpoint
                 fleet. Default is 0.

              MaximumExecutionTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Maximum  execution  timeout for the deployment. Note that the
                 timeout value should be larger than the  total  waiting  time
                 specified  in TerminationWaitInSeconds and WaitIntervalInSec-
                 onds .

          RollingUpdatePolicy -> (structure)
              Specifies a rolling deployment strategy for updating a SageMaker
              endpoint.

              MaximumBatchSize -> (structure)
                 Batch  size  for  each rolling step to provision capacity and
                 turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet, and terminate  ca-
                 pacity on the old endpoint fleet. Value must be between 5% to
                 50% of the variant's total instance count.

                 Type -> (string)
                     Specifies the endpoint capacity type.

                     o INSTANCE_COUNT : The endpoint activates  based  on  the
                       number of instances.

                     o CAPACITY_PERCENT  : The endpoint activates based on the
                       specified percentage of capacity.

                 Value -> (integer)
                     Defines the capacity size, either  as  a  number  of  in-

                 rolling step to provision capacity and turn on traffic on the
                 old  endpoint  fleet,  and terminate capacity on the new end-
                 point fleet. If this field is absent, the default value  will
