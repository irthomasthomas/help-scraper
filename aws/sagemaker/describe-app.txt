OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The domain ID.

       --user-profile-name (string)
          The user profile name. If this value is not set, then SpaceName must
          be set.

       --space-name (string)
          The name of the space.

       --app-type (string)
          The type of app.

          Possible values:

          o JupyterServer

          o KernelGateway

          o DetailedProfiler

          o TensorBoard

          o CodeEditor

          o JupyterLab

          o RStudioServerPro

          o RSessionGateway

          o Canvas

       --app-name (string)
          The name of the app.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AppArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the app.

       AppType -> (string)
          The type of app.

       AppName -> (string)
          The name of the app.

       DomainId -> (string)
          The domain ID.

       UserProfileName -> (string)
          The user profile name.

       SpaceName -> (string)
          The name of the space. If this value is not set,  then  UserProfile-
          Name must be set.

       Status -> (string)
          The status.

       LastHealthCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the last health check.

       LastUserActivityTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the last user's activity. LastUserActivityTimestamp
          is also updated when SageMaker performs health checks  without  user
          activity.  As  a  result,  this  value  is  set to the same value as
          LastHealthCheckTimestamp .

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The creation time of the application.

          NOTE:
              After an application has been shut down for 24 hours,  SageMaker
              deletes  all  metadata  for the application. To be considered an
              update and retain application  metadata,  applications  must  be
              restarted  within  24  hours  after the previous application has
              been shut down. After this time window, creation of an  applica-
              tion  is  considered  a new application rather than an update of
              the previous application.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          The failure reason.

       ResourceSpec -> (structure)
          The instance type and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  Sage-
          Maker image created on the instance.

          SageMakerImageArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the SageMaker image that the image version belongs
              to.

          SageMakerImageVersionArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the image version created on the instance.

          SageMakerImageVersionAlias -> (string)
              The SageMakerImageVersionAlias of the image to launch with. This
              value is in SemVer 2.0.0 versioning format.

          InstanceType -> (string)
              The instance type that the image version runs on.

              NOTE:
                     JupyterServer apps only support the system value.

                 For  KernelGateway  apps  , the system value is translated to
                 ml.t3.medium . KernelGateway apps also support all other val-
                 ues for available instance types.

          LifecycleConfigArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the Lifecycle Configuration
              attached to the Resource.
