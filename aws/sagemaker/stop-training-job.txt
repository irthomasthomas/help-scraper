STOP-TRAINING-JOB()                                        STOP-TRAINING-JOB()



NAME
       stop-training-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops  a training job. To stop a job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the
       SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination  for  120  seconds.  Algo-
       rithms might use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so
       the results of the training is not lost.

       When it receives a StopTrainingJob request, SageMaker changes the  sta-
       tus of the job to Stopping . After SageMaker stops the job, it sets the
       status to Stopped .

SYNOPSIS
            stop-training-job
          --training-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --training-job-name (string)
          The name of the training job to stop.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
