OPTIONS
       --inference-recommendations-job-name (string)
          The name of a previously completed Inference Recommender job.

       --recommendation-id (string)
          The  recommendation ID of a previously completed inference recommen-
          dation. This ID should come from one of the recommendations returned
          by the job specified in the InferenceRecommendationsJobName field.

          Specify either this field or the EndpointName field.

       --endpoint-name (string)
          The  name  of  an endpoint benchmarked during a previously completed
          inference recommendation job. This name should come from one of  the
          recommendations returned by the job specified in the InferenceRecom-
          mendationsJobName field.

          Specify either this field or the RecommendationId field.

       --target-cpu-utilization-per-core (integer)
          The percentage of how much utilization you want an instance  to  use
          before autoscaling. The default value is 50%.

       --scaling-policy-objective (structure)
          An  object  where you specify the anticipated traffic pattern for an
          endpoint.

          MinInvocationsPerMinute -> (integer)
              The minimum number of expected requests  to  your  endpoint  per
              minute.

          MaxInvocationsPerMinute -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number  of  expected requests to your endpoint per
              minute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MinInvocationsPerMinute=integer,MaxInvocationsPerMinute=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MinInvocationsPerMinute": integer,
            "MaxInvocationsPerMinute": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
