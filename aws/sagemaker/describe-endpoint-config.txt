OPTIONS
       --endpoint-config-name (string)
          The name of the endpoint configuration.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EndpointConfigName -> (string)
          Name of the SageMaker endpoint configuration.

       EndpointConfigArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint configuration.

       ProductionVariants -> (list)
          An  array  of ProductionVariant objects, one for each model that you
          want to host at this endpoint.

          (structure)
              Identifies a model that you want to host and the resources  cho-
              sen to deploy for hosting it. If you are deploying multiple mod-
              els, tell SageMaker how to distribute traffic among  the  models
              by specifying variant weights.

              VariantName -> (string)
                 The name of the production variant.

              ModelName -> (string)
                 The name of the model that you want to host. This is the name
                 that you specified when creating the model.

              InitialInstanceCount -> (integer)
                 Number of instances to launch initially.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The ML compute instance type.

              InitialVariantWeight -> (float)
                 Determines initial traffic distribution among all of the mod-
                 els that you specify in the endpoint configuration. The traf-
                 fic to a production variant is determined by the ratio of the
                 VariantWeight  to  the sum of all VariantWeight values across
                 all ProductionVariants. If unspecified, it defaults to 1.0.

              AcceleratorType -> (string)
                 The size of the Elastic Inference (EI) instance  to  use  for
                 the  production  variant.  EI instances provide on-demand GPU
                 computing for inference.  For  more  information,  see  Using
                 Elastic Inference in Amazon SageMaker .

              CoreDumpConfig -> (structure)
                 Specifies  configuration  for a core dump from the model con-
                 tainer when the process crashes.

                 DestinationS3Uri -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 bucket to send the core dump to.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services Key  Management  Service  (Amazon
                     Web  Services KMS) key that SageMaker uses to encrypt the
                     core dump data at rest using Amazon  S3  server-side  en-
                     cryption.  The  KmsKeyId can be any of the following for-
                     mats:

                     o // KMS Key ID  "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o //  Amazon  Resource  Name   (ARN)   of   a   KMS   Key
                       "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                     o // Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a  KMS  Key  Alias
                       "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

                     If  you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your KMS key, the
                     SageMaker execution role must include permissions to call
                     kms:Encrypt  .  If  you don't provide a KMS key ID, Sage-
                     Maker uses the default KMS key for  Amazon  S3  for  your
                     role's  account.  SageMaker  uses  server-side encryption
                     with KMS-managed keys for OutputDataConfig . If you use a
                     bucket  policy  with an s3:PutObject permission that only
                     allows objects with server-side encryption, set the  con-
                     dition    key   of   s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption   to
                     "aws:kms" . For more information, see KMS-Managed Encryp-
                     tion  Keys in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer
                     Guide.

                     The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM  role
                     that  you  specify  in your CreateEndpoint and UpdateEnd-
                     point requests. For more information, see Using Key Poli-
                     cies  in  Amazon  Web Services KMS in the Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices Key Management Service Developer Guide .

              ServerlessConfig -> (structure)
                 The serverless configuration for  an  endpoint.  Specifies  a
                 serverless   endpoint   configuration   instead   of  an  in-
                 stance-based endpoint configuration.

                 MemorySizeInMB -> (integer)
                     The memory size of your serverless endpoint. Valid values
                     are  in  1 GB increments: 1024 MB, 2048 MB, 3072 MB, 4096
                     MB, 5120 MB, or 6144 MB.

                     less endpoint can process.

              enabled).

          InitialSamplingPercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of requests SageMaker will capture. A lower value
              is recommended for Endpoints with high traffic.

              agement Service key that SageMaker uses to encrypt data  on  the
              storage  volume  attached  to the ML compute instance that hosts
              the endpoint.

              The KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

              o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

              o Key                                                       ARN:
