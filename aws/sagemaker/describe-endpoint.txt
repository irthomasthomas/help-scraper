OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          The name of the endpoint.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 Settings  that control how the endpoint routes incoming traf-
                 fic to the instances that the endpoint hosts.

                 RoutingStrategy -> (string)
                     Sets how the endpoint routes incoming traffic:

                     o LEAST_OUTSTANDING_REQUESTS : The  endpoint  routes  re-
                       quests  to the specific instances that have more capac-
                       ity to process them.

                     o RANDOM : The endpoint routes each request to a randomly
                       chosen instance.

       DataCaptureConfig -> (structure)
          The  currently  active  data capture configuration used by your End-
          point.

          EnableCapture -> (boolean)

              The Amazon S3 location being used to capture the data.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The KMS key being used to encrypt the data in Amazon S3.

       EndpointStatus -> (string)
          The status of the endpoint.

          o OutOfService : Endpoint is not  available  to  take  incoming  re-
            quests.

          o Creating : CreateEndpoint is executing.

          o Updating : UpdateEndpoint or UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities is
            executing.

          o SystemUpdating : Endpoint is undergoing maintenance and cannot  be
            updated or deleted or re-scaled until it has completed. This main-
            tenance operation does not change  any  customer-specified  values
            such  as  VPC config, KMS encryption, model, instance type, or in-
            stance count.

          o RollingBack : Endpoint fails to scale up or  down  or  change  its
            variant weight and is in the process of rolling back to its previ-
            ous configuration. Once the rollback completes,  endpoint  returns
            to  an  InService status. This transitional status only applies to
            an endpoint that has autoscaling enabled and is undergoing variant
            weight     or     capacity     changes     as     part    of    an
            UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities    call     or     when     the
            UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities operation is called explicitly.

          o InService : Endpoint is available to process incoming requests.

          o Deleting : DeleteEndpoint is executing.

          o Failed : Endpoint could not be created, updated, or re-scaled. Use
            the FailureReason value returned by DescribeEndpoint for  informa-
            tion  about the failure. DeleteEndpoint is the only operation that
            can be performed on a failed endpoint.

          o UpdateRollbackFailed : Both the rolling deployment and  auto-roll-
            back failed. Your endpoint is in service with a mix of the old and
            new endpoint configurations. For information about how  to  remedy
            this  issue  and  restore the endpoint's status to InService , see
            Rolling Deployments .

       FailureReason -> (string)
          If the status of the endpoint is Failed , the reason why it failed.

          A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was last modified.

       LastDeploymentConfig -> (structure)
          The most recent deployment configuration for the endpoint.

          BlueGreenUpdatePolicy -> (structure)
              Update policy for a blue/green deployment. If this update policy
              is  specified,  SageMaker creates a new fleet during the deploy-
              ment while maintaining the old fleet. SageMaker flips traffic to
              the new fleet according to the specified traffic routing config-
              uration. Only one update policy should be used in the deployment
              configuration.  If no update policy is specified, SageMaker uses
              a blue/green deployment strategy with all at once traffic shift-
              ing by default.

              TrafficRoutingConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Defines  the  traffic  routing strategy to shift traffic from
                 the old fleet to the new fleet during an endpoint deployment.

                 Type -> (string)
                     Traffic routing strategy type.

                       in a single step.

                     o CANARY  :  Endpoint  traffic shifts to the new fleet in
                       two steps. The first step is the  canary,  which  is  a
                       small  portion  of  the traffic. The second step is the
                       remainder of the traffic.

                     o LINEAR : Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in  n
                       steps of a configurable size.

                 WaitIntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  waiting  time (in seconds) between incremental steps
                     to turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet.

                 CanarySize -> (structure)
                     Batch size for the first step to turn on traffic  on  the
                     new  endpoint  fleet. Value must be less than or equal to
                     50% of the variant's total instance count.

                     Type -> (string)

                        o INSTANCE_COUNT : The endpoint activates based on the
                          number of instances.

                        o CAPACITY_PERCENT  :  The endpoint activates based on
                          the specified percentage of capacity.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines the capacity size, either as a number  of  in-
                        stances or a capacity percentage.

                 LinearStepSize -> (structure)
                     Batch  size  for  each step to turn on traffic on the new
                     endpoint fleet. Value must be 10-50% of the variant's to-
                     tal instance count.

                          number of instances.

                        o CAPACITY_PERCENT : The endpoint activates  based  on
                          the specified percentage of capacity.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines  the  capacity size, either as a number of in-

                        The maximum number of instances that the endpoint  can
                        provision when it scales up to accommodate an increase
                        in traffic.

                 RoutingConfig -> (structure)
                     Settings that control how the  endpoint  routes  incoming
                     traffic to the instances that the endpoint hosts.

                     RoutingStrategy -> (string)
                        Sets how the endpoint routes incoming traffic:

                        o LEAST_OUTSTANDING_REQUESTS : The endpoint routes re-
                          quests to the specific instances that have more  ca-
                          pacity to process them.

                        o RANDOM  : The endpoint routes each request to a ran-
                          domly chosen instance.

          ClarifyExplainerConfig -> (structure)
              A member of ExplainerConfig that contains configuration  parame-
              ters for the SageMaker Clarify explainer.

              EnableExplanations -> (string)
                 A JMESPath boolean expression used to filter which records to
                 explain. Explanations are activated by default. See ` Enable-
                 Explanations

                 for additional information.

              InferenceConfig -> (structure)
                 The  inference  configuration  parameter  for  the model con-
                 tainer.

                 FeaturesAttribute -> (string)
                     Provides the JMESPath expression to extract the  features
                     from  a  model  container input in JSON Lines format. For
                     example, if FeaturesAttribute is the JMESPath  expression
                     'myfeatures'  ,  it  extracts  a list of features [1,2,3]
                     from request data '{"myfeatures":[1,2,3]}' .

                 ContentTemplate -> (string)
                     A template string used to format a JSON  record  into  an
                     acceptable model container input. For example, a Content-
                     Template string '{"myfeatures":$features}' will format  a
                     list of features [1,2,3] into the record string '{"myfea-
                     tures":[1,2,3]}' . Required only when the model container
                     input is in JSON Lines format.

                 MaxRecordCount -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of records in a request that the model
                     container can process when querying the  model  container
                     for  the predictions of a synthetic dataset . A record is
                     a unit of input data that inference can be made  on,  for
                     example,  a single line in CSV data. If MaxRecordCount is
                     1 , the model container expects one record per request. A
                     value  of 2 or greater means that the model expects batch
                     requests, which can reduce overhead and speed up the  in-
                     ferencing process. If this parameter is not provided, the
                     explainer will tune the record count per request  accord-
                     ing to the model container's capacity at runtime.

                 MaxPayloadInMB -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  payload size (MB) allowed of a request from
                     the explainer to the model container. Defaults to 6 MB.

                 ProbabilityIndex -> (integer)
                     A zero-based index used to extract  a  probability  value
                     (score)  or  list from model container output in CSV for-
                     mat. If this value is not provided, the entire model con-
                     tainer  output  will  be  treated  as a probability value
                     (score) or list.
                        Example for a single class model: If  the  model  con-
                        tainer  output  consists of a string-formatted predic-
                        tion label followed by its probability: '1,0.6' ,  set
                        ProbabilityIndex  to 1 to select the probability value
                        0.6 .

                        Example for a multiclass model: If the model container
                        output consists of a string-formatted prediction label
                        followed         by          its          probability:
                        '"[\'cat\',\'dog\',\'fish\']","[0.1,0.6,0.3]"'  ,  set
                        ProbabilityIndex to 1 to select the probability values
                        [0.1,0.6,0.3] .

                 LabelIndex -> (integer)
                     A zero-based index used to extract a label header or list
                     of label headers from model container output in CSV  for-
                     mat.
                        Example for a multiclass model: If the model container
                        output consists of label headers followed by probabil-
                        ities:  '"[\'cat\',\'dog\',\'fish\']","[0.1,0.6,0.3]"'
                        , set LabelIndex to 0  to  select  the  label  headers
                        ['cat','dog','fish'] .

                 ProbabilityAttribute -> (string)
                     A JMESPath expression used to extract the probability (or
                     score) from the model container output if the model  con-
                     tainer is in JSON Lines format.
                        Example  :  If  the model container output of a single
                        request is '{"predicted_label":1,"probability":0.6}' ,
                        then set ProbabilityAttribute to 'probability' .

                 LabelAttribute -> (string)
                     A  JMESPath  expression  used to locate the list of label
                     headers in the model container output.
                        Example : If the model container output of a batch re-
                        quest   is  '{"labels":["cat","dog","fish"],"probabil-
                        ity":[0.6,0.3,0.1]}' , then set LabelAttribute to 'la-
                        bels'   to   extract   the   list   of  label  headers
                        ["cat","dog","fish"]

                 LabelHeaders -> (list)
                     For multiclass classification problems, the label headers
                     are the names of the classes. Otherwise, the label header
                     is the name of the predicted label.  These  are  used  to
                     help  readability  for  the  output of the InvokeEndpoint
                     API. See the response section under Invoke  the  endpoint
                     in the Developer Guide for more information. If there are
                     no label headers in the model container  output,  provide
                     them manually using this parameter.

                     (string)

                 FeatureHeaders -> (list)
                     The  names  of  the  features. If provided, these are in-
                     cluded in the endpoint response payload to help readabil-
                     ity  of  the InvokeEndpoint output. See the Response sec-
                     tion under Invoke the endpoint in the Developer Guide for
                     more information.

                     ble only to NLP explainability. If provided, FeatureTypes
                     must  have  at  least  one  'text'  string  (for example,
                     ['text'] ). If FeatureTypes  is  not  provided,  the  ex-
                     plainer  infers  the  feature types based on the baseline
                     data. The feature types are included in the endpoint  re-
                     sponse   payload.  For  additional  information  see  the
                     response section under Invoke the endpoint in the  Devel-
                     oper Guide for more information.

                     (string)

              ShapConfig -> (structure)
                 The configuration for SHAP analysis.

                 ShapBaselineConfig -> (structure)
                     The  configuration  for  the  SHAP baseline of the Kernal
                     SHAP algorithm.

                     MimeType -> (string)
                        The MIME  type  of  the  baseline  data.  Choose  from
                        'text/csv'  or  'application/jsonlines'  . Defaults to
                        'text/csv' .

                     ShapBaseline -> (string)
                        The inline SHAP baseline data in string format.  Shap-
                        Baseline  can  have one or multiple records to be used
                        as the baseline dataset. The format of the SHAP  base-
                        line  file  should  be the same format as the training
                        dataset. For example, if the training  dataset  is  in
                        CSV format and each record contains four features, and
                        all features are numerical, then  the  format  of  the
                        baseline data should also share these characteristics.
                        For natural language processing (NLP) of text columns,
                        the baseline value should be the value used to replace
                        the unit of text specified by the Granularity  of  the
                        TextConfig  parameter.  The size limit for ShapBasline
                        is 4 KB. Use the ShapBaselineUri parameter if you want
                        to provide more than 4 KB of baseline data.

                     ShapBaselineUri -> (string)
                        The uniform resource identifier (URI) of the S3 bucket
                        where the SHAP baseline file is stored. The format  of
                        the  SHAP  baseline  file should be the same format as
                        the format of the training dataset.  For  example,  if
                        the training dataset is in CSV format, and each record
                        in the training dataset has  four  features,  and  all
                        features  are numerical, then the baseline file should
                        also have this same format. Each record should contain
                        only  the features. If you are using a virtual private
                        cloud (VPC), the ShapBaselineUri should be  accessible
                        to the VPC. For more information about setting up end-
                        points with Amazon Virtual  Private  Cloud,  see  Give
                        SageMaker  access  to Resources in your Amazon Virtual
                        Private Cloud .

                 NumberOfSamples -> (integer)
                     The number of samples to be used for analysis by the Ker-
                     nal SHAP algorithm.

                     NOTE:
                        The  number of samples determines the size of the syn-
                        thetic dataset, which has an impact on latency of  ex-
                        plainability  requests.  For more information, see the
                        Synthetic data of Configure and create an endpoint .

                 UseLogit -> (boolean)
                     A Boolean toggle to indicate if you want to use the logit
                     function  (true) or log-odds units (false) for model pre-
                     dictions. Defaults to false.

                     The starting value used to initialize the  random  number
                     generator  in the explainer. Provide a value for this pa-
                     rameter to obtain a deterministic SHAP result.

                 TextConfig -> (structure)
                     A parameter that indicates if text features  are  treated
                     as  text  and  explanations  are  provided for individual
                     units of text. Required for natural  language  processing
                     (NLP) explainability only.

                     Language -> (string)
                        Specifies the language of the text features in
                        `ISO 639-1 < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`__
                         or ISO 639-3 code of a supported language.

                        NOTE:
                            For a mix of multiple languages, use code 'xx' .

                     Granularity -> (string)
                        The  unit of granularity for the analysis of text fea-
                        tures. For example, if the unit is 'token' , then each
                        token  (like a word in English) of the text is treated
                        as a  feature.  SHAP  values  are  computed  for  each
                        unit/feature.

       ShadowProductionVariants -> (list)
          An  array  of  ProductionVariantSummary  objects, one for each model
          that you want to host at this endpoint in shadow mode  with  produc-

                     ProductionVariant .

                     If you used the registry/repository[:tag] form to specify
                     the image path of the primary container when you  created
                     the model hosted in this ProductionVariant , the path re-
                     solves to a path of the form registry/repository[@digest]
                     .  A  digest  is  a hash value that identifies a specific
                     version of an image. For  information  about  Amazon  ECR
                     paths,  see Pulling an Image in the Amazon ECR User Guide
