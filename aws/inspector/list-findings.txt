LIST-FINDINGS()                                                LIST-FINDINGS()



NAME
       list-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists findings that are generated by the assessment runs that are spec-
       ified by the ARNs of the assessment runs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-findings is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: findingArns

          For a record to match a filter, all specified filter attributes must
          match. When multiple values are specified for  a  filter  attribute,
          any of the values can match.

          agentIds -> (list)
              For a record to match a filter, one of the values that is speci-
              fied for this data type property must be the exact match of  the
              value of the agentId property of the  Finding data type.

              (string)

          autoScalingGroups -> (list)
              For a record to match a filter, one of the values that is speci-
              fied for this data type property must be the exact match of  the
              value  of  the  autoScalingGroup  property  of the  Finding data
              type.

              (string)

          ruleNames -> (list)
              For a record to match a filter, one of the values that is speci-
              fied  for this data type property must be the exact match of the
              value of the ruleName property of the  Finding data type.

              (string)

          severities -> (list)
              For a record to match a filter, one of the values that is speci-
              fied  for this data type property must be the exact match of the
              value of the severity property of the  Finding data type.

              (string)

          rulesPackageArns -> (list)
              For a record to match a filter, one of the values that is speci-
              fied  for this data type property must be the exact match of the
              value of the rulesPackageArn property of the  Finding data type.

              (string)

              For a record to match a filter, the  list  of  values  that  are
              specified  for  this data type property must be contained in the
              list of values of the attributes property of the   Finding  data
              type.

              (structure)
                 This  data type is used as a request parameter in the  AddAt-
                 tributesToFindings and  CreateAssessmentTemplate actions.

                 key -> (string)
                     The attribute key.

                 value -> (string)

              endDate -> (timestamp)
                 The maximum value of the timestamp range.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          agentIds=string,string,autoScalingGroups=string,string,ruleNames=string,string,severities=string,string,rulesPackageArns=string,string,attributes=[{key=string,value=string},{key=string,value=string}],userAttributes=[{key=string,value=string},{key=string,value=string}],creationTimeRange={beginDate=timestamp,endDate=timestamp}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "agentIds": ["string", ...],
            "autoScalingGroups": ["string", ...],
            "ruleNames": ["string", ...],
            "severities": ["Low"|"Medium"|"High"|"Informational"|"Undefined", ...],
            "rulesPackageArns": ["string", ...],
            "attributes": [
              {
                "key": "string",
                "value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "userAttributes": [
              {
                "key": "string",
                "value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "creationTimeRange": {
              "beginDate": timestamp,
              "endDate": timestamp
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list findings

       The  following  list-findings  command lists all of the generated find-
       ings:

          aws inspector list-findings

       Output:

          {
                  "findingArns": [

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          When  a  response  is generated, if there is more data to be listed,
          this parameter is present in the response and contains the value  to
          use  for the nextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
          If there is no more data to be listed,  this  parameter  is  set  to
          null.
