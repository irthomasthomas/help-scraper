OPTIONS
       --resource-group-arns (list)
          The ARN that specifies the resource group that you want to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe resource groups

       The following describe-resource-groups command describes  the  resource
       group  with  the  ARN  of  arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:re-
       sourcegroup/0-PyGXopAI:

          aws inspector describe-resource-groups --resource-group-arns arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resourcegroup/0-PyGXopAI

       Output:

          {
                "failedItems": {},
                "resourceGroups": [
                  {
                        "arn": "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resourcegroup/0-PyGXopAI",
                        "createdAt": 1458074191.098,
                        "tags": [
                          {
                                "key": "Name",
                                "value": "example"
                          }
                        ]
                  }
                ]
          }

       resourceGroups -> (list)
          Information about a resource group.

          (structure)
              Contains  information about a resource group. The resource group
              defines a set of tags that, when queried, identify the  AWS  re-
              sources  that  make  up the assessment target. This data type is
              used as the response element in the  DescribeResourceGroups  ac-
              tion.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource group.

              tags -> (list)
                 The  tags  (key  and value pairs) of the resource group. This
                 data type property is used in  the   CreateResourceGroup  ac-
                 tion.

                 (structure)
                     This data type is used as one of the elements of the  Re-
                     sourceGroup data type.

                     key -> (string)
                        A tag key.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value assigned to a tag key.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which resource group is created.

       failedItems -> (map)
          Resource group details that cannot be described. An  error  code  is
          provided for each failed item.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Includes details about the failed items.

              failureCode -> (string)
                 The status code of a failed item.

              retryable -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  you  can  immediately retry a request for
                 this item for a specified resource.
