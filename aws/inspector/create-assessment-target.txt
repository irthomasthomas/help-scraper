CREATE-ASSESSMENT-TARGET()                          CREATE-ASSESSMENT-TARGET()



NAME
       create-assessment-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  assessment  target using the ARN of the resource group
       that is generated by  CreateResourceGroup . If resourceGroupArn is  not
       specified,  all EC2 instances in the current AWS account and region are
       included in the assessment target. If the service-linked role isnt  al-
       ready  registered,  this  action  also  creates  and  registers  a ser-
       vice-linked role to grant  Amazon  Inspector  access  to  AWS  Services
       needed to perform security assessments. You can create up to 50 assess-
       ment targets per AWS account. You can run up to 500  concurrent  agents
       per  AWS account. For more information, see Amazon Inspector Assessment
       Targets .

OPTIONS
       --assessment-target-name (string)
          The user-defined name that identifies the assessment target that you
          want to create. The name must be unique within the AWS account.

       --resource-group-arn (string)
          The ARN that specifies the resource group that is used to create the
          assessment target. If resourceGroupArn is not specified, all EC2 in-
          stances  in  the  current AWS account and region are included in the
          assessment target.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an assessment target

       The following create-assessment-target command  creates  an  assessment
       target  named ExampleAssessmentTarget using the resource group with the
       ARN        of        arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-
       group/0-AB6DMKnv:

          aws inspector create-assessment-target --assessment-target-name ExampleAssessmentTarget --resource-group-arn arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resourcegroup/0-AB6DMKnv

       Output:

          {
              "assessmentTargetArn": "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-nvgVhaxX"
          }

       For  more  information,  see Amazon Inspector Assessment Targets in the
       Amazon Inspector guide.

OUTPUT
       assessmentTargetArn -> (string)
          The ARN that specifies the assessment target that is created.
