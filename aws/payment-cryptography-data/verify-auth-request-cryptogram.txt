VERIFY-AUTH-REQUEST-CRYPTOGRAM()              VERIFY-AUTH-REQUEST-CRYPTOGRAM()



NAME
       verify-auth-request-cryptogram -

DESCRIPTION
       Verifies Authorization Request Cryptogram (ARQC) for a EMV chip payment
       card authorization. For more information, see Verify auth request cryp-
       togram in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide .

       ARQC generation is done outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptog-
       raphy and is typically generated on a point of sale terminal for an EMV
       chip  card to obtain payment authorization during transaction time. For
       ARQC verification, you must first import the ARQC generated outside  of
       Amazon  Web  Services  Payment Cryptography by calling ImportKey . This
       operation uses the imported ARQC and an major  encryption  key  (DUKPT)
       created by calling CreateKey to either provide a boolean ARQC verifica-
       tion result or provide an APRC (Authorization Response Cryptogram)  re-
       sponse  using  Method 1 or Method 2. The ARPC_METHOD_1 uses AuthRespon-
       seCode to generate ARPC and ARPC_METHOD_2 uses CardStatusUpdate to gen-
       erate ARPC.

       For  information about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding
       key attributes and Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon
       Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide .
          Cross-account  use  :  This operation can't be used across different
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

       --transaction-data (string)
          The  transaction  data that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
          uses for ARQC verification. The same transaction is  used  for  ARQC

          The  method  to  use when deriving the major encryption key for ARQC
          verification within Amazon Web Services  Payment  Cryptography.  The

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To verify an auth request

       The following verify-auth-request-cryptogram example verifies an Autho-
       rization Request Cryptogram (ARQC).

          aws payment-cryptography-data verify-auth-request-cryptogram \
              --auth-request-cryptogram F6E1BD1E6037FB3E \
              --auth-response-attributes '{"ArpcMethod1": {"AuthResponseCode": "1111"}}' \
              --key-identifier arn:aws:payment-cryptography:us-west-2:111122223333:key/pboipdfzd4mdklya \
              --major-key-derivation-mode "EMV_OPTION_A" \
              --session-key-derivation-attributes '{"EmvCommon": {"ApplicationTransactionCounter": "1234","PanSequenceNumber": "01","PrimaryAccountNumber": "471234567890123"}}' \
              --transaction-data "123456789ABCDEF"

       Output:

          {
              "AuthResponseValue": "D899B8C6FBF971AA",
              "KeyArn": "arn:aws:payment-cryptography:us-west-2:111122223333:key/pboipdfzd4mdklya",
              "KeyCheckValue": "985792"
          }

       AWS Payment Cryptography User Guide.

OUTPUT
       KeyArn -> (string)
          The keyARN of the major encryption key that Amazon Web Services Pay-
          ment Cryptography uses for ARQC verification.

       KeyCheckValue -> (string)
          The key check value (KCV) of the encryption key. The KCV is used  to
          check if all parties holding a given key have the same key or to de-
          tect that a key has changed.

          Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography computes the KCV  according
          to the CMAC specification.

       AuthResponseValue -> (string)
          The  result  for  ARQC verification or ARPC generation within Amazon
          Web Services Payment Cryptography.
