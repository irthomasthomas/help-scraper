GENERATE-CARD-VALIDATION-DATA()                GENERATE-CARD-VALIDATION-DATA()



NAME
       generate-card-validation-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  card-related  validation  data using algorithms such as Card
       Verification  Values  (CVV/CVV2),  Dynamic  Card  Verification   Values
       (dCVV/dCVV2),  or  Card Security Codes (CSC). For more information, see
       Generate card data in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User
       Guide .

       This  operation  generates a CVV or CSC value that is printed on a pay-
       ment credit or debit card during card production. The CVV or  CSC,  PAN
       (Primary  Account  Number) and expiration date of the card are required
       to check its validity during transaction processing. To begin this  op-
       eration,  a CVK (Card Verification Key) encryption key is required. You
       can use CreateKey or ImportKey to establish a  CVK  within  Amazon  Web
       Services  Payment Cryptography. The KeyModesOfUse should be set to Gen-
       erate and Verify for a CVK encryption key.

       For information about valid keys for this operation, see  Understanding
       key attributes and Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon
       Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide .
          Cross-account use : This operation can't be  used  across  different
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

       --validation-data-length (integer)
          The length of the CVV or CSC to be generated. The default  value  is
          3.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To generate a CVV

       The  following  generate-card-validation-data   example   generates   a
       CVV/CVV2.

          aws payment-cryptography-data generate-card-validation-data \
              --key-identifier arn:aws:payment-cryptography:us-east-2:123456789012:key/kwapwa6qaifllw2h \
              --primary-account-number=171234567890123 \
              --generation-attributes CardVerificationValue2={CardExpiryDate=0123}

       Output:

          {
              "KeyArn": "arn:aws:payment-cryptography:us-east-2:123456789012:key/kwapwa6qaifllw2h",
              "KeyCheckValue": "CADDA1",
              "ValidationData": "801"
          }

       For  more  information, see Generate card data in the AWS Payment Cryp-
       tography User Guide.

OUTPUT
       KeyArn -> (string)
          The keyARN of the CVK encryption key that Amazon Web  Services  Pay-
          ment Cryptography uses to generate CVV or CSC.

       KeyCheckValue -> (string)
          The  key check value (KCV) of the encryption key. The KCV is used to
          check if all parties holding a given key have the same key or to de-
          tect that a key has changed.

          Amazon  Web Services Payment Cryptography computes the KCV according
          to the CMAC specification.

       ValidationData -> (string)
          The CVV or CSC value that Amazon Web Services  Payment  Cryptography
          generates for the card.
