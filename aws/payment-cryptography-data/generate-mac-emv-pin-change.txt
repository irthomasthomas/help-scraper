NAME
       generate-mac-emv-pin-change -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  an  issuer script mac for EMV payment cards that use offline
       PINs as the cardholder verification method (CVM).

       This operation generates an authenticated issuer script response by ap-
       pending  the  incoming  message data (APDU command) with the target en-
       crypted PIN block in ISO2 format. The command structure and  method  to
       send the issuer script update to the card is not defined by this opera-
       tion and is typically determined by the applicable payment card scheme.

       The primary inputs to this operation include the incoming new encrypted
       pinblock,  PIN  encryption  key (PEK), issuer master key (IMK), primary
       account number (PAN), and the payment card derivation method.

       The operation uses two issuer master keys - secure messaging for confi-
       dentiality  (IMK-SMC) and secure messaging for integrity (IMK-SMI). The
       SMC key is used to internally derive a key to secure the pin, while SMI
       key  is  used to internally derive a key to authenticate the script re-
       ponse as per the EMV 4.4 - Book 2 - Security and Key Management  speci-
       fication.

       This  operation  supports Amex, EMV2000, EMVCommon, Mastercard and Visa
       derivation methods, each requiring  specific  input  parameters.  Users
       must follow the specific derivation method and input parameters defined
       by the respective payment card scheme.

       NOTE:
              Use  GenerateMac operation when sending a script  update  to  an
              EMV  card  that  does not involve PIN change. When assigning IAM
              permissions, it is important to understand that  EncryptData us-
              ing  EMV keys and  GenerateMac perform similar functions to this
              command.

          Cross-account use : This operation can't be  used  across  different
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
