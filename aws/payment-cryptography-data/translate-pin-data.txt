TRANSLATE-PIN-DATA()                                      TRANSLATE-PIN-DATA()



NAME
       translate-pin-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Translates  encrypted  PIN  block from and to ISO 9564 formats 0,1,3,4.
       For more information, see Translate PIN data in the Amazon Web Services
       Payment Cryptography User Guide .

       PIN block translation involves changing the encrytion of PIN block from
       one encryption key to another encryption key  and  changing  PIN  block
       format  from  one  to another without PIN block data leaving Amazon Web
       Services Payment Cryptography. The encryption key transformation can be
       from PEK (Pin Encryption Key) to BDK (Base Derivation Key) for DUKPT or
       from BDK for DUKPT to PEK. Amazon  Web  Services  Payment  Cryptography
       supports  TDES  and  AES key derivation type for DUKPT tranlations. You
       can use this operation for P2PE (Point to Point Encryption)  use  cases
       where  the  encryption keys should change but the processing system ei-
       ther does not need to, or is not permitted to, decrypt the data.

       The allowed combinations of PIN block format translations are guided by
       PCI.  It  is important to note that not all encrypted PIN block formats
       (example, format 1) require PAN (Primary Account Number) as input.  And
       as  such,  PIN  block format that requires PAN (example, formats 0,3,4)
       cannot be translated to a format (format 1) that does not require a PAN
       for generation.

       For  information about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding
       key attributes and Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon
       Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide .

       NOTE:
              At  this time, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography does not
              support translations to PIN format 4.

          Cross-account use : This operation can't be  used  across  different
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

              (BDK) and Key Serial Number (KSN). This must  be  less  than  or
              equal  to  the  strength  of the BDK. For example, you can't use

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       KeyArn -> (string)
          The  keyARN  of  the encryption key that Amazon Web Services Payment
          Cryptography uses to encrypt outgoing PIN block data after  transla-
          tion.

       KeyCheckValue -> (string)
          The  key check value (KCV) of the encryption key. The KCV is used to
          check if all parties holding a given key have the same key or to de-
          tect  that a key has changed. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptogra-
          phy calculates the KCV by using standard  algorithms,  typically  by
          encrypting 8 or 16 bytes or "00" or "01" and then truncating the re-
          sult to the first 3 bytes, or 6 hex digits, of the resulting crypto-
          gram.

       PinBlock -> (string)
          The ougoing encrypted PIN block data after tranlation.
