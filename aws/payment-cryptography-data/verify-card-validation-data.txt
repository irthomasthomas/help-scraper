VERIFY-CARD-VALIDATION-DATA()                    VERIFY-CARD-VALIDATION-DATA()



NAME
       verify-card-validation-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Verifies  card-related  validation  data  using algorithms such as Card
       Verification  Values  (CVV/CVV2),  Dynamic  Card  Verification   Values
       (dCVV/dCVV2)  and  Card Security Codes (CSC). For more information, see
       Verify card data in the Amazon Web Services Payment  Cryptography  User
       Guide .

       This operation validates the CVV or CSC codes that is printed on a pay-
       ment credit or debit card during card payment  transaction.  The  input
       values  are  typically provided as part of an inbound transaction to an
       issuer or supporting platform  partner.  Amazon  Web  Services  Payment
       Cryptography  uses CVV or CSC, PAN (Primary Account Number) and expira-
       tion date of the card to check its validity during transaction process-
       ing.  In this operation, the CVK (Card Verification Key) encryption key
       for use with card data verification is same as  the  one  in  used  for
       GenerateCardValidationData .

       For  information about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding
       key attributes and Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon
       Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide .
          Cross-account  use  :  This operation can't be used across different
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To validate a CVV

       The following verify-card-validation-data example validates a  CVV/CVV2
       for a PAN.

          aws payment-cryptography-data verify-card-validation-data \
              --key-identifier arn:aws:payment-cryptography:us-east-2:111122223333:key/tqv5yij6wtxx64pi \
              --primary-account-number=171234567890123 \
              --verification-attributes CardVerificationValue2={CardExpiryDate=0123} \
              --validation-data 801

       Output:

          {
              "KeyArn": "arn:aws:payment-cryptography:us-east-2:111122223333:key/tqv5yij6wtxx64pi",
              "KeyCheckValue": "CADDA1"
          }

       For  more information, see Verify card data in the AWS Payment Cryptog-
       raphy User Guide.

OUTPUT
       KeyArn -> (string)
          The keyARN of the CVK encryption key that Amazon Web  Services  Pay-
          ment Cryptography uses to verify CVV or CSC.

       KeyCheckValue -> (string)
          The  key check value (KCV) of the encryption key. The KCV is used to
          check if all parties holding a given key have the same key or to de-
          tect that a key has changed.

          Amazon  Web Services Payment Cryptography computes the KCV according
          to the CMAC specification.
