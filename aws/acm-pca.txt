DESCRIPTION
       This is the Private Certificate Authority (PCA) API Reference . It pro-
       vides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the  actions
       and  data types involved in creating and managing a private certificate
       authority (CA) for your organization.

       The documentation for each action shows the API request parameters  and
       the  JSON  response.  Alternatively,  you can use one of the Amazon Web
       Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming lan-
       guage or platform that you prefer. For more information, see Amazon Web
       Services SDKs .

       Each ACM Private CA API operation has a quota that determines the  num-
       ber  of  times  the  operation can be called per second. ACM Private CA
       throttles API requests at different rates depending on  the  operation.
       Throttling means that ACM Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request
       because the request exceeds the operation's quota for the number of re-
       quests  per second. When a request is throttled, ACM Private CA returns
       a ThrottlingException error. ACM Private CA does not guarantee a  mini-
       mum request rate for APIs.

       To  see an up-to-date list of your ACM Private CA quotas, or to request
       a quota increase, log into your Amazon Web Services account  and  visit
       the Service Quotas console.
