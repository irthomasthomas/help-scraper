DISASSOCIATE-NODE()                                        DISASSOCIATE-NODE()



NAME
       disassociate-node -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  a  node  from an AWS OpsWorks CM server, and removes the
       node from the server's managed nodes. After a  node  is  disassociated,
       the  node  key  pair is no longer valid for accessing the configuration
       manager's API. For more information about how to associate a node,  see
       AssociateNode .

       A node can can only be disassociated from a server that is in a HEALTHY
       state. Otherwise, an InvalidStateException is  thrown.  A  ResourceNot-
       FoundException  is  thrown  when  the  server does not exist. A Valida-
       tionException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server from which to disassociate the node.

       --node-name (string)
          The name of the client node.

       --engine-attributes (list)
          Engine attributes that are used for disassociating the node. No  at-
          tributes are required for Puppet.
              Attributes required in a DisassociateNode request for Chef

          o CHEF_ORGANIZATION  : The Chef organization with which the node was
            associated. By default only one organization named default can ex-
            ist.

          (structure)
              A  name  and  value  pair  that is specific to the engine of the
              server.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the engine attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the engine attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disassociate nodes

       The  following  disassociate-node  command  disassociates  a node named
       i-44de882p, removing the node from management by a Chef Automate server
       named automate-06. Valid node names are EC2 instance IDs.:

          aws opsworks-cm disassociate-node --server-name "automate-06" --node-name "i-43de882p" --engine-attributes "Name=CHEF_ORGANIZATION,Value='MyOrganization' Name=CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY,Value='Public_key_contents'"

       The output returned by the command resembles the following.  Output:

          {
           "NodeAssociationStatusToken": "AHUY8wFe4pdXtZC5DiJa5SOLp5o14DH//rHRqHDWXxwVoNBxcEy4V7R0NOFymh7E/1HumOBPsemPQFE6dcGaiFk"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Delete  an AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate
       Server in the AWS OpsWorks User Guide.

OUTPUT
       NodeAssociationStatusToken -> (string)
          Contains a token which can be passed to the DescribeNodeAssociation-
          Status API call to get the status of the disassociation request.
