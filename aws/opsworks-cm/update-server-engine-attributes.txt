UPDATE-SERVER-ENGINE-ATTRIBUTES()            UPDATE-SERVER-ENGINE-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       update-server-engine-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  engine-specific  attributes  on a specified server. The server
       enters the MODIFYING state when this operation is in progress. Only one
       update  can  occur  at a time. You can use this command to reset a Chef
       server's public key (CHEF_PIVOTAL_KEY )  or  a  Puppet  server's  admin
       password (PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD ).

       This operation is asynchronous.

       This  operation  can only be called for servers in HEALTHY or UNHEALTHY
       states. Otherwise, an InvalidStateException is raised.  A  ResourceNot-
       FoundException  is  thrown  when  the  server does not exist. A Valida-
       tionException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server to update.

       --attribute-name (string)
          The name of the engine attribute to update.

       --attribute-value (string)
          The value to set for the attribute.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update server engine attributes

       The following update-server-engine-attributes command updates the value
       of the CHEF_PIVOTAL_KEY engine attribute for  a  Chef  Automate  server
       named  automate-06. It is currently not possible to change the value of
       other engine attributes.

          aws opsworks-cm update-server-engine-attributes \
              --attribute-name CHEF_PIVOTAL_KEY \
              --attribute-value "new key value" \
              --server-name "automate-06"

       The output shows you information similar to the following about the up-
       dated server.

              tials  are not stored by AWS OpsWorks CM; they are returned only
              as part of the result of createServer().
                 Attributes returned in a createServer response for Chef

              o CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY : A base64-encoded RSA  private  key
