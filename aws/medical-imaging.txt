DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the AWS HealthImaging API Reference . AWS HealthImaging is an
       AWS service for storing, accessing, and analyzing medical  images.  For
       an  introduction  to the service, see the ` AWS HealthImaging Developer
       Guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/medical-imaging/latest/devguide`__ .

       NOTE:
          We recommend using one of the AWS Software Development  Kits  (SDKs)
          for  your programming language, as they take care of request authen-
          tication, serialization, and connection management. For more  infor-
          mation, see Tools to build on AWS .

          For  information about using AWS HealthImaging API actions in one of
          the language-specific AWS SDKs, refer to the See Also  link  at  the
          end of each section that describes an API action or data type.

       The  following  sections list AWS HealthImaging API actions categorized
       according to functionality. Links are provided to actions  within  this
       Reference,  along  with links back to corresponding sections in the AWS
       HealthImaging Developer Guide so you can view  console  procedures  and
       CLI/SDK code examples.
