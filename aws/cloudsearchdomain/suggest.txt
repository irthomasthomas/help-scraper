SUGGEST()                                                            SUGGEST()



NAME
       suggest -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  autocomplete suggestions for a partial query string. You can
       use suggestions enable you to display likely matches before users  fin-
       ish  typing.  In  Amazon CloudSearch, suggestions are based on the con-
       tents of a particular text field. When you request suggestions,  Amazon
       CloudSearch  finds  all  of the documents whose values in the suggester
       field start with the specified query string. The beginning of the field
       must match the query string to be considered a match.

       For  more  information about configuring suggesters and retrieving sug-
       gestions, see Getting Suggestions in the Amazon  CloudSearch  Developer
       Guide .

       The  endpoint  for  submitting Suggest requests is domain-specific. You
       submit suggest requests to a  domain's  search  endpoint.  To  get  the
       search  endpoint for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configura-
       tion service DescribeDomains action. A domain's endpoints are also dis-
       played on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console.

OPTIONS
       --suggester (string)
          Specifies  the  name  of  the  suggester  to  use  to find suggested
          matches.

       --size (long)
          Specifies the maximum number of suggestions to return.

       --suggest-query (string)
          Specifies the string for which you want to get suggestions.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
