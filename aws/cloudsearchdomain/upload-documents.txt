UPLOAD-DOCUMENTS()                                          UPLOAD-DOCUMENTS()



NAME
       upload-documents -

DESCRIPTION
       Posts  a batch of documents to a search domain for indexing. A document
       batch is a collection of add and delete operations that  represent  the
       documents  you want to add, update, or delete from your domain. Batches
       can be described in either JSON or XML. Each item that you want  Amazon
       CloudSearch  to return as a search result (such as a product) is repre-
       sented as a document. Every document has a unique ID and  one  or  more
       fields  that contain the data that you want to search and return in re-
       sults. Individual documents cannot contain more than 1 MB of data.  The
       entire  batch  cannot exceed 5 MB. To get the best possible upload per-
       formance, group add and delete operations in batches that are close the
       5  MB  limit.  Submitting a large volume of single-document batches can
       overload a domain's document service.

       The endpoint for submitting  UploadDocuments  requests  is  domain-spe-
       cific.  To  get  the  document endpoint for your domain, use the Amazon
       CloudSearch configuration service DescribeDomains  action.  A  domain's
       endpoints  are  also  displayed  on  the domain dashboard in the Amazon
       CloudSearch console.

       For more information about formatting your data for Amazon CloudSearch,
       see Preparing Your Data in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide . For
       more information about uploading data for indexing, see Uploading  Data
       in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --documents (streaming blob)
          A batch of documents formatted in JSON or HTML.

          NOTE:
              This  argument is of type: streaming blob. Its value must be the
              path to a file (e.g. path/to/file) and must not be prefixed with
              file:// or fileb://

       --content-type (string)
          The  format  of the batch you are uploading. Amazon CloudSearch sup-
          ports two document batch formats:

          o application/json

          o application/xml

          Possible values:

          o application/json

          o application/xml

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
