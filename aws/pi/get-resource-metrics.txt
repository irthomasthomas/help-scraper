NAME
       get-resource-metrics -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  Performance Insights metrics for a set of data sources over a
       time period. You can provide specific dimension groups and  dimensions,
       and provide aggregation and filtering criteria for each group.

       NOTE:
          Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger el-
          ements, such as SQL statements, only the first  500  bytes  are  re-
          turned.

OPTIONS
       --service-type (string)
          The  Amazon  Web Services service for which Performance Insights re-
          turns metrics. Valid values are as follows:

          o RDS

          o DOCDB

          Possible values:

          o RDS

          o DOCDB

       --identifier (string)
          An immutable identifier for a data source that is unique for an Ama-
          zon  Web  Services Region. Performance Insights gathers metrics from
          this data source. In the console, the identifier is shown as Resour-
          ceID  .  When  you  call DescribeDBInstances , the identifier is re-
          turned as DbiResourceId .

          To use a DB instance as a data  source,  specify  its  DbiResourceId
          value. For example, specify db-ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU1VW2X .

       --metric-queries (list)
          An  array of one or more queries to perform. Each query must specify
          a Performance Insights metric, and can optionally  specify  aggrega-
          tion and filtering criteria.

          (structure)
              A  single  query to be processed. You must provide the metric to
              query. If no other parameters  are  specified,  Performance  In-
              sights returns all data points for the specified metric. Option-
              ally, you can request that the data points be aggregated by  di-
              mension group (GroupBy ), and return only those data points that
              match your criteria (Filter ).

              Metric -> (string)
                 The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

                 Valid values for Metric are:

                 o db.load.avg - A scaled representation of the number of  ac-
                   tive sessions for the database engine.

                 o db.sampledload.avg  - The raw number of active sessions for
                   the database engine.

                 o The counter metrics listed in Performance Insights  operat-
                   ing system counters in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

                 If  the  number  of  active sessions is less than an internal
                 Performance Insights threshold, db.load.avg  and  db.sampled-
                 load.avg are the same value. If the number of active sessions
                 is greater than the internal threshold, Performance  Insights
                 samples  the  active  sessions,  with db.load.avg showing the
                 scaled values, db.sampledload.avg showing the raw values, and
                 db.sampledload.avg  less  than  db.load.avg  .  For  most use
                 cases, you can query db.load.avg only.

              GroupBy -> (structure)
                 A specification for how to aggregate the data points  from  a
                 query  result. You must specify a valid dimension group. Per-
                 formance Insights will return all of  the  dimensions  within
                 that  group,  unless you provide the names of specific dimen-
                 sions within that group. You can also  request  that  Perfor-
                 mance Insights return a limited number of values for a dimen-
                 sion.

                 Group -> (string)

                 o A single filter for any other dimension in  this  dimension
                   group.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Metric=string,GroupBy={Group=string,Dimensions=[string,string],Limit=integer},Filter={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Metric": "string",
              "GroupBy": {
                "Group": "string",
                "Dimensions": ["string", ...],
                "Limit": integer
              },
              "Filter": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The date and time specifying the beginning of the requested time se-
          ries query range. You can't specify a StartTime that is earlier than
          7  days  ago.  By default, Performance Insights has 7 days of reten-
          tion, but you can extend this range up to 2 years. The value  speci-
          fied  is  inclusive . Thus, the command returns data points equal to
          or greater than StartTime .

          The value for StartTime must be earlier than the value for EndTime .

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The date and time specifying the end of the  requested  time  series
          query  range.  The  value specified is exclusive . Thus, the command
          returns data points less than (but not equal to) EndTime .

          The value for EndTime must be later than the value for StartTime .

       --period-in-seconds (integer)
          The granularity, in seconds, of the data points returned  from  Per-
          formance  Insights.  A  period  can be as short as one second, or as
          long as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:

          o 1 (one second)

          o 60 (one minute)

          o 300 (five minutes)

          o 3600 (one hour)

          o 86400 (twenty-four hours)

          If you don't specify PeriodInSeconds  ,  then  Performance  Insights
          will  choose  a  value  for  you,  with  a goal of returning roughly
          100-200 data points in the response.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return in the response. If more items
          exist than the specified MaxRecords value, a pagination token is in-
          cluded in the response so that the  remaining  results  can  be  re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the token, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get resource metrics

       This  example  requests  data  points  for  the db.wait_event dimension
       group, and for the db.wait_event.name dimension within that  group.  In
       the response, the relevant data points are grouped by the requested di-
       mension (db.wait_event.name).

       Command:

          aws pi get-resource-metrics --service-type RDS --identifier db-LKCGOBK26374TPTDFXOIWVCPPM --start-time 1527026400 --end-time 1527080400 --period-in-seconds 300 --metric db.load.avg --metric-queries file://metric-queries.json

       The arguments for --metric-queries are stored  in  a  JSON  file,  met-
       ric-queries.json.  Here are the contents of that file:

          [
              {
                  "Metric": "db.load.avg",
                  "GroupBy": {

                  }
              }
          ]

OUTPUT
       AlignedStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The start time for the returned metrics, after alignment to a granu-
          lar boundary (as specified by  PeriodInSeconds  ).  AlignedStartTime
          will be less than or equal to the value of the user-specified Start-
          Time .

       AlignedEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The end time for the returned metrics, after alignment to a granular
          boundary  (as specified by PeriodInSeconds ). AlignedEndTime will be
          greater than or equal to the value of the user-specified Endtime .

       Identifier -> (string)
          An immutable identifier for a data source that is unique for an Ama-
          zon  Web  Services Region. Performance Insights gathers metrics from
          this data source. In the console, the identifier is shown as Resour-
          ceID  .  When  you  call DescribeDBInstances , the identifier is re-
          turned as DbiResourceId .

       MetricList -> (list)
          An array of metric results, where each array element contains all of
          the data points for a particular dimension.

          (structure)
              A  time-ordered series of data points, corresponding to a dimen-
              sion of a Performance Insights metric.

              Key -> (structure)
                 The dimensions to which the data points apply.

                 Metric -> (string)
                     The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

                     Valid values for Metric are:

                     o db.load.avg - A scaled representation of the number  of
                       active sessions for the database engine.

                     o db.sampledload.avg  - The raw number of active sessions
                       for the database engine.

                     o The counter metrics listed in Performance Insights  op-
                       erating system counters in the Amazon Aurora User Guide
                       .

                     If the number of active sessions is less than an internal
                     Performance  Insights  threshold, db.load.avg and db.sam-
                     pledload.avg are the same value. If the number of  active
                     sessions  is greater than the internal threshold, Perfor-
                     mance  Insights  samples  the   active   sessions,   with
                     db.load.avg showing the scaled values, db.sampledload.avg
                     showing the raw values, and db.sampledload.avg less  than
                     db.load.avg   .   For  most  use  cases,  you  can  query
                     db.load.avg only.

                 Dimensions -> (map)
                     The valid dimensions for the metric.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

              DataPoints -> (list)
                 An array of timestamp-value pairs, representing  measurements
                 over a period of time.

                 (structure)
                     A timestamp, and a single numerical value, which together
                     represent a measurement at a particular point in time.

                     Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                        The time, in epoch format, associated with a  particu-
                        lar Value .

                     Value -> (double)
                        The  actual  value  associated with a particular Time-
                        stamp .

       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter  is  specified,  the response includes only records beyond
          the token, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
