OPTIONS

       --request-payer (string) Confirms that the requester  knows  that  they

       matches the specified pattern.

       --only-show-errors (boolean) Only errors and  warnings  are  displayed.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: Delete an S3 object

       The following rm command deletes a single s3 object:

          aws s3 rm s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Output:

          delete: s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Example 2: Delete all contents in a bucket

       The following rm command recursively deletes all objects under a speci-
       fied  bucket and prefix when passed with the parameter --recursive.  In
       this example, the bucket mybucket contains the  objects  test1.txt  and
       test2.txt:

          aws s3 rm s3://mybucket \
              --recursive

       Output:

          delete: s3://mybucket/test1.txt
          delete: s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Example 3: Delete all contents in a bucket, except ``.jpg`` files

       The following rm command recursively deletes all objects under a speci-
       fied bucket and prefix when passed with the parameter --recursive while
       excluding  some objects by using an --exclude parameter.  In this exam-
       ple, the bucket mybucket has the objects test1.txt and test2.jpg:

          aws s3 rm s3://mybucket/ \
              --recursive \
              --exclude "*.jpg"

       Output:

          delete: s3://mybucket/test1.txt

       Example 4: Delete all contents in a bucket, except  objects  under  the
       specified prefix

       The following rm command recursively deletes all objects under a speci-
       fied bucket and prefix when passed with the parameter --recursive while
       excluding  all  objects under a particular prefix by using an --exclude
       parameter.  In this  example,  the  bucket  mybucket  has  the  objects
       test1.txt and another/test.txt:

          aws s3 rm s3://mybucket/ \
              --recursive \
              --exclude "another/*"

       Output:

          delete: s3://mybucket/test1.txt

       Example 5: Delete an object from an S3 access point

       The  following  rm command deletes a single object (mykey) from the ac-
       cess point (myaccesspoint). :: The following rm command deletes a  sin-
       gle object (mykey) from the access point (myaccesspoint).

          aws s3 rm s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey

       Output:

          delete: s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey



                                                                          RM()
