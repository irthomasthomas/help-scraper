       dex.html  and  you make a request to samplebucket/images/ the data that

       The suffix must not be empty and must not include a slash character.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Configure an S3 bucket as a static website

       The  following  command configures a bucket named my-bucket as a static
       website. The index document option specifies the file in my-bucket that
       visitors  will be directed to when they navigate to the website URL. In
       this case, the bucket is in the us-west-2 region, so the site would ap-
       pear at http://my-bucket.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com.

       All  files in the bucket that appear on the static site must be config-
       ured to allow visitors to open them. File  permissions  are  configured
       separately from the bucket website configuration.

          aws s3 website s3://my-bucket/ \
              --index-document index.html \
              --error-document error.html

       Static Website in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
