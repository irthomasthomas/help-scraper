EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI

       Example 1: To create a pre-signed URL with the default one  hour  life-
       time that links to an object in an S3 bucket

       The  following  presign command generates a pre-signed URL for a speci-
       fied bucket and key that is valid for one hour.

          aws s3 presign s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test2.txt

       Output:

          https://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/key?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAEXAMPLE123456789%2F20210621%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20210621T041609Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=EXAMBLE1234494d5fba3fed607f98018e1dfc62e2529ae96d844123456

       Example 2: To create a pre-signed URL with a custom lifetime that links
       to an object in an S3 bucket

       The  following  presign command generates a pre-signed URL for a speci-
       fied bucket and key that is valid for one week.

          aws s3 presign s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test2.txt \
              --expires-in 604800

       Output:

          https://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/key?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAEXAMPLE123456789%2F20210621%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20210621T041609Z&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=EXAMBLE1234494d5fba3fed607f98018e1dfc62e2529ae96d844123456
