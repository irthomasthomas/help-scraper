MV()                                                                      MV()



NAME
       mv -

DESCRIPTION
       Moves  a  local file or S3 object to another location locally or in S3.
       The mv command copies the source object or file to the specified desti-
       nation and then deletes the source object or file.

       WARNING:
          If  you  are  using  any  type  of access point ARNs or access point
          aliases in your S3 URIs, you must take extra care to make sure  that
          your  source and destination S3 URIs resolve to different underlying
          buckets. If the source and destination buckets  are  the  same,  the
          source  file or object can be moved onto itself, which can result in
          accidental deletion of your source file or object.

          To verify that the source and destination buckets are not the  same,
          use  the  --validate-same-s3-paths parameter, or set the environment
          variable AWS_CLI_S3_MV_VALIDATE_SAME_S3_PATHS to true.

OPTIONS
       paths (string)

       --dryrun (boolean) Displays the operations that would be performed  us-
       ing the specified command without actually running them.

       --quiet  (boolean)  Does  not display the operations performed from the
       specified command.

       --include (string) Don't exclude files or objects in the  command  that
       match the specified pattern. See Use of Exclude and Include Filters for
       details.

       --exclude (string) Exclude all files or objects from the  command  that
       matches the specified pattern.

       --acl  (string)  Sets  the  ACL for the object when the command is per-
       formed. If you use this parameter you must have  the  "s3:PutObjectAcl"
       permission  included  in  the list of actions for your IAM policy. Only
       accepts values of private,  public-read,  public-read-write,  authenti-
       cated-read, aws-exec-read, bucket-owner-read, bucket-owner-full-control
       and log-delivery-write. See Canned ACL for details

       --follow-symlinks | --no-follow-symlinks (boolean) Symbolic  links  are
       followed only when uploading to S3 from the local filesystem. Note that
       S3 does not support symbolic links, so the contents of the link  target
       are uploaded under the name of the link. When neither --follow-symlinks
       nor --no-follow-symlinks is specified, the default is  to  follow  sym-
       links.

       --no-guess-mime-type  (boolean)  Do  not try to guess the mime type for
       uploaded files. By default the mime type of a file is guessed  when  it
       is uploaded.

       --sse  (string)  Specifies  server-side encryption of the object in S3.
       Valid values are AES256 and aws:kms. If the parameter is specified  but
       no value is provided, AES256 is used.

       --sse-c  (string)  Specifies server-side encryption using customer pro-
       vided keys of the the object in S3. AES256 is the only valid value.  If
       the parameter is specified but no value is provided, AES256 is used. If
       you provide this value, --sse-c-key must be specified as well.

       --sse-c-key (blob) The  customer-provided  encryption  key  to  use  to
       server-side  encrypt  the  object  in  S3.  If  you provide this value,
       --sse-c must be specified as well.  The  key  provided  should  not  be
       base64 encoded.

       --sse-kms-key-id  (string) The customer-managed AWS Key Management Ser-
       vice (KMS) key ID that should be used to server-side encrypt the object
       in  S3.  You should only provide this parameter if you are using a cus-
       tomer managed customer master key (CMK) and not  the  AWS  managed  KMS
       CMK.

       --sse-c-copy-source  (string)  This  parameter should only be specified
       when copying an S3 object that was encrypted server-side  with  a  cus-
       tomer-provided  key.  It specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting
       the source object. AES256 is the only valid value. If the parameter  is
       specified but no value is provided, AES256 is used. If you provide this
       value, --sse-c-copy-source-key must be specified as well.

       --sse-c-copy-source-key (blob) This parameter should only be  specified
       when  copying  an  S3 object that was encrypted server-side with a cus-
       tomer-provided key. Specifies the customer-provided encryption key  for
       Amazon  S3 to use to decrypt the source object. The encryption key pro-
       vided must be one that was used when the source object was created.  If
       you  provide  this value, --sse-c-copy-source be specified as well. The
       key provided should not be base64 encoded.

       --storage-class (string) The type of storage to  use  for  the  object.
       Valid  choices  are: STANDARD | REDUCED_REDUNDANCY | STANDARD_IA | ONE-
       ZONE_IA | INTELLIGENT_TIERING | GLACIER |  DEEP_ARCHIVE  |  GLACIER_IR.
       Defaults to 'STANDARD'

       --grants (string)
          Grant  specific  permissions  to individual users or groups. You can
          supply a list of grants of the form

              --grants Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID [Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID ...]

          To specify the same permission type for multiple  grantees,  specify
          the permission as such as

              --grants Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID,Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID,...

          Each value contains the following elements:

          o Permission  - Specifies the granted permissions, and can be set to
            read, readacl, writeacl, or full.

          o Grantee_Type - Specifies how the grantee is to be identified,  and
            can be set to uri or id.

          o Grantee_ID  -  Specifies  the  grantee  based on Grantee_Type. The
            Grantee_ID value can be one of:

            o uri - The group's URI.  For  more  information,  see  Who  Is  a
              Grantee?

            o id - The account's canonical ID

          For more information on Amazon S3 access control, see Access Control

       --website-redirect  (string)  If the bucket is configured as a website,
       redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket
       or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the
       object metadata.

       --content-type (string) Specify an explicit content type for this oper-
       ation. This value overrides any guessed mime types.

       --cache-control  (string)  Specifies  caching  behavior  along  the re-
       quest/reply chain.

       --content-disposition (string) Specifies presentational information for
       the object.

       --content-encoding  (string) Specifies what content encodings have been
       applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied
       to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

       --content-language (string) The language the content is in.

       --expires  (string)  The date and time at which the object is no longer
       cacheable.

       --source-region (string) When transferring objects from an s3 bucket to
       an  s3 bucket, this specifies the region of the source bucket. Note the
       region specified by --region or through configuration of the CLI refers
       to  the  region  of  the  destination bucket. If --source-region is not
       specified the region of the source will be the same as  the  region  of
       the destination bucket.

       --only-show-errors  (boolean)  Only  errors and warnings are displayed.
       All other output is suppressed.

       --no-progress (boolean) File transfer progress is not  displayed.  This
       flag  is only applied when the quiet and only-show-errors flags are not
       provided.

       --page-size (integer) The number of results to return in each  response
       to  a  list operation. The default value is 1000 (the maximum allowed).
       Using a lower value may help if an operation times out.

       --ignore-glacier-warnings (boolean) Turns off glacier  warnings.  Warn-
       ings  about  an  operation that cannot be performed because it involves
       copying, downloading, or moving a glacier  object  will  no  longer  be
       printed  to  standard error and will no longer cause the return code of
       the command to be 2.

       --force-glacier-transfer (boolean) Forces a  transfer  request  on  all
       Glacier objects in a sync or recursive copy.

       --request-payer  (string)  Confirms  that the requester knows that they
       will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need  not  specify  this
       parameter  in their requests. Documentation on downloading objects from
       requester      pays      buckets      can       be       found       at
       http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html

       --metadata (map) A map of metadata to store with  the  objects  in  S3.
       This  will be applied to every object which is part of this request. In
       a sync, this means that files which haven't changed won't  receive  the
       new  metadata.  When copying between two s3 locations, the metadata-di-
       rective argument will default  to  'REPLACE'  unless  otherwise  speci-
       fied.key -> (string)
          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --metadata-directive  (string) Specifies whether the metadata is copied
       from the source object or replaced with metadata provided when  copying
       S3 objects. Note that if the object is copied over in parts, the source
       object's metadata will not be copied over,  no  matter  the  value  for
       --metadata-directive,  and  instead the desired metadata values must be
       specified as parameters on the command line. Valid values are COPY  and
       REPLACE.  If  this parameter is not specified, COPY will be used by de-
       fault. If REPLACE is used, the copied object will only have  the  meta-
       data  values  that  were specified by the CLI command. Note that if you
       are using any of the following parameters: --content-type, content-lan-
       guage,  --content-encoding,  --content-disposition, --cache-control, or
       --expires, you will need to specify  --metadata-directive  REPLACE  for
       non-multipart  copies if you want the copied objects to have the speci-
       fied metadata values.

       --recursive (boolean) Command is performed on all files or objects  un-
       der the specified directory or prefix.

       --validate-same-s3-paths  (boolean) Resolves the source and destination
       S3 URIs to their underlying buckets and verifies that the file  or  ob-
       ject  is  not being moved onto itself. If you are using any type of ac-
       cess point ARNs or access point aliases in your S3  URIs,  we  strongly
       recommended  using  this parameter to help prevent accidental deletions
       of the source file or object. This parameter  resolves  the  underlying
       buckets  of  S3  access  point  ARNs and aliases, S3 on Outposts access
       point ARNs, and Multi-Region Access Point ARNs. S3 on  Outposts  access
       point  aliases  are not supported. Instead of using this parameter, you
       can set the environment  variable  AWS_CLI_S3_MV_VALIDATE_SAME_S3_PATHS
       to  true.  NOTE:  Path validation requires making additional API calls.
       Future updates to this path-validation mechanism might change which API
       calls are made.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: Move a local file to the specified bucket

       The  following mv command moves a single file to a specified bucket and
       key.

          aws s3 mv test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Output:

          move: test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Example 2: Move an object to the specified bucket and key

       The following mv command moves a single s3 object to a specified bucket
       and key.

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Example 3: Move an S3 object to the local directory

       The  following mv command moves a single object to a specified file lo-
       cally.

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt test2.txt

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to test2.txt

       Example 4: Move an object with it's  original  name  to  the  specified
       bucket

       The  following  mv  command moves a single object to a specified bucket
       while retaining its original name:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket2/

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket2/test.txt

       Example 5: Move all objects and prefixes in a bucket to the  local  di-
       rectory

       When  passed  with  the parameter --recursive, the following mv command
       recursively moves all objects under a specified prefix and bucket to  a
       specified  directory.  In this example, the bucket mybucket has the ob-
       jects test1.txt and test2.txt.

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket . \
              --recursive

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test1.txt to test1.txt
          move: s3://mybucket/test2.txt to test2.txt

       Example 6: Move all objects and prefixes in a bucket to the  local  di-
       rectory, except ``.jpg`` files

       When  passed  with  the parameter --recursive, the following mv command
       recursively moves all files under a specified directory to a  specified
       bucket  and prefix while excluding some files by using an --exclude pa-
       rameter. In this example, the directory myDir has the  files  test1.txt
       and test2.jpg.

          aws s3 mv myDir s3://mybucket/ \
              --recursive \

       Example  7:  Move all objects and prefixes in a bucket to the local di-
       rectory, except specified prefix

       When passed with the parameter --recursive, the  following  mv  command
       recursively  moves  all  objects  under  a  specified bucket to another
       bucket while excluding some objects by using  an  --exclude  parameter.
       In  this example, the bucket mybucket has the objects test1.txt and an-
       other/test1.txt.

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/ s3://mybucket2/ \
              --recursive \
              --exclude "mybucket/another/*"

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test1.txt to s3://mybucket2/test1.txt

       Example 8: Move an object to the specified bucket and set the ACL

       The following mv command moves a single object to  a  specified  bucket
       and key while setting the ACL to public-read-write.

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt \
              --acl public-read-write

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Example  9: Move a local file to the specified bucket and grant permis-
       sions

       The following mv command illustrates the use of the --grants option  to
       grant  read  access  to  all  users and full control to a specific user
       identified by their email address.

          aws s3 mv file.txt s3://mybucket/ \
              --grants read=uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers full=emailaddress=user@example.com

       Output:

          move: file.txt to s3://mybucket/file.txt

       Example 10: Move a file to an S3 access point

       The following mv command moves a single file named mydoc.txt to the ac-
       cess point named myaccesspoint at the key named mykey.

          aws s3 mv mydoc.txt s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey

       Output:

          move: mydoc.txt to s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey



                                                                          MV()
