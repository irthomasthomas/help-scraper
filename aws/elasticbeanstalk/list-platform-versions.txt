LIST-PLATFORM-VERSIONS()                              LIST-PLATFORM-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-platform-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  platform  versions available for your account in an AWS Re-
       gion. Provides summary information about each platform version. Compare
       to   DescribePlatformVersion , which provides full details about a sin-
       gle platform version.

       For definitions of platform version and other  platform-related  terms,
       see AWS Elastic Beanstalk Platforms Glossary .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-platform-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PlatformSummaryList

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Criteria for restricting the resulting list  of  platform  versions.
          The filter is interpreted as a logical conjunction (AND) of the sep-
          arate PlatformFilter terms.

          (structure)
              Describes criteria to restrict the results when listing platform
              versions.

              The filter is evaluated as follows: Type Operator Values[1]

              Type -> (string)
                 The platform version attribute to which the filter values are
                 applied.

                 Valid values: PlatformName | PlatformVersion | PlatformStatus
                 | PlatformBranchName | PlatformLifecycleState | PlatformOwner
                 | SupportedTier | SupportedAddon | ProgrammingLanguageName  |
                 OperatingSystemName

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator to apply to the Type with each of the Values .

                 Valid  values:  =  |  !=  |  < | <= | > | >= | contains | be-
                 gins_with | ends_with

              Values -> (list)
                 The list of values applied to the filtering platform  version
                 attribute. Only one value is supported for all current opera-
                 tors.

                 The following list shows valid filter values for some  filter
                 attributes.

                 o PlatformStatus  :  Creating  |  Failed | Ready | Deleting |
                   Deleted

                 o PlatformLifecycleState : recommended

                 o SupportedTier : WebServer/Standard | Worker/SQS/HTTP

                 o SupportedAddon : Log/S3 | Monitoring/Healthd  |  WorkerDae-
                   mon/SQSD

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Operator=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "string",
              "Operator": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
