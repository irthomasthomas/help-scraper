ENVIRONMENT-UPDATED()                                    ENVIRONMENT-UPDATED()



NAME
       environment-updated -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until  JMESPath query Environments[].Status returns Ready for all
       elements when polling with describe-environments. It will poll every 20
       seconds  until a successful state has been reached. This will exit with
       a return code of 255 after 20 failed checks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       environment-updated is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Environments

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to include only those that are associated with  this  applica-
          tion.

       --version-label (string)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to include only those that are associated with  this  applica-
          tion version.

       --environment-ids (list)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to include only those that have the specified IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --environment-names (list)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions to include only those that have the specified names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-deleted | --no-include-deleted (boolean)
          Indicates whether to include deleted environments:
              true  : Environments that have been deleted after IncludedDelet-
              edBackTo are displayed.

              false : Do not include deleted environments.

       --included-deleted-back-to (timestamp)
          If specified when IncludeDeleted is set to true , then  environments
          deleted after this date are displayed.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
