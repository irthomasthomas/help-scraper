OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Criteria  for  restricting  the resulting list of platform branches.
          The filter is evaluated as a logical conjunction (AND) of the  sepa-
          rate SearchFilter terms.

          The  following  list  shows  valid  attribute values for each of the
          SearchFilter terms. Most operators take a single value. The  in  and
          not_in operators can take multiple values.

          o Attribute = BranchName :

            o Operator  :  =  | != | begins_with | ends_with | contains | in |
              not_in

          o Attribute = LifecycleState :

            o Operator : = | != | in | not_in

            o Values : beta | supported | deprecated | retired

          o Attribute = PlatformName :

            o Operator : = | != | begins_with | ends_with | contains  |  in  |
              not_in

          o Attribute = TierType :

            o Operator : = | !=

            o Values : WebServer/Standard | Worker/SQS/HTTP

          Array size: limited to 10 SearchFilter objects.

          Within  each  SearchFilter  item,  the Values array is limited to 10
          items.

          (structure)
              Describes criteria to restrict a list of results.

              For operators that apply a single value to  the  attribute,  the
              filter is evaluated as follows: Attribute Operator Values[1]

              Some  operators,  e.g.  in  , can apply multiple values. In this
              case, the filter is evaluated as a logical union (OR) of  appli-
              cations  of  the  operator to the attribute with each one of the
              values: (Attribute Operator Values[1])  OR  (Attribute  Operator
              Values[2]) OR ...

              The  valid  values  for attributes of SearchFilter depend on the
              API action. For valid values, see the reference page for the API
              action you're calling that takes a SearchFilter parameter.

              Attribute -> (string)
                 The  result attribute to which the filter values are applied.
                 Valid values vary by API action.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator to apply to the Attribute with each of the  Val-
                 ues . Valid values vary by Attribute .

              Values -> (list)
                 The  list of values applied to the Attribute and Operator at-
                 tributes. Number of values and valid values vary by Attribute
                 .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Attribute=string,Operator=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Attribute": "string",
              "Operator": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of platform branch values returned in one call.

       --next-token (string)
          For  a  paginated  request. Specify a token from a previous response
          page to retrieve the next response page. All other parameter  values
          must be identical to the ones specified in the initial request.

          If no NextToken is specified, the first page is retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       PlatformBranchSummaryList -> (list)
          Summary information about the platform branches.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a platform branch.

              PlatformName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the platform to which this platform branch be-
                 longs.

              BranchName -> (string)
                 The name of the platform branch.

              LifecycleState -> (string)
                 The support life cycle state of the platform branch.

                 Possible values: beta | supported | deprecated | retired

              BranchOrder -> (integer)
                 An ordinal number that designates the order in which platform
                 branches  have been added to a platform. This can be helpful,
                 for example, if your code calls the ListPlatformBranches  ac-
                 tion and then displays a list of platform branches.

                 A larger BranchOrder value designates a newer platform branch
                 within the platform.

              SupportedTierList -> (list)
                 The environment tiers that platform versions in  this  branch
                 support.

                 Possible values: WebServer/Standard | Worker/SQS/HTTP

                 (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          In  a  paginated  request, if this value isn't null , it's the token
          that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the  next  response
          page.
