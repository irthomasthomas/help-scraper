OPTIONS
       --application-names (list)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to only include those with the specified names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Applications -> (list)
          This parameter contains a list of  ApplicationDescription .

          (structure)
              Describes the properties of an application.

              ApplicationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the application.

              ApplicationName -> (string)
                 The name of the application.

              Description -> (string)
                 User-defined description of the application.

              DateCreated -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the application was created.

              DateUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the application was last modified.

              Versions -> (list)
                 The names of the versions for this application.

                 (string)

              ConfigurationTemplates -> (list)
                 The names of the configuration templates associated with this
                 application.

                 (string)

              ResourceLifecycleConfig -> (structure)
                 The lifecycle settings for the application.

                 ServiceRole -> (string)
                     The ARN of an IAM service role that Elastic Beanstalk has
                     permission to assume.

                     The ServiceRole property is required the first time  that
                     you  provide a VersionLifecycleConfig for the application
                     in one of the supporting calls (CreateApplication or  Up-
                     dateApplicationResourceLifecycle  ). After you provide it
                     once, in either one of the calls, Elastic Beanstalk  per-
                     sists  the  Service  Role  with  the application, and you
                     don't need to specify it again in subsequent UpdateAppli-
                     cationResourceLifecycle  calls. You can, however, specify
                     it in subsequent calls to change the Service Role to  an-
                     other value.

                 VersionLifecycleConfig -> (structure)
                     Defines lifecycle settings for application versions.

                     MaxCountRule -> (structure)
                        Specify a max count rule to restrict the number of ap-
                        plication versions that are retained for  an  applica-
                        tion.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Specify  true  to apply the rule, or false to dis-
                            able it.

                        MaxCount -> (integer)
                            Specify the maximum number of application versions
                            to retain.

                        DeleteSourceFromS3 -> (boolean)
                            Set  to  true  to delete a version's source bundle
                            from Amazon S3 when Elastic Beanstalk deletes  the
                            application version.

                     MaxAgeRule -> (structure)
                        Specify  a max age rule to restrict the length of time
                        that application versions are retained for an applica-
                        tion.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Specify  true  to apply the rule, or false to dis-
                            able it.

                        MaxAgeInDays -> (integer)
                            Specify the number of days to retain  an  applica-
                            tion versions.

                        DeleteSourceFromS3 -> (boolean)
                            Set  to  true  to delete a version's source bundle
                            from Amazon S3 when Elastic Beanstalk deletes  the
                            application version.
