OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application. Must be unique within your account.

       --description (string)
          Your description of the application.

       --resource-lifecycle-config (structure)
          Specifies an application resource lifecycle configuration to prevent
          your application from accumulating too many versions.

          ServiceRole -> (string)
              The  ARN  of an IAM service role that Elastic Beanstalk has per-
              mission to assume.

              The ServiceRole property is required the  first  time  that  you
              provide  a  VersionLifecycleConfig for the application in one of
              the supporting calls (CreateApplication or  UpdateApplicationRe-
              sourceLifecycle  ).  After you provide it once, in either one of
              the calls, Elastic Beanstalk persists the Service Role with  the
              application,  and  you  don't need to specify it again in subse-
              quent UpdateApplicationResourceLifecycle calls.  You  can,  how-
              ever,  specify it in subsequent calls to change the Service Role
              to another value.

          VersionLifecycleConfig -> (structure)
              Defines lifecycle settings for application versions.

              MaxCountRule -> (structure)
                 Specify a max count rule to restrict the number  of  applica-
                 tion versions that are retained for an application.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Specify true to apply the rule, or false to disable it.

                 MaxCount -> (integer)
                     Specify the maximum number of application versions to re-
                     tain.

                 DeleteSourceFromS3 -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to delete a version's source bundle from Ama-
                     zon  S3  when  Elastic  Beanstalk deletes the application
                     version.

              MaxAgeRule -> (structure)
                 Specify a max age rule to restrict the length  of  time  that
                 application versions are retained for an application.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Specify true to apply the rule, or false to disable it.

                 MaxAgeInDays -> (integer)
                     Specify  the number of days to retain an application ver-
                     sions.

                 DeleteSourceFromS3 -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to delete a version's source bundle from Ama-
                     zon  S3  when  Elastic  Beanstalk deletes the application
                     version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ServiceRole=string,VersionLifecycleConfig={MaxCountRule={Enabled=boolean,MaxCount=integer,DeleteSourceFromS3=boolean},MaxAgeRule={Enabled=boolean,MaxAgeInDays=integer,DeleteSourceFromS3=boolean}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ServiceRole": "string",
            "VersionLifecycleConfig": {
              "MaxCountRule": {
                "Enabled": true|false,
                "MaxCount": integer,
                "DeleteSourceFromS3": true|false
              },
              "MaxAgeRule": {
                "Enabled": true|false,
                "MaxAgeInDays": integer,
                "DeleteSourceFromS3": true|false
              }
            }
          }

       --tags (list)
          Specifies the tags applied to the application.

          Elastic Beanstalk applies these tags only to the application.  Envi-
          ronments that you create in the application don't inherit the tags.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag applied to a resource in an environment.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a new application

       The following command creates a new application named "MyApp":

          aws elasticbeanstalk create-application --application-name MyApp --description "my application"

       The  create-application  command only configures the application's name
       and description. To upload source code for the application,  create  an
       initial  version  of  the application using create-application-version.
       create-application-version also has an  auto-create-application  option
       that lets you create the application and the application version in one
       step.

       Output:

          {
            "Application": {
                "ApplicationName": "MyApp",
                "ConfigurationTemplates": [],
                "DateUpdated": "2015-02-12T18:32:21.181Z",
                "Description": "my application",
                "DateCreated": "2015-02-12T18:32:21.181Z"
            }
