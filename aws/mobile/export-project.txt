EXPORT-PROJECT()                                              EXPORT-PROJECT()



NAME
       export-project -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports project configuration to a snapshot which can be downloaded and
       shared. Note that mobile app push credentials are encrypted in exported
       projects,  so  they can only be shared successfully within the same AWS
       account.

OPTIONS
       --project-id (string)
          Unique project identifier.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       downloadUrl -> (string)
          URL  which can be used to download the exported project configuation
          file(s).

       shareUrl -> (string)
          URL which can be shared to allow other AWS users to create their own
          project  in AWS Mobile Hub with the same configuration as the speci-
          fied project. This URL pertains to a snapshot in time of the project
          configuration  that  is created when this API is called. If you want
          to share additional changes to your project configuration, then  you
          will  need to create and share a new snapshot by calling this method
          again.

       snapshotId -> (string)
          Unique identifier for the exported snapshot of the project  configu-
          ration. This snapshot identifier is included in the share URL.
