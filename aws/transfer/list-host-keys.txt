OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of host keys to return.

       --next-token (string)
          When there are additional results that were not returned, a  NextTo-
          ken  parameter  is returned. You can use that value for a subsequent
          call to ListHostKeys to continue listing results.

       --server-id (string)
          Provide the ID of the server that contains the host  keys  that  you
          want to view.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          Returns a token that you can use to call ListHostKeys again and  re-
          ceive additional results, if there are any.

       ServerId -> (string)
          Returns the server ID that contains the listed host keys.

       HostKeys -> (list)
          Returns  an  array,  where  each item contains the details of a host
          key.

          (structure)
              Returns properties of the host key that is specified.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  host
                 key.

              HostKeyId -> (string)

              Fingerprint -> (string)
                 The  public  key  fingerprint,  which  is a short sequence of
                 bytes used to identify the longer public key.

              Description -> (string)
                 The current description for the host key. You can  change  it
                 by  calling  the  UpdateHostKey operation and providing a new
                 description.

              Type -> (string)
                 The encryption algorithm used for the host key. The  Type  is
                 one of the following values:

                 o ssh-ed25519

                 o ecdsa-sha2-nistp256

                 o ecdsa-sha2-nistp384

                 o ecdsa-sha2-nistp521

              DateImported -> (timestamp)
                 The date on which the host key was added to the server.
