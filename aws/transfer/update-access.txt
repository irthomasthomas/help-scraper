OPTIONS
       --home-directory (string)
          The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log  in  to  the
          server using the client.

          A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

          NOTE:
              The HomeDirectory parameter is only used if HomeDirectoryType is
              set to LOGICAL .

       --home-directory-type (string)
          The type of landing directory (folder) that  you  want  your  users'
          home  directory  to be when they log in to the server. If you set it
          to PATH , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or  Amazon
          EFS  path  as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set
          it to LOGICAL , you need to provide  mappings  in  the  HomeDirecto-
          ryMappings  for  how  you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths
          visible to your users.

          NOTE:
              If HomeDirectoryType is LOGICAL , you must provide mappings, us-
              ing  the HomeDirectoryMappings parameter. If, on the other hand,
              HomeDirectoryType is PATH , you provide an absolute  path  using
              the  HomeDirectory parameter. You cannot have both HomeDirectory
              and HomeDirectoryMappings in your template.

          Possible values:

          o PATH

          o LOGICAL

       --home-directory-mappings (list)
          Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS
          paths  and  keys  should be visible to your user and how you want to
          make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where
          Entry  shows  how  the path is made visible and Target is the actual
          Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a  target,  it  is
          displayed  as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access
          Management (IAM) role provides access to  paths  in  Target  .  This
          value can be set only when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL .

          The following is an Entry and Target pair example.
              [  {  "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydi-
              rectory" } ]

          In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session  policy
          to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("chroot ").
          To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the  HomeDirec-
          tory parameter value.

          The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .
              [ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]

          (structure)
              Represents an object that contains entries and targets for Home-
              DirectoryMappings .

              The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .
                 [ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" }
                 ]

              Entry -> (string)
                 Represents an entry for HomeDirectoryMappings .

              Target -> (string)
                 Represents  the  map  target  that  is used in a HomeDirecto-
                 rymapEntry .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Entry=string,Target=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Entry": "string",
              "Target": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --policy (string)
          A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity
          and  Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy
          scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon  S3  bucket.
          Variables  that  you  can  use  inside  this policy include ${Trans-
          fer:UserName} ,  ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}  ,  and  ${Transfer:Home-
          Bucket} .

          NOTE:
              This  policy  applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon
              S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies.

              For session policies, Transfer Family stores  the  policy  as  a
              JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pol-
              icy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the  Pol-
              icy argument.

              For an example of a session policy, see Example session policy .

              For  more  information,  see  AssumeRole  in the Amazon Web Ser-
              vicesSecurity Token Service API Reference .

       --posix-profile (structure)
          The full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid ), group ID (Gid  ),
          and  any  secondary  groups IDs (SecondaryGids ), that controls your
          users' access to your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX permissions
          that  are set on files and directories in your file system determine
          the level of access your users get when transferring files into  and
          out of your Amazon EFS file systems.

          Uid -> (long)
              The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

          Gid -> (long)
              The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

          SecondaryGids -> (list)
              The  secondary  POSIX  group  IDs used for all EFS operations by
              this user.

              (long)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Uid=long,Gid=long,SecondaryGids=long,long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Uid": long,
            "Gid": long,
            "SecondaryGids": [long, ...]
          }

       --role (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket
          or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role deter-
          mine  the  level  of access that you want to provide your users when
          transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket  or  Amazon
          EFS  file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relation-
          ship that allows the server to access your resources when  servicing
          your users' transfer requests.

       --server-id (string)
          A  system-assigned  unique identifier for a server instance. This is
          the specific server that you added your user to.

       --external-id (string)
          A unique identifier that is required  to  identify  specific  groups
          within  your  directory.  The  users of the group that you associate
          have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over  the  en-
          abled  protocols  using Transfer Family. If you know the group name,
          you can view the SID values by running the following  command  using
          Windows PowerShell.
              Get-ADGroup  -Filter  {samAccountName -like "*YourGroupName* *"}
              -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid

          In that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your  Active
          Directory group.

          The  regular  expression used to validate this parameter is a string
          of characters consisting of  uppercase  and  lowercase  alphanumeric
          characters  with  no spaces. You can also include underscores or any
          of the following characters: =,.@:/-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
