START-DIRECTORY-LISTING()                            START-DIRECTORY-LISTING()



NAME
       start-directory-listing -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of  the  contents of a directory from a remote SFTP
       server. You specify the connector ID, the output path, and  the  remote
       directory  path.  You  can  also specify the optional MaxItems value to
       control the maximum number of items that are listed from the remote di-
       rectory.  This  API  returns a list of all files and directories in the
       remote directory (up to the maximum value), but does not  return  files
       or folders in sub-directories. That is, it only returns a list of files
       and directories one-level deep.

       After you receive the listing file, you can provide the files that  you
       want  to  transfer to the RetrieveFilePaths parameter of the StartFile-
       Transfer API call.

       The naming convention for the output file  is  ``  connector-ID  -list-
       ing-ID .json`` . The output file contains the following information:

       o filePath : the complete path of a remote file, relative to the direc-
         tory of the listing request for your SFTP  connector  on  the  remote
         server.

       o modifiedTimestamp  : the last time the file was modified, in UTC time
         format. This field is optional. If the remote file  attributes  don't
         contain a timestamp, it is omitted from the file listing.

       o size : the size of the file, in bytes. This field is optional. If the
         remote file attributes don't contain a file size, it is omitted  from
         the file listing.

       o path  :  the complete path of a remote directory, relative to the di-
         rectory of the listing request for your SFTP connector on the  remote
         server.

       o truncated : a flag indicating whether the list output contains all of
         the items contained in the remote directory or not. If your Truncated
         output  value is true, you can increase the value provided in the op-
         tional max-items input attribute to be able to list more items (up to
         the maximum allowed list size of 10,000 items).

OPTIONS
       --connector-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the connector.

       --remote-directory-path (string)
          Specifies the directory on the remote SFTP server for which you want
          to list its contents.

       --max-items (integer)
          An optional parameter where you can specify the  maximum  number  of
          file/directory names to retrieve. The default value is 1,000.

       --output-directory-path (string)
          Specifies the path (bucket and prefix) in Amazon S3 storage to store
          the results of the directory listing.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ListingId -> (string)
          Returns a unique identifier for the directory listing call.

       OutputFileName -> (string)
          Returns the file name where the results are stored. This is a combi-
          nation of the connector ID and the listing ID: <connector-id>-<list-
          ing-id>.json .
