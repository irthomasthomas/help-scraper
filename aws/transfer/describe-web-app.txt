OPTIONS
       --web-app-id (string)
          Provide the unique identifier for the web app.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       WebApp -> (structure)
          Returns a structure that contains the details of the web app.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web app.

          WebAppId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the web app.

          DescribedIdentityProviderDetails -> (tagged union structure)
              A  structure that contains the details for the identity provider
              used by the web app.

              NOTE:
                 This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the  following
                 top level keys can be set: IdentityCenterConfig.

              IdentityCenterConfig -> (structure)
                 Returns  a structure for your identity provider details. This
                 structure contains the instance ARN and role being  used  for
                 the web app.

                 ApplicationArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM Identity Cen-
                     ter application: this value is set automatically when you
                     create your web app.

                 InstanceArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM Identity Cen-
                     ter used for the web app.

                 Role -> (string)
                     The IAM role in IAM Identity Center used for the web app.

          AccessEndpoint -> (string)
              The AccessEndpoint is the URL that you provide to your users for
              them to interact with the Transfer Family web app. You can spec-
              ify a custom URL or use the default value.

          WebAppEndpoint -> (string)
              The WebAppEndpoint is the unique URL for  your  Transfer  Family
              web  app. This is the value that you use when you configure Ori-
              gins on CloudFront.

          WebAppUnits -> (tagged union structure)
              A union that contains the value for number of concurrent connec-
              tions or the user sessions on your web app.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following
                 top level keys can be set: Provisioned.

              Provisioned -> (integer)
                 An integer that represents the number of units for  your  de-
                 sired number of concurrent connections, or the number of user
                 sessions on your web app at the same time.

                 Each increment allows an additional 250 concurrent  sessions:
                 a value of 1 sets the number of concurrent sessions to 250; 2
                 sets a value of 500, and so on.

          Tags -> (list)
              Key-value pairs that can be used to group  and  search  for  web
              apps. Tags are metadata attached to web apps for any purpose.

              (structure)
                 Creates  a  key-value  pair for a specific resource. Tags are
                 metadata that you can use to search for and group a  resource
                 for  various  purposes. You can apply tags to servers, users,
                 and roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For  exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate a tag called Group and assign the values Research and Ac-
                 counting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                     Contains  one or more values that you assigned to the key
                     name you create.
