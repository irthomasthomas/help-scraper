OPTIONS
       --certificate-id (string)
          An  array of identifiers for the imported certificates. You use this
          identifier for working with profiles and partner profiles.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

OUTPUT
       Certificate -> (structure)
          The details for the specified certificate, returned as an object.

              The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the certificate.

          CertificateId -> (string)
              An array of identifiers for the imported certificates.  You  use
              this identifier for working with profiles and partner profiles.

          Usage -> (string)
              Specifies  how  this  certificate is used. It can be used in the

          Status -> (string)
              The certificate can be either ACTIVE , PENDING_ROTATION , or IN-
              ACTIVE  .  PENDING_ROTATION means that this certificate will re-
              place the current certificate when it expires.

          Certificate -> (string)
              The file name for the certificate.

          CertificateChain -> (string)
              The list of certificates that make up the chain for the certifi-
              cate.

          ActiveDate -> (timestamp)
              An optional date that specifies when the certificate becomes ac-
              tive.

          InactiveDate -> (timestamp)

              active.

          Serial -> (string)
              The serial number for the certificate.

          NotBeforeDate -> (timestamp)
              The earliest date that the certificate is valid.

          NotAfterDate -> (timestamp)
              The final date that the certificate is valid.

          Type -> (string)
              If  a  private  key  has been specified for the certificate, its
              type is CERTIFICATE_WITH_PRIVATE_KEY . If there  is  no  private
              key, the type is CERTIFICATE .

          Description -> (string)
              The name or description that's used to identity the certificate.

          Tags -> (list)
              Key-value  pairs  that  can be used to group and search for cer-
              tificates.

              (structure)
                 Creates a key-value pair for a specific  resource.  Tags  are
                 metadata  that you can use to search for and group a resource
                 for various purposes. You can apply tags to  servers,  users,
                 and  roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate a tag called Group and assign the values Research and Ac-
                 counting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains one or more values that you assigned to the  key
