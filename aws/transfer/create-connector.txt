CREATE-CONNECTOR()                                          CREATE-CONNECTOR()



NAME
       create-connector -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  the  connector,  which captures the parameters for an outbound
       connection for the AS2 protocol. The connector is required for  sending
       files  to  an externally hosted AS2 server. For more details about con-
       nectors, see Create AS2 connectors .

OPTIONS
       --url (string)
          The URL of the partner's AS2 endpoint.

       --as2-config (structure)
          A structure that contains the parameters for a connector object.

          LocalProfileId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the AS2 local profile.

          PartnerProfileId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the partner profile for the connector.

          MessageSubject -> (string)
              Used as the Subject HTTP header attribute in AS2  messages  that
              are being sent with the connector.

          Compression -> (string)
              Specifies whether the AS2 file is compressed.

          EncryptionAlgorithm -> (string)
              The algorithm that is used to encrypt the file.

              NOTE:
                 You  can only specify NONE if the URL for your connector uses
                 HTTPS. This ensures that no traffic is sent in clear text.

          SigningAlgorithm -> (string)
              The algorithm that is used to sign the AS2  messages  sent  with
              the connector.

          MdnSigningAlgorithm -> (string)
              The signing algorithm for the MDN response.

              NOTE:
                 If  set  to  DEFAULT  (or  not  set  at  all),  the value for
                 SigningAlgorithm is used.

          MdnResponse -> (string)
              Used for outbound requests (from an Transfer Family server to  a
              partner  AS2  server)  to determine whether the partner response
              for transfers is synchronous or asynchronous. Specify either  of
              the following values:

              o SYNC : The system expects a synchronous MDN response, confirm-
                ing that the file was transferred successfully (or not).

              o NONE : Specifies that no MDN response is required.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LocalProfileId=string,PartnerProfileId=string,MessageSubject=string,Compression=string,EncryptionAlgorithm=string,SigningAlgorithm=string,MdnSigningAlgorithm=string,MdnResponse=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LocalProfileId": "string",
            "PartnerProfileId": "string",
            "MessageSubject": "string",
            "Compression": "ZLIB"|"DISABLED",
            "EncryptionAlgorithm": "AES128_CBC"|"AES192_CBC"|"AES256_CBC"|"NONE",
            "SigningAlgorithm": "SHA256"|"SHA384"|"SHA512"|"SHA1"|"NONE",
            "MdnSigningAlgorithm": "SHA256"|"SHA384"|"SHA512"|"SHA1"|"NONE"|"DEFAULT",
            "MdnResponse": "SYNC"|"NONE"
          }

       --access-role (string)
          With AS2, you can send files by calling StartFileTransfer and speci-
          fying  the  file  paths in the request parameter, SendFilePaths . We
          use the files parent directory (for example,  for  --send-file-paths
          /bucket/dir/file.txt  , parent directory is /bucket/dir/ ) to tempo-
          rarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we re-
          ceive  them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing
          relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the AccessRole  needs  to
          provide  read  and  write access to the parent directory of the file
          location used in the StartFileTransfer  request.  Additionally,  you
          need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the
          files that you intend to send with StartFileTransfer .

       --logging-role (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that allows a connector to turn on CloudWatch logging for
          Amazon S3 events. When set, you can view connector activity in  your
          CloudWatch logs.

       --tags (list)
          Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for connectors.
          Tags are metadata attached to connectors for any purpose.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data  that  you  can  use to search for and group a resource for
              various purposes. You can apply  tags  to  servers,  users,  and
              roles.  A  tag key can take more than one value. For example, to
              group servers for accounting purposes, you might  create  a  tag
              called  Group  and  assign the values Research and Accounting to
              that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 you create.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ConnectorId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the connector, returned after the API call
          succeeds.
