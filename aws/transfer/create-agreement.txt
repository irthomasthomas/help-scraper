CREATE-AGREEMENT()                                          CREATE-AGREEMENT()



NAME
       create-agreement -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  agreement.  An  agreement  is  a bilateral trading partner
       agreement, or partnership, between an Transfer Family server and an AS2
       process.  The agreement defines the file and message transfer relation-
       ship between the server and the AS2 process. To  define  an  agreement,
       Transfer Family combines a server, local profile, partner profile, cer-
       tificate, and other attributes.

       The partner is identified with  the  PartnerProfileId  ,  and  the  AS2
       process is identified with the LocalProfileId .

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A name or short description to identify the agreement.

       --server-id (string)
          A  system-assigned  unique identifier for a server instance. This is
          the specific server that the agreement uses.

       --local-profile-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the AS2 local profile.

       --partner-profile-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the partner profile used in the agreement.

       --base-directory (string)
          The landing directory (folder) for files transferred  by  using  the
          AS2 protocol.

          A BaseDirectory example is /DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/home/mydirectory .

       --access-role (string)
          With AS2, you can send files by calling StartFileTransfer and speci-
          fying the file paths in the request parameter,  SendFilePaths  .  We
          use  the  files parent directory (for example, for --send-file-paths
          /bucket/dir/file.txt , parent directory is /bucket/dir/ ) to  tempo-
          rarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we re-
          ceive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file  containing
          relevant  metadata  of the transmission. So, the AccessRole needs to
          provide read and write access to the parent directory  of  the  file
          location  used  in  the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally, you
          need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the
          files that you intend to send with StartFileTransfer .

       --status (string)
          The  status  of the agreement. The agreement can be either ACTIVE or
          INACTIVE .

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

       --tags (list)
          Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for agreements.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data  that  you  can  use to search for and group a resource for
              various purposes. You can apply  tags  to  servers,  users,  and
              roles.  A  tag key can take more than one value. For example, to
              group servers for accounting purposes, you might  create  a  tag
              called  Group  and  assign the values Research and Accounting to
              that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 you create.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AgreementId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the agreement. Use this ID  for  deleting,
          or updating an agreement, as well as in any other API calls that re-
          quire that you specify the agreement ID.
