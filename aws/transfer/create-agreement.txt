NAME
       create-agreement -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  agreement.  An  agreement  is  a bilateral trading partner
       agreement, or partnership, between an Transfer Family server and an AS2
       process.  The agreement defines the file and message transfer relation-
       ship between the server and the AS2 process. To  define  an  agreement,
       Transfer Family combines a server, local profile, partner profile, cer-
       tificate, and other attributes.

       The partner is identified with  the  PartnerProfileId  ,  and  the  AS2
       process is identified with the LocalProfileId .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 91)

       --access-role (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that grants access to at least the HomeDirectory of  your
          users' Amazon S3 buckets.

       --status (string)
          The  status  of the agreement. The agreement can be either ACTIVE or
          INACTIVE .

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

       --tags (list)
          Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for agreements.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data  that  you  can  use to search for and group a resource for
              various purposes. You can apply  tags  to  servers,  users,  and
              roles.  A  tag key can take more than one value. For example, to
              group servers for accounting purposes, you might  create  a  tag
              called  Group  and  assign the values Research and Accounting to
              that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 you create.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AgreementId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the agreement. Use this ID  for  deleting,
          or updating an agreement, as well as in any other API calls that re-
          quire that you specify the agreement ID.
