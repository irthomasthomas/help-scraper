DESCRIBE-ACCESS()                                            DESCRIBE-ACCESS()



NAME
       describe-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  access  that  is assigned to the specific file transfer
       protocol-enabled server, as identified by its ServerId property and its
       ExternalId .

       The  response  from this call returns the properties of the access that
       is associated with the ServerId value that was specified.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-access
          --server-id <value>
          --external-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has  this  ac-
          cess assigned.

       --external-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  that  is required to identify specific groups
          within your directory. The users of the  group  that  you  associate
          have  access  to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the en-
          abled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the  group  name,
          you  can  view the SID values by running the following command using
          Windows PowerShell.
              Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like  "*YourGroupName*  *"}
              -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid

          In  that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your Active
          Directory group.

          The regular expression used to validate this parameter is  a  string
          of  characters  consisting  of  uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric
          characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores  or  any
          of the following characters: =,.@:/-

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ServerId -> (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has  this  ac-
          cess assigned.

       Access -> (structure)
          The external ID of the server that the access is attached to.

          HomeDirectory -> (string)
              The  landing  directory  (folder) for a user when they log in to
              the server using the client.

              A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

          HomeDirectoryMappings -> (list)
              Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon
              EFS  paths  and  keys should be visible to your user and how you
              want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target
              pair,  where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target
              is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only  specify
              a  target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your
              Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role  provides  access  to
              paths in Target . This value can be set only when HomeDirectory-
              Type is set to LOGICAL .

              In most cases, you can use this value  instead  of  the  session
              policy to lock down the associated access to the designated home
              directory ("chroot "). To do this, you can set Entry to '/'  and
              set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value.

              (structure)
                 Represents  an  object  that contains entries and targets for
                 HomeDirectoryMappings .

                 The following is an Entry and Target pair example for  chroot
                 .
                     [  {  "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirec-
                     tory" } ]

                 Entry -> (string)
                     Represents an entry for HomeDirectoryMappings .

                 Target -> (string)
                     Represents the map target that is used in a  HomeDirecto-
                     rymapEntry .

          HomeDirectoryType -> (string)
              The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users'
              home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you  set
              it  to PATH , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or
              EFS paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If  you
              set  it LOGICAL , you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirec-
              toryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3  or  Amazon  EFS
              paths visible to your users.

          Policy -> (string)
              A  session  policy  for  your  user so that you can use the same
              Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users.
              This  policy  scopes  down  a user's access to portions of their
              Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this  policy
              include  ${Transfer:UserName}  , ${Transfer:HomeDirectory} , and
              ${Transfer:HomeBucket} .

          PosixProfile -> (structure)
              The full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid ), group ID (Gid
              ),  and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids ), that controls
              your users' access to your Amazon EFS file  systems.  The  POSIX
              permissions  that  are set on files and directories in your file
              system determine the level of access your users get when  trans-
              ferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.

              Uid -> (long)
                 The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

              Gid -> (long)
                 The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

              SecondaryGids -> (list)
                 The  secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by
                 this user.

                 (long)

          Role -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and  Access  Man-
              agement (IAM) role that controls your users' access to your Ama-
              zon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The  policies  attached
              to this role determine the level of access that you want to pro-
              vide your users when transferring files into  and  out  of  your
              Amazon  S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should
              also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to  ac-
              cess  your  resources  when  servicing  your users' transfer re-
              quests.

          ExternalId -> (string)
              A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups
              within your directory. The users of the group that you associate
              have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources  over  the
              enabled  protocols  using Transfer Family. If you know the group
              name, you can view the SID values by running the following  com-
              mand using Windows PowerShell.
                 Get-ADGroup  -Filter  {samAccountName  -like "*YourGroupName*
                 *"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid

              In that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your Ac-
              tive Directory group.

              The  regular  expression  used  to  validate this parameter is a
              string of characters consisting of uppercase and  lowercase  al-
              phanumeric  characters  with no spaces. You can also include un-
              derscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-
