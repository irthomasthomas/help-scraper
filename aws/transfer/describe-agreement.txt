OPTIONS
       --agreement-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the agreement. This identifier is returned
          when you create an agreement.

       --server-id (string)
          The server identifier that's associated with the agreement.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Agreement -> (structure)
          The  details  for the specified agreement, returned as a DescribedA-
          greement object.

          Arn -> (string)
              The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the agreement.

          AgreementId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the agreement. This  identifier  is  re-
              turned when you create an agreement.

          Description -> (string)
              The name or short description that's used to identify the agree-
              ment.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the agreement, either ACTIVE or INACTIVE .

          ServerId -> (string)
              A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance.  This
              identifier  indicates  the  specific  server  that the agreement
              uses.

          LocalProfileId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the AS2 local profile.

          PartnerProfileId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the partner profile used in  the  agree-
              ment.

          BaseDirectory -> (string)
              The landing directory (folder) for files that are transferred by
              using the AS2 protocol.

          AccessRole -> (string)
              With AS2, you can send files by  calling  StartFileTransfer  and
              specifying  the  file  paths  in  the  request  parameter, Send-
              FilePaths . We use the files parent directory (for example,  for
              --send-file-paths  /bucket/dir/file.txt  ,  parent  directory is
              /bucket/dir/ ) to temporarily  store  a  processed  AS2  message
              file,  store  the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and
              write a final JSON file  containing  relevant  metadata  of  the
              transmission. So, the AccessRole needs to provide read and write
              access to the parent directory of the file location used in  the
              StartFileTransfer  request.  Additionally,  you  need to provide
              read and write access to the parent directory of the files  that
              you intend to send with StartFileTransfer .

              If  you  are  using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector,
              the access role requires the secretsmanager:GetSecretValue  per-
              mission  for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a cus-
              tomer-managed key instead of the Amazon Web Services managed key
              in  Secrets  Manager,  then  the role also needs the kms:Decrypt
              permission for that key.

          Tags -> (list)
              Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for  agree-
              ments.

              (structure)
                 Creates  a  key-value  pair for a specific resource. Tags are
                 metadata that you can use to search for and group a  resource
                 for  various  purposes. You can apply tags to servers, users,
                 and roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For  exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate a tag called Group and assign the values Research and Ac-
                 counting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains  one or more values that you assigned to the key
                     name you create.
