CREATE-SERVER()                                                CREATE-SERVER()



NAME
       create-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Instantiates  an auto-scaling virtual server based on the selected file
       transfer protocol in Amazon Web Services. When you make updates to your
       file  transfer protocol-enabled server or when you work with users, use
       the service-generated ServerId property that is assigned to  the  newly
       created server.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --certificate (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Certificate Manager (ACM) cer-
          tificate. Required when Protocols is set to FTPS .

          To request a new public certificate, see Request a  public  certifi-
          cate in the Certificate Manager User Guide .

          To  import  an existing certificate into ACM, see Importing certifi-
          cates into ACM in the Certificate Manager User Guide .

          To request a private certificate to use FTPS through private IP  ad-
          dresses,  see  Request a private certificate in the Certificate Man-
          ager User Guide .

          Certificates with the following  cryptographic  algorithms  and  key
          sizes are supported:

          o 2048-bit RSA (RSA_2048)

          o 4096-bit RSA (RSA_4096)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 256 bit (EC_prime256v1)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 384 bit (EC_secp384r1)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 521 bit (EC_secp521r1)

          NOTE:
              The certificate must be a valid SSL/TLS X.509 version 3 certifi-
              cate with FQDN or IP address specified and information about the
              issuer.

       --domain (string)
          The  domain  of  the storage system that is used for file transfers.
          There are two domains available: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Ama-
          zon  S3)  and  Amazon  Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). The default
          value is S3.

          NOTE:
              After the server is created, the domain cannot be changed.

          Possible values:

          o S3

          o EFS

       --endpoint-details (structure)
          The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that  are  config-
          ured  for  your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC,
          you can make your endpoint accessible only to resources within  your
          VPC,  or  you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make your endpoint
          accessible to clients over the internet. Your VPC's default security
          groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.

          AddressAllocationIds -> (list)
              A  list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach an
              Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 and it is only valid in the UpdateServer API.

              (string)

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              A  list of subnet IDs that are required to host your server end-
              point in your VPC.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

              (string)

          VpcEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This  property  can  only  be set when EndpointType is set to
                 VPC_ENDPOINT .

                 For             more             information,             see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The VPC ID of the VPC in  which  a  server's  endpoint  will  be
              hosted.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              A list of security groups IDs that are available  to  attach  to
              your server's endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

                 You  can  edit   the   SecurityGroupIds   property   in   the
                 UpdateServer  API  only  if you are changing the EndpointType
                 from PUBLIC or VPC_ENDPOINT  to  VPC  .  To  change  security
                 groups  associated with your server's VPC endpoint after cre-
                 ation, use the Amazon EC2 ModifyVpcEndpoint API.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AddressAllocationIds=string,string,SubnetIds=string,string,VpcEndpointId=string,VpcId=string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AddressAllocationIds": ["string", ...],
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "VpcEndpointId": "string",
            "VpcId": "string",
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --endpoint-type (string)
          The type of endpoint that you want  your  server  to  use.  You  can
          choose  to  make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC)
          or host it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that  is  hosted  in  a
          VPC,  you  can  restrict  access  to  your server and resources only
          within your VPC or choose to make it internet  facing  by  attaching
          Elastic IP addresses directly to it.

          NOTE:
              After  May  19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using
              EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Services account if
              your  account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you
              have already created servers with  EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT  in
              your  Amazon Web Services account on or before May 19, 2021, you
              will not be affected. After this date, use EndpointType =``VPC``
              .

              For              more              information,              see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

              It  is  recommended  that you use VPC as the EndpointType . With
              this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up
              to  three  Elastic  IPv4  addresses  (BYO IP included) with your
              server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict  traf-
              fic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with
              EndpointType set to VPC_ENDPOINT .

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC

          o VPC

          o VPC_ENDPOINT

       --host-key (string)
          The RSA, ECDSA, or ED25519 private key to use for your server.

          Use the following command to generate an RSA 2048 bit  key  with  no
          passphrase:
              ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key .

          Use  a  minimum  value  of  2048 for the -b option. You can create a
          stronger key by using 3072 or 4096.

          Use the following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key  with  no
          passphrase:
              ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key .

          Valid values for the -b option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521.

          Use  the  following  command  to  generate  an  ED25519  key with no
          passphrase:
              ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key .

          For all of these commands, you can replace my-new-server-key with  a
          string of your choice.

          WARNING:
              If  you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an exist-
              ing SFTP-enabled server to a new server, don't update  the  host
              key.  Accidentally  changing  a server's host key can be disrup-
              tive.

          For more information, see Change the host key for your  SFTP-enabled
          server in the Transfer Family User Guide .

       --identity-provider-details (structure)
          Required  when  IdentityProviderType is set to AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE
          or API_GATEWAY . Accepts an array containing all of the  information
          required  to  use  a  directory in AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or invoke a
          customer-supplied authentication API, including the API Gateway URL.
          Not required when IdentityProviderType is set to SERVICE_MANAGED .

          Url -> (string)
              Provides  the location of the service endpoint used to authenti-
              cate users.

          InvocationRole -> (string)
              Provides the type of InvocationRole  used  to  authenticate  the
              user account.

          DirectoryId -> (string)
              The  identifier of the Directory Service directory that you want
              to stop sharing.

          Function -> (string)
              The ARN for a lambda function to use for the Identity provider.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Url=string,InvocationRole=string,DirectoryId=string,Function=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Url": "string",
            "InvocationRole": "string",
            "DirectoryId": "string",
            "Function": "string"
          }

       --identity-provider-type (string)
          The mode of authentication for a server. The default value  is  SER-
          VICE_MANAGED , which allows you to store and access user credentials
          within the Transfer Family service.

          Use AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to  provide  access  to  Active  Directory
          groups in Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Micro-
          soft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or  in  Amazon
          Web  Services  using  AD Connector. This option also requires you to
          provide a Directory ID by using the IdentityProviderDetails  parame-
          ter.

          Use  the API_GATEWAY value to integrate with an identity provider of
          your choosing. The API_GATEWAY setting requires you  to  provide  an
          Amazon  API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication by using
          the IdentityProviderDetails parameter.

          Use the AWS_LAMBDA value to directly use an Lambda function as  your
          identity  provider.  If  you choose this value, you must specify the
          ARN for the Lambda function in the Function parameter or the Identi-
          tyProviderDetails data type.

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_MANAGED

          o API_GATEWAY

          o AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE

          o AWS_LAMBDA

       --logging-role (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging
          for  Amazon  S3 or Amazon EFSevents. When set, you can view user ac-
          tivity in your CloudWatch logs.

       --post-authentication-login-banner (string)
          Specifies a string to display when users connect to a  server.  This
          string is displayed after the user authenticates.

          NOTE:
              The  SFTP  protocol does not support post-authentication display
              banners.

       --pre-authentication-login-banner (string)
          Specifies a string to display when users connect to a  server.  This
          string  is displayed before the user authenticates. For example, the
          following banner displays details about using the system:
              This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals
              using  this  computer  system without authority, or in excess of
              their authority, are subject to having all of  their  activities
              on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel.

       --protocols (list)
          Specifies  the  file  transfer protocol or protocols over which your
          file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint.
          The available protocols are:

          o SFTP  (Secure  Shell  (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer
            over SSH

          o FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with  TLS  en-
            cryption

          o FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer

          o AS2  (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting structured
            business-to-business data

          NOTE:

              o If you select FTPS , you must choose a certificate  stored  in
                Certificate  Manager  (ACM)  which  is  used  to identify your
                server when clients connect to it over FTPS.

              o If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS , then  the  Endpoint-
                Type  must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must be AWS_DI-
                RECTORY_SERVICE or API_GATEWAY .

              o If Protocol includes FTP , then AddressAllocationIds cannot be
                associated.

              o If  Protocol is set only to SFTP , the EndpointType can be set
                to PUBLIC and the IdentityProviderType  can  be  set  to  SER-
                VICE_MANAGED .

              o If Protocol includes AS2 , then the EndpointType must be VPC ,
                and domain must be Amazon S3.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SFTP
            FTP
            FTPS
            AS2

       --protocol-details (structure)
          The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

          o To indicate passive mode (for FTP and  FTPS  protocols),  use  the
            PassiveIp parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such
            as the external IP address of a firewall,  router,  or  load  bal-
            ancer.

          o To  ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to
            use the SETSTAT command on a file that you  are  uploading  to  an
            Amazon  S3  bucket,  use  the SetStatOption parameter. To have the
            Transfer Family server ignore the SETSTAT command and upload files
            without  needing  to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the
            value to ENABLE_NO_OP . If you set the SetStatOption parameter  to
            ENABLE_NO_OP  ,  Transfer  Family  generates a log entry to Amazon
            CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is mak-
            ing a SETSTAT call.

          o To  determine  whether your Transfer Family server resumes recent,
            negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use  the  TlsSes-
            sionResumptionMode parameter.

          o As2Transports indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages.
            Currently, only HTTP is supported.

          PassiveIp -> (string)
              Indicates passive mode, for FTP and FTPS protocols. Enter a sin-
              gle  IPv4  address, such as the public IP address of a firewall,
              router, or load balancer. For example:

                 ``
                 aws   transfer    update-server    --protocol-details    Pas-
                 siveIp=*0.0.0.0* ``

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 611)
                        Inline literal start-string without end-string.

              Replace  ``  0.0.0.0  `` in the example above with the actual IP
              address you want to use.

              NOTE:
                 If you change the PassiveIp value, you  must  stop  and  then
                 restart  your  Transfer  Family server for the change to take
                 effect. For details on using passive mode (PASV) in a NAT en-
                 vironment, see Configuring your FTPS server behind a firewall
                 or NAT with Transfer Family .

          TlsSessionResumptionMode -> (string)
              A property used with Transfer Family servers that use  the  FTPS
              protocol.  TLS Session Resumption provides a mechanism to resume
              or share a negotiated secret key between the  control  and  data
              connection  for an FTPS session. TlsSessionResumptionMode deter-
              mines whether or not the server resumes recent, negotiated  ses-
              sions  through  a  unique session ID. This property is available
              during CreateServer and UpdateServer calls. If  a  TlsSessionRe-
              sumptionMode  value is not specified during CreateServer , it is
              set to ENFORCED by default.

              o DISABLED : the server does not process TLS session  resumption
                client  requests  and  creates  a new TLS session for each re-
                quest.

              o ENABLED : the server processes and accepts  clients  that  are
                performing  TLS  session resumption. The server doesn't reject
                client data connections that do not perform  the  TLS  session
                resumption client processing.

              o ENFORCED  :  the server processes and accepts clients that are
                performing TLS session resumption. The server  rejects  client
                data  connections  that do not perform the TLS session resump-
                tion client processing. Before you set the value to ENFORCED ,
                test your clients.

              NOTE:
                 Not  all  FTPS clients perform TLS session resumption. So, if
                 you choose to enforce TLS session resumption, you prevent any
                 connections from FTPS clients that don't perform the protocol
                 negotiation. To determine whether or not you can use the  EN-
                 FORCED value, you need to test your clients.

          SetStatOption -> (string)
              Use the SetStatOption to ignore the error that is generated when
              the client attempts to use SETSTAT on a file you  are  uploading
              to an S3 bucket.

              Some  SFTP  file  transfer clients can attempt to change the at-
              tributes of remote files, including timestamp  and  permissions,
              using  commands,  such  as SETSTAT when uploading the file. How-
              ever, these commands are not compatible with object storage sys-
              tems,  such  as Amazon S3. Due to this incompatibility, file up-
              loads from these clients can result in errors even when the file
              is otherwise successfully uploaded.

              Set the value to ENABLE_NO_OP to have the Transfer Family server
              ignore the SETSTAT command, and upload files without needing  to
              make  any  changes  to your SFTP client. While the SetStatOption
              ENABLE_NO_OP setting ignores the error, it does generate  a  log
              entry  in  Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so you can determine when the
              client is making a SETSTAT call.

              NOTE:
                 If you want to preserve the original timestamp for your file,
                 and  modify other file attributes using SETSTAT , you can use
                 Amazon EFS as backend storage with Transfer Family.

          As2Transports -> (list)
              Indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages.  Currently,
              only HTTP is supported.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PassiveIp=string,TlsSessionResumptionMode=string,SetStatOption=string,As2Transports=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PassiveIp": "string",
            "TlsSessionResumptionMode": "DISABLED"|"ENABLED"|"ENFORCED",
            "SetStatOption": "DEFAULT"|"ENABLE_NO_OP",
            "As2Transports": ["HTTP", ...]
          }

       --security-policy-name (string)
          Specifies  the  name  of the security policy that is attached to the
          server.

       --tags (list)
          Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for servers.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data  that  you  can  use to search for and group a resource for
              various purposes. You can apply  tags  to  servers,  users,  and
              roles.  A  tag key can take more than one value. For example, to
              group servers for accounting purposes, you might  create  a  tag
              called  Group  and  assign the values Research and Accounting to
              that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 you create.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --workflow-details (structure)
          Specifies  the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execu-
          tion role that's used for executing the workflow.

          OnUpload -> (list)
              A trigger that starts a workflow: the workflow begins to execute
              after a file is uploaded.

              To  remove an associated workflow from a server, you can provide
              an empty OnUpload object, as in the following example.
                 aws transfer  update-server  --server-id  s-01234567890abcdef
                 --workflow-details '{"OnUpload":[]}'

              (structure)
                 Specifies  the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the
                 execution role that's used for executing the workflow.

                 WorkflowId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the workflow.

                 ExecutionRole -> (string)
                     Includes the  necessary  permissions  for  S3,  EFS,  and
                     Lambda  operations  that Transfer can assume, so that all
                     workflow steps can operate on the required resources

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OnUpload=[{WorkflowId=string,ExecutionRole=string},{WorkflowId=string,ExecutionRole=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "OnUpload": [
              {
                "WorkflowId": "string",
                "ExecutionRole": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ServerId -> (string)
          The service-assigned ID of the server that is created.
