OPTIONS
       --workflow-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the workflow.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                        Specifies  which  file to use as input to the workflow
                        step: either the output from the previous step, or the
                        originally uploaded file for the workflow.

                        o Enter  ${previous.file}  to use the previous file as
                          the input. In this case, this workflow step uses the
                          output  file  from the previous workflow step as in-
                          put. This is the default value.

                        o Enter ${original.file}  to  use  the  originally-up-
                          loaded file location as input for this step.

                 TagStepDetails -> (structure)
                     Details for a step that creates one or more tags.

                     You  specify  one  or  more  tags:  each  tag  contains a
                     key/value pair.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the step, used as an identifier.

                     Tags -> (list)
                        Array that contains from 1 to 10 key/value pairs.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies the key-value pair that are assigned  to
                            a file during the execution of a Tagging step.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                            Value -> (string)
                               The value that corresponds to the key.

                     SourceFileLocation -> (string)
                        Specifies  which  file to use as input to the workflow
                        step: either the output from the previous step, or the
                        originally uploaded file for the workflow.

                        o Enter  ${previous.file}  to use the previous file as
                          the input. In this case, this workflow step uses the
                          output  file  from the previous workflow step as in-
                          put. This is the default value.

                        o Enter ${original.file}  to  use  the  originally-up-
                          loaded file location as input for this step.

          WorkflowId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the workflow.

          Tags -> (list)
              Key-value  pairs  that can be used to group and search for work-
              flows. Tags are metadata attached to workflows for any purpose.

              (structure)
                 Creates a key-value pair for a specific  resource.  Tags  are
                 metadata  that you can use to search for and group a resource
                 for various purposes. You can apply tags to  servers,  users,
                 and  roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate a tag called Group and assign the values Research and Ac-
                 counting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains one or more values that you assigned to the  key
