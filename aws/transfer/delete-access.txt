       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-access
          --server-id <value>
          --external-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this  user
          assigned.

       --external-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  that  is required to identify specific groups
          within your directory. The users of the  group  that  you  associate
          have  access  to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the en-
          abled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the  group  name,
          you  can  view the SID values by running the following command using
          Windows PowerShell.
              Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like  "*YourGroupName*  *"}
              -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid

          In  that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your Active
          Directory group.

          The regular expression used to validate this parameter is  a  string
          of  characters  consisting  of  uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric
          characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores  or  any
          of the following characters: =,.@:/-

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
