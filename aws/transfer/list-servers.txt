LIST-SERVERS()                                                  LIST-SERVERS()



NAME
       list-servers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  file  transfer protocol-enabled servers that are associated
       with your Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-servers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Servers

SYNOPSIS
            list-servers
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When  you can get additional results from the ListServers operation,
          a NextToken parameter is returned in the output. In a following com-
          mand,  you  can  pass in the NextToken parameter to continue listing
          additional servers.

       Servers -> (list)
          An array of servers that were listed.

          (structure)
              Returns properties of a file  transfer  protocol-enabled  server
              that was specified.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Specifies  the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a server
                 to be listed.

              Domain -> (string)
                 Specifies the domain of the storage system that is  used  for
                 file transfers.

              IdentityProviderType -> (string)
                 The mode of authentication for a server. The default value is
                 SERVICE_MANAGED , which allows you to store and  access  user
                 credentials within the Transfer Family service.

                 Use  AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active Direc-
                 tory groups in Directory Service for Microsoft Active  Direc-
                 tory  or Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises envi-
                 ronment or in Amazon Web Services using  AD  Connector.  This
                 option  also  requires you to provide a Directory ID by using
                 the IdentityProviderDetails parameter.

                 Use the API_GATEWAY  value  to  integrate  with  an  identity
                 provider  of  your choosing. The API_GATEWAY setting requires
                 you to provide an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for
                 authentication  by  using the IdentityProviderDetails parame-
                 ter.

                 Use the AWS_LAMBDA value to directly use an  Lambda  function
                 as your identity provider. If you choose this value, you must
                 specify the ARN for the Lambda function in the  Function  pa-
                 rameter or the IdentityProviderDetails data type.

              EndpointType -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  type of VPC endpoint that your server is con-
                 nected to. If your server is connected  to  a  VPC  endpoint,
                 your server isn't accessible over the public internet.

              LoggingRole -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the Identity and Access
                 Management (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on  Amazon
                 CloudWatch  logging  for  Amazon S3 or Amazon EFSevents. When
                 set, you can view user activity in your CloudWatch logs.

              ServerId -> (string)
                 Specifies the  unique  system  assigned  identifier  for  the
                 servers that were listed.

              State -> (string)
                 The  condition  of  the server that was described. A value of
                 ONLINE indicates that the server can accept jobs and transfer
                 files.  A State value of OFFLINE means that the server cannot
                 perform file transfer operations.

                 The states of STARTING and STOPPING indicate that the  server
                 is  in  an  intermediate  state, either not fully able to re-
                 spond, or not fully offline. The values  of  START_FAILED  or
                 STOP_FAILED can indicate an error condition.

              UserCount -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  number of users that are assigned to a server
                 you specified with the ServerId .
