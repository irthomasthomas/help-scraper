CREATE-WORKFLOW()                                            CREATE-WORKFLOW()



NAME
       create-workflow -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows  you  to create a workflow with specified steps and step details
       the workflow invokes after file transfer completes.  After  creating  a
       workflow,  you  can  associate  the  workflow created with any transfer
       servers by specifying the workflow-details field  in  CreateServer  and
       UpdateServer operations.

       --on-exception-steps (list)
          Specifies the steps (actions) to take if errors are encountered dur-
          ing execution of the workflow.

          NOTE:
              For  custom  steps, the lambda function needs to send FAILURE to
              the call back API to kick off the exception steps. Additionally,
              if the lambda does not send SUCCESS before it times out, the ex-
              ception steps are executed.

       --tags (list)
          Key-value  pairs that can be used to group and search for workflows.
          Tags are metadata attached to workflows for any purpose.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data  that  you  can  use to search for and group a resource for
              various purposes. You can apply  tags  to  servers,  users,  and
              roles.  A  tag key can take more than one value. For example, to
              group servers for accounting purposes, you might  create  a  tag
              called  Group  and  assign the values Research and Accounting to
              that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 you create.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
