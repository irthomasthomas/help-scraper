NAME
       update-connector -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  some  of the parameters for an existing connector. Provide the
       ConnectorId for the connector that you want to update, along  with  the
       new values for the parameters to update.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-connector
          --connector-id <value>
          [--url <value>]
          [--as2-config <value>]
          [--access-role <value>]
          [--logging-role <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connector-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the connector.

       --url (string)
          The URL of the partner's AS2 endpoint.

       --as2-config (structure)
          A structure that contains the parameters for a connector object.

          LocalProfileId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the AS2 process.

          PartnerProfileId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the partner for the connector.

          MessageSubject -> (string)
              A short description to help identify the connector.

          Compression -> (string)
              Specifies whether the AS2 file is compressed.

          EncryptionAlgorithm -> (string)
              The algorithm that is used to encrypt the file.

          SigningAlgorithm -> (string)
              The  algorithm  that  is used to sign the AS2 transfers for this
              partner profile.

          MdnSigningAlgorithm -> (string)
              The signing algorithm for the MDN response.

          MdnResponse -> (string)
              Used for outbound requests (from an Transfer Family server to  a
              partner  AS2  server)  to determine whether the partner response
              for transfers is synchronous or asynchronous. Specify either  of
              the following values:

              o SYNC : The system expects a synchronous MDN response, confirm-
                ing that the file was transferred successfully (or not).

              o NONE : Specifies that no MDN response is required.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LocalProfileId=string,PartnerProfileId=string,MessageSubject=string,Compression=string,EncryptionAlgorithm=string,SigningAlgorithm=string,MdnSigningAlgorithm=string,MdnResponse=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LocalProfileId": "string",
            "PartnerProfileId": "string",
            "MessageSubject": "string",
            "Compression": "ZLIB"|"DISABLED",
            "EncryptionAlgorithm": "AES128_CBC"|"AES192_CBC"|"AES256_CBC",
            "SigningAlgorithm": "SHA256"|"SHA384"|"SHA512"|"SHA1"|"NONE",
            "MdnSigningAlgorithm": "SHA256"|"SHA384"|"SHA512"|"SHA1"|"NONE"|"DEFAULT",
            "MdnResponse": "SYNC"|"NONE"
          }

       --access-role (string)
          With AS2, you can send files by calling StartFileTransfer and speci-
          fying  the  file  paths in the request parameter, SendFilePaths . We
          use the files parent directory (for example,  for  --send-file-paths
          /bucket/dir/file.txt  , parent directory is /bucket/dir/ ) to tempo-
          rarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we re-
          ceive  them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing
          relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the AccessRole  needs  to
          provide  read  and  write access to the parent directory of the file
          location used in the StartFileTransfer  request.  Additionally,  you
          need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the
          files that you intend to send with StartFileTransfer .

       --logging-role (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that allows a connector to turn on CloudWatch logging for
          Amazon S3 events. When set, you can view connector activity in  your
          CloudWatch logs.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConnectorId -> (string)
          Returns the identifier of the connector object that you  are  updat-
          ing.
