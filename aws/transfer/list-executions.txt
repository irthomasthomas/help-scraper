LIST-EXECUTIONS()                                            LIST-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all executions for the specified workflow.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-executions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Executions

SYNOPSIS
            list-executions
          --workflow-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workflow-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the workflow.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          ListExecutions returns the NextToken parameter in  the  output.  You
          can  then  pass  the  NextToken parameter in a subsequent command to
          continue listing additional executions.

       WorkflowId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the workflow.

       Executions -> (list)
          Returns the details for each execution.

          o NextToken : returned from a call to several APIs, you can use pass
            it  to  a subsequent command to continue listing additional execu-
            tions.

          o StartTime : timestamp indicating when the execution began.

          o Executions : details of the execution, including the execution ID,
            initial file location, and Service metadata.

          o Status  :  one  of the following values: IN_PROGRESS , COMPLETED ,
            EXCEPTION , HANDLING_EXEPTION .

          (structure)
              Returns properties of the execution that is specified.

              ExecutionId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the execution of a workflow.

              InitialFileLocation -> (structure)
                 A structure that describes the Amazon S3 or  EFS  file  loca-
                 tion. This is the file location when the execution begins: if
                 the file is being copied, this is the initial (as opposed  to
                 destination) file location.

                 S3FileLocation -> (structure)
                     Specifies the S3 details for the file being used, such as
                     bucket, Etag, and so forth.

                     Bucket -> (string)
                        Specifies the S3 bucket that contains the  file  being
                        used.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  name  assigned to the file when it was created in
                        S3. You use the object key to retrieve the object.

                     VersionId -> (string)
                        Specifies the file version.

                     Etag -> (string)
                        The entity tag is a hash of the object. The  ETag  re-
                        flects  changes only to the contents of an object, not
                        its metadata.

                 EfsFileLocation -> (structure)
                     Specifies the Amazon EFS ID and the path for the file be-
                     ing used.

                     FileSystemId -> (string)
                        The ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The pathname for the folder being used by a workflow.

              ServiceMetadata -> (structure)
                 A  container object for the session details associated with a
                 workflow.

                 UserDetails -> (structure)
                     The Server ID (ServerId ), Session ID  (SessionId  )  and
                     user (UserName ) make up the UserDetails .

                     UserName -> (string)
                        A unique string that identifies a user account associ-
                        ated with a server.

                     ServerId -> (string)
                        The system-assigned unique identifier for  a  Transfer
                        server instance.

                     SessionId -> (string)
                        The  system-assigned  unique  identifier for a session
                        that corresponds to the workflow.

              Status -> (string)
