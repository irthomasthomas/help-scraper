OPTIONS
       --agreement-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the agreement. This identifier is returned
          when you create an agreement.

       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance.  This  is
          the specific server that the agreement uses.

       --description (string)
          To replace the existing description, provide a short description for
          the agreement.

       --status (string)
          You can update the status for the agreement,  either  activating  an
          inactive agreement or the reverse.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

       --local-profile-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the AS2 local profile.

          To change the local profile identifier, provide a new value here.

       --partner-profile-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the partner profile. To change the partner
          profile identifier, provide a new value here.

       --base-directory (string)
          To change the landing directory (folder) for files that  are  trans-
          ferred, provide the bucket folder that you want to use; for example,
          ``
          /amzn-s3-demo-bucket /home /mydirectory `` .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 125)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --access-role (string)
          Connectors  are used to send files using either the AS2 or SFTP pro-
          tocol. For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)
          of the Identity and Access Management role to use.
              For AS2 connectors

          With AS2, you can send files by calling StartFileTransfer and speci-
          fying the file paths in the request parameter,  SendFilePaths  .  We
          use  the  files parent directory (for example, for --send-file-paths
          /bucket/dir/file.txt , parent directory is /bucket/dir/ ) to  tempo-
          rarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we re-
          ceive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file  containing
          relevant  metadata  of the transmission. So, the AccessRole needs to
          provide read and write access to the parent directory  of  the  file
          location  used  in  the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally, you
          need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the
          files that you intend to send with StartFileTransfer .

          If  you  are  using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the
          access role requires  the  secretsmanager:GetSecretValue  permission
          for  the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed
          key instead of the Amazon Web Services managed key in  Secrets  Man-
          ager,  then  the role also needs the kms:Decrypt permission for that
          key.
              For SFTP connectors

          Make sure that the access role provides read and write access to the
          parent  directory of the file location that's used in the StartFile-
          Transfer request. Additionally, make sure that the role provides se-
          cretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission to Secrets Manager.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AgreementId -> (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the agreement. This identifier is returned
          when you create an agreement.
