NAME
       describe-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       You  can use DescribeExecution to check the details of the execution of
       the specified workflow.

       NOTE:
          This API call only returns details for in-progress workflows.

          If you provide an ID for an execution that is not in progress, or if
          the execution doesn't match the specified workflow ID, you receive a
          ResourceNotFound exception.

OPTIONS
       --execution-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the execution of a workflow.

       --workflow-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the workflow.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

                     associated with a server.

                 ServerId -> (string)
                     The system-assigned  unique  identifier  for  a  Transfer
                     server instance.

                 Management  (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon
                 CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or  Amazon  EFSevents.  When
