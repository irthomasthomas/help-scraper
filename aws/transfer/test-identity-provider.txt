TEST-IDENTITY-PROVIDER()                              TEST-IDENTITY-PROVIDER()



NAME
       test-identity-provider -

DESCRIPTION
       If  the IdentityProviderType of a file transfer protocol-enabled server
       is AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or API_Gateway , tests whether  your  identity
       provider is set up successfully. We highly recommend that you call this
       operation to test your authentication method as soon as you create your
       server.  By  doing  so,  you  can troubleshoot issues with the identity
       provider integration to ensure that your users can successfully use the
       service.

       The ServerId and UserName parameters are required. The ServerProtocol ,
       SourceIp , and UserPassword are all optional.

       Note the following:

       o You cannot use TestIdentityProvider if  the  IdentityProviderType  of
         your server is SERVICE_MANAGED .

       o TestIdentityProvider  does  not work with keys: it only accepts pass-
         words.

       o TestIdentityProvider can test the password  operation  for  a  custom
         Identity Provider that handles keys and passwords.

       o If  you provide any incorrect values for any parameters, the Response
         field is empty.

       o If you provide a server ID for a  server  that  uses  service-managed
         users,  you  get  an error:   An error occurred (InvalidRequestExcep-
         tion) when calling the TestIdentityProvider operation:  s-*server-ID*
         not configured for external auth

       o If  you enter a Server ID for the --server-id parameter that does not
         identify an actual Transfer server, you receive the following  error:
         An error occurred (ResourceNotFoundException) when calling the TestI-
         dentityProvider operation: Unknown server  .   It  is  possible  your
         sever  is  in  a different region. You can specify a region by adding
         the following: --region region-code , such as --region  us-east-2  to
         specify a server in US East (Ohio) .

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A  system-assigned  identifier  for a specific server. That server's
          user authentication method is tested with a user name and password.

       --server-protocol (string)
          The type of file transfer protocol to be tested.

          The available protocols are:

          o Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)

          o File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS)

          o File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

          o Applicability Statement 2 (AS2)

          Possible values:

          o SFTP

          o FTP

          o FTPS

          o AS2

       --source-ip (string)
          The source IP address of the account to be tested.

       --user-name (string)
          The name of the account to be tested.

       --user-password (string)
          The password of the account to be tested.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Response -> (string)
          The response that is returned from your API Gateway or  your  Lambda
          function.

       StatusCode -> (integer)
          The  HTTP  status code that is the response from your API Gateway or
          your Lambda function.

       Message -> (string)
          A message that indicates whether the test was successful or not.

          NOTE:
              If an empty string is returned, the most likely  cause  is  that
              the  authentication failed due to an incorrect username or pass-
              word.

       Url -> (string)
          The endpoint of the service used to authenticate a user.
