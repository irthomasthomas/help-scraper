LIST-USERS()                                                      LIST-USERS()



NAME
       list-users -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  users  for a file transfer protocol-enabled server that you
       specify by passing the ServerId parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-users is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Users

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A  system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has users as-
          signed to it.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When you can get additional results from the ListUsers call, a Next-
          Token  parameter  is  returned in the output. You can then pass in a
          subsequent command to the NextToken parameter  to  continue  listing
          additional users.

       ServerId -> (string)
          A  system-assigned unique identifier for a server that the users are
          assigned to.

       Users -> (list)
          Returns the user accounts and  their  properties  for  the  ServerId
          value that you specify.

          (structure)
              Returns properties of the user that you specify.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Provides  the  unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user
                 that you want to learn about.

              HomeDirectory -> (string)
                 The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to
                 the server using the client.

                 A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

              HomeDirectoryType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  landing  directory (folder) that you want your
                 users' home directory to be when they log in to  the  server.
                 If you set it to PATH , the user will see the absolute Amazon
                 S3 bucket or EFS paths as is in their file transfer  protocol
                 clients. If you set it LOGICAL , you need to provide mappings
                 in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make  Amazon
                 S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.

              Role -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the Identity and Access
                 Management (IAM) role that controls  your  users'  access  to
                 your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies
                 attached to this role determine the level of access that  you
                 want  to  provide your users when transferring files into and
                 out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file  system.  The
                 IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows
                 the server to  access  your  resources  when  servicing  your
                 users' transfer requests.

                 NOTE:
                     The  IAM  role  that  controls your users' access to your
                     Amazon S3 bucket for servers with Domain=S3 , or your EFS
                     file system for servers with Domain=EFS .

                     The policies attached to this role determine the level of
                     access you want to provide your users  when  transferring
                     files  into  and  out of your S3 buckets or EFS file sys-
                     tems.

              SshPublicKeyCount -> (integer)
                 Specifies the number of SSH public keys stored for  the  user
                 you specified.

              UserName -> (string)
                 Specifies  the name of the user whose ARN was specified. User
                 names are used for authentication purposes.
