OPTIONS
       --connector-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the connector.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Connector -> (structure)
          The structure that contains the details of the connector.

          Arn -> (string)
              The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the connector.

          ConnectorId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the connector.

          Url -> (string)
              The URL of the partner's AS2 endpoint.

          As2Config -> (structure)
              A structure that contains the parameters for a connector object.

              LocalProfileId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the AS2 local profile.

              PartnerProfileId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the partner profile for  the  connec-
                 tor.

              MessageSubject -> (string)
                 Used  as  the  Subject  HTTP header attribute in AS2 messages
                 that are being sent with the connector.

              Compression -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the AS2 file is compressed.

              EncryptionAlgorithm -> (string)
                 The algorithm that is used to encrypt the file.

              SigningAlgorithm -> (string)
                 The algorithm that is used to sign the AS2 messages sent with
                 the connector.

              MdnSigningAlgorithm -> (string)
                 The signing algorithm for the MDN response.

                 NOTE:
                     If  set  to  DEFAULT  (or  not set at all), the value for
                     SigningAlogorithm is used.

              MdnResponse -> (string)
                 Used for outbound requests (from an Transfer Family server to
                 a  partner  AS2  server) to determine whether the partner re-
                 sponse for transfers is synchronous or asynchronous.  Specify
                 either of the following values:

                 o SYNC  : The system expects a synchronous MDN response, con-
                   firming that the  file  was  transferred  successfully  (or
                   not).

                 o NONE : Specifies that no MDN response is required.

          AccessRole -> (string)
              With  AS2,  you  can send files by calling StartFileTransfer and
              specifying the  file  paths  in  the  request  parameter,  Send-
              FilePaths  . We use the files parent directory (for example, for
              --send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt  ,  parent  directory  is
              /bucket/dir/  )  to  temporarily  store  a processed AS2 message
              file, store the MDN when we receive them from the  partner,  and
              write  a  final  JSON  file  containing relevant metadata of the
              transmission. So, the AccessRole needs to provide read and write
              access  to the parent directory of the file location used in the
              StartFileTransfer request. Additionally,  you  need  to  provide
              read  and write access to the parent directory of the files that
              you intend to send with StartFileTransfer .

          LoggingRole -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and  Access  Man-
              agement (IAM) role that allows a connector to turn on CloudWatch
              logging for Amazon S3 events. When set, you can  view  connector
              activity in your CloudWatch logs.

          Tags -> (list)
              Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for connec-
              tors.

              (structure)
                 Creates a key-value pair for a specific  resource.  Tags  are
                 metadata  that you can use to search for and group a resource
                 for various purposes. You can apply tags to  servers,  users,
                 and  roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate a tag called Group and assign the values Research and Ac-
                 counting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains one or more values that you assigned to the  key
                     name you create.
