NAME
       describe-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  file transfer protocol-enabled server that you specify by
       passing the ServerId parameter.

       The response contains a description of a server's properties. When  you
       set  EndpointType to VPC, the response will contain the EndpointDetails
       .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-server
          --server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Server -> (structure)
          An array containing the properties of a server with the ServerID you
          specified.

          Arn -> (string)
              Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the server.

          Certificate -> (string)
              Specifies the ARN of the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate  Manager
              (ACM) certificate. Required when Protocols is set to FTPS .

          ProtocolDetails -> (structure)
              The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

              Use  the  PassiveIp  parameter to indicate passive mode. Enter a
              single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address
              of a firewall, router, or load balancer.

              PassiveIp -> (string)
                 Indicates  passive  mode, for FTP and FTPS protocols. Enter a
                 single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP  ad-
                 dress of a firewall, router, or load balancer. For example:

                     ``
                     aws   transfer   update-server   --protocol-details  Pas-
                     siveIp=*0.0.0.0* ``

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 118)
                            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 Replace `` 0.0.0.0 `` in the example above with the actual IP
                 address you want to use.

                 NOTE:
                     If you change the PassiveIp value, you must stop and then
                     restart your Transfer server for the change to  take  ef-
                     fect. For details on using Passive IP (PASV) in a NAT en-
                     vironment, see Configuring  your  FTPS  server  behind  a
                     firewall  or NAT with Amazon Web Services Transfer Family
                     .

              TlsSessionResumptionMode -> (string)
                 A property used with Transfer servers that use the FTPS  pro-
                 tocol.  TLS Session Resumption provides a mechanism to resume
                 or share a negotiated secret key between the control and data
                 connection  for an FTPS session. TlsSessionResumptionMode de-
                 termines whether or not the server resumes recent, negotiated
                 sessions through a unique session ID. This property is avail-
                 able during CreateServer and UpdateServer calls. If a TlsSes-
                 sionResumptionMode  value  is  not  specified  during Create-
                 Server, it is set to ENFORCED by default.

                 o DISABLED : the server does not process TLS session  resump-
                   tion client requests and creates a new TLS session for each
                   request.

                 o ENABLED : the server processes and accepts clients that are
                   performing  TLS  session resumption. The server doesn't re-
                   ject client data connections that do not  perform  the  TLS
                   session resumption client processing.

                 o ENFORCED  :  the  server processes and accepts clients that
                   are performing TLS session resumption. The  server  rejects
                   client data connections that do not perform the TLS session
                   resumption client processing. Before you set the  value  to
                   ENFORCED , test your clients.

                 NOTE:
                     Not  all FTPS clients perform TLS session resumption. So,
                     if you choose to enforce TLS session resumption, you pre-
                     vent any connections from FTPS clients that don't perform
                     the protocol negotiation. To determine whether or not you
                     can  use  the  ENFORCED  value,  you  need  to  test your
                     clients.

              SetStatOption -> (string)
                 Use the SetStatOption to ignore the error that  is  generated
                 when the client attempts to use SETSTAT on a file you are up-
                 loading to an S3 bucket.

                 Some SFTP file transfer clients can attempt to change the at-
                 tributes  of  remote  files,  including timestamp and permis-
                 sions, using commands, such as  SETSTAT  when  uploading  the
                 file.  However, these commands are not compatible with object
                 storage systems, such as Amazon S3. Due to this incompatibil-
                 ity,  file  uploads  from  these clients can result in errors
                 even when the file is otherwise successfully uploaded.

                 Set the value to ENABLE_NO_OP to  have  the  Transfer  Family
                 server  ignore  the SETSTAT command, and upload files without
                 needing to make any changes to your SFTP  client.  While  the
                 SetStatOption   ENABLE_NO_OP  setting  ignores  the error, it
                 does generate a log entry in CloudWatch Logs, so you can  de-
                 termine when the client is making a SETSTAT call.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you  want to preserve the original timestamp for your
                     file, and modify other file attributes using SETSTAT, you
                     can  use Amazon EFS as backend storage with Transfer Fam-
                     ily.

          Domain -> (string)
              Specifies the domain of the storage system that is used for file
              transfers.

          EndpointDetails -> (structure)
              The  virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are con-
              figured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your
              VPC,  you  can  make it accessible only to resources within your
              VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make it accessi-
              ble  to  clients  over the internet. Your VPC's default security
              groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.

              AddressAllocationIds -> (list)
                 A list of address allocation IDs that are required to  attach
                 an Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC and it is only valid in the UpdateServer API.

                 (string)

              SubnetIds -> (list)
                 A list of subnet IDs that are required to  host  your  server
                 endpoint in your VPC.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

                 (string)

              VpcEndpointId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC_ENDPOINT .

                     For            more            information,           see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  VPC  ID  of the VPC in which a server's endpoint will be
                 hosted.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 A list of security groups IDs that are available to attach to
                 your server's endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

                     You   can  edit  the  SecurityGroupIds  property  in  the
                     UpdateServer API only if you are changing  the  Endpoint-
                     Type from PUBLIC or VPC_ENDPOINT to VPC . To change secu-
                     rity groups associated with your  server's  VPC  endpoint
                     after creation, use the Amazon EC2 ModifyVpcEndpoint API.

                 (string)

          EndpointType -> (string)
              Defines  the  type of endpoint that your server is connected to.
              If your server is connected to a VPC endpoint, your server isn't
              accessible over the public internet.

          HostKeyFingerprint -> (string)
              Specifies  the Base64-encoded SHA256 fingerprint of the server's
              host key. This value is equivalent to the output of the ssh-key-
              gen -l -f my-new-server-key command.

          IdentityProviderDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies information to call a customer-supplied authentication
              API. This field is not populated when  the  IdentityProviderType
              of a server is AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or SERVICE_MANAGED .

              Url -> (string)
                 Provides the location of the service endpoint used to authen-
                 ticate users.

              InvocationRole -> (string)
                 Provides the type of InvocationRole used to authenticate  the
                 user account.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of the Amazon Web Services Directory Service
                 directory that you want to stop sharing.

              Function -> (string)
                 The ARN for  a  lambda  function  to  use  for  the  Identity
                 provider.

          IdentityProviderType -> (string)
              Specifies  the  mode of authentication for a server. The default
              value is SERVICE_MANAGED , which allows you to store and  access
              user  credentials within the Amazon Web Services Transfer Family
              service.

              Use AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active  Directory
              groups in Amazon Web Services Managed Active Directory or Micro-
              soft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in Ama-
              zon  Web Services using AD Connectors. This option also requires
              you to provide a Directory ID using the  IdentityProviderDetails
              parameter.

              Use the API_GATEWAY value to integrate with an identity provider
              of your choosing. The API_GATEWAY setting requires you  to  pro-
              vide  an API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication us-
              ing the IdentityProviderDetails parameter.

              Use the AWS_LAMBDA value to directly use a  Lambda  function  as
              your identity provider. If you choose this value, you must spec-
              ify the ARN for the lambda function in  the  Function  parameter
              for the IdentityProviderDetails data type.

          LoggingRole -> (string)
              Specifies  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Ser-
              vices Identity and Access Management (IAM) role  that  allows  a
              server  to  turn  on  Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or
              Amazon EFS events. When set, user activity can be viewed in your
              CloudWatch logs.

          PostAuthenticationLoginBanner -> (string)
              Specify a string to display when users connect to a server. This
              string is displayed after the user authenticates.

              NOTE:
                 The SFTP protocol does not support  post-authentication  dis-
                 play banners.

          PreAuthenticationLoginBanner -> (string)
              Specify a string to display when users connect to a server. This
              string is displayed before the user authenticates. For  example,
              the following banner displays details about using the system.
                 This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individ-
                 uals using this computer system without authority, or in  ex-
                 cess  of  their authority, are subject to having all of their
                 activities on this system monitored and  recorded  by  system
                 personnel.

          Protocols -> (list)
              Specifies  the  file  transfer  protocol or protocols over which
              your file transfer protocol client can connect to your  server's
              endpoint. The available protocols are:

              o SFTP  (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File trans-
                fer over SSH

              o FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer  with  TLS
                encryption

              o FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer

              (string)

          SecurityPolicyName -> (string)
              Specifies  the  name  of the security policy that is attached to
              the server.

          ServerId -> (string)
              Specifies the unique system-assigned  identifier  for  a  server
              that you instantiate.

          State -> (string)
              Specifies  the condition of a server for the server that was de-
              scribed. A value of ONLINE indicates that the server can  accept
              jobs and transfer files. A State value of OFFLINE means that the
              server cannot perform file transfer operations.

              The states of STARTING and STOPPING indicate that the server  is
              in  an  intermediate state, either not fully able to respond, or
              not fully offline. The values of START_FAILED or STOP_FAILED can
              indicate an error condition.

          Tags -> (list)
              Specifies the key-value pairs that you can use to search for and
              group servers that were assigned to  the  server  that  was  de-
              scribed.

              (structure)
                 Creates  a  key-value  pair for a specific resource. Tags are
                 metadata that you can use to search for and group a  resource
                 for  various  purposes. You can apply tags to servers, users,
                 and roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For  exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate a tag called Group and assign the values Research and Ac-
                 counting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains  one or more values that you assigned to the key
                     name you create.

          UserCount -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of users that are assigned to a server  you
              specified with the ServerId .

          WorkflowDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the ex-
              ecution role used for executing the workflow.

              OnUpload -> (list)
                 A trigger that starts a workflow: the workflow begins to exe-
                 cute after a file is uploaded.

                 To  remove an associated workflow from a server, you can pro-
                 vide an empty OnUpload object, as in the following example.
                     aws       transfer       update-server        --server-id
                     s-01234567890abcdef --workflow-details '{"OnUpload":[]}'

                 (structure)
                     Specifies  the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and
                     the execution role used for executing the workflow.

                     WorkflowId -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the workflow.

                     ExecutionRole -> (string)
                        Includes the necessary permissions for  S3,  EFS,  and
                        Lambda  operations  that  Transfer can assume, so that
                        all workflow steps can operate  on  the  required  re-
                        sources
