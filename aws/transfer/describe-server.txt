NAME
       describe-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  file transfer protocol-enabled server that you specify by
       passing the ServerId parameter.

       The response contains a description of a server's properties. When  you
       set  EndpointType to VPC, the response will contain the EndpointDetails
       .

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Server -> (structure)
          An array containing the properties of a server with the ServerID you
          specified.

          Arn -> (string)
              Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the server.

          Certificate -> (string)
              Specifies the ARN of the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate  Manager
              (ACM) certificate. Required when Protocols is set to FTPS .

          ProtocolDetails -> (structure)
              The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

              o To indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the
                PassiveIp parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4  address,
                such as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load
                balancer.

              o To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts
                to use the SETSTAT command on a file that you are uploading to
                an Amazon S3 bucket, use the SetStatOption parameter. To  have
                the  Transfer Family server ignore the SETSTAT command and up-
                load files without needing to make any changes  to  your  SFTP
                client,  set  the  value to ENABLE_NO_OP . If you set the Set-
                StatOption parameter to ENABLE_NO_OP , Transfer Family  gener-
                ates  a  log  entry to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so that you can
                determine when the client is making a SETSTAT call.

              o To determine whether your Transfer Family server  resumes  re-
                cent, negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the
                TlsSessionResumptionMode parameter.

              o As2Transports indicates the transport method for the AS2  mes-
                sages. Currently, only HTTP is supported.

              PassiveIp -> (string)
                 Indicates  passive  mode, for FTP and FTPS protocols. Enter a
                 single IPv4 address, such as the public IP address of a fire-
                 wall, router, or load balancer. For example:
                     aws   transfer   update-server   --protocol-details  Pas-
                     siveIp=0.0.0.0

                 Replace 0.0.0.0 in the example above with the actual  IP  ad-
                 dress you want to use.

                 NOTE:
                        If  you  change the PassiveIp value, you must stop and
                        then restart  your  Transfer  Family  server  for  the
                        change  to  take  effect. For details on using passive
                        mode (PASV) in a NAT environment, see Configuring your
                        FTPS  server  behind  a  firewall or NAT with Transfer
                        Family .

                     Special values

                 The AUTO and 0.0.0.0 are special values for the PassiveIp pa-
                 rameter.  The  value PassiveIp=AUTO is assigned by default to
                 FTP and FTPS type servers. In this case, the server automati-
                 cally  responds  with one of the endpoint IPs within the PASV
                 response. PassiveIp=0.0.0.0 has a more unique application for
                 its  usage. For example, if you have a High Availability (HA)
                 Network Load Balancer (NLB) environment,  where  you  have  3
                 subnets,  you  can only specify a single IP address using the
                 PassiveIp parameter. This reduces the effectiveness of having
                 High  Availability.  In  this  case,  you  can  specify  Pas-
                 siveIp=0.0.0.0 . This tells the client to use the same IP ad-
                 dress as the Control connection and utilize all AZs for their
                 connections. Note, however, that not all FTP clients  support
                 the  PassiveIp=0.0.0.0 response. FileZilla and WinSCP do sup-
                 port it. If you are using other clients, check to see if your
                 client supports the PassiveIp=0.0.0.0 response.

              TlsSessionResumptionMode -> (string)
                 A  property  used  with  Transfer Family servers that use the
                 FTPS protocol. TLS Session Resumption provides a mechanism to
                 resume  or  share a negotiated secret key between the control
                 and data connection for an  FTPS  session.  TlsSessionResump-
                 tionMode determines whether or not the server resumes recent,
                 negotiated sessions through a unique session ID.  This  prop-
                 erty is available during CreateServer and UpdateServer calls.
                 If a TlsSessionResumptionMode value is not  specified  during
                 CreateServer , it is set to ENFORCED by default.

                 o DISABLED  : the server does not process TLS session resump-
                   tion client requests and creates a new TLS session for each
                   request.

                 o ENABLED : the server processes and accepts clients that are
                   performing TLS session resumption. The server  doesn't  re-
                   ject  client  data  connections that do not perform the TLS
                   session resumption client processing.

                 o ENFORCED : the server processes and  accepts  clients  that
                   are  performing  TLS session resumption. The server rejects
                   client data connections that do not perform the TLS session
                   resumption  client  processing. Before you set the value to
                   ENFORCED , test your clients.

                 NOTE:
                     Not all FTPS clients perform TLS session resumption.  So,
                     if you choose to enforce TLS session resumption, you pre-
                     vent any connections from FTPS clients that don't perform
                     the protocol negotiation. To determine whether or not you
                     can use  the  ENFORCED  value,  you  need  to  test  your
                     clients.

              SetStatOption -> (string)
                 Use  the  SetStatOption to ignore the error that is generated
                 when the client attempts to use SETSTAT on a file you are up-
                 loading to an S3 bucket.

                 Some SFTP file transfer clients can attempt to change the at-
                 tributes of remote files,  including  timestamp  and  permis-
                 sions,  using  commands,  such  as SETSTAT when uploading the
                 file. However, these commands are not compatible with  object
                 storage systems, such as Amazon S3. Due to this incompatibil-
                 ity, file uploads from these clients  can  result  in  errors
                 even when the file is otherwise successfully uploaded.

                 Set  the  value  to  ENABLE_NO_OP to have the Transfer Family
                 server ignore the SETSTAT command, and upload  files  without
                 needing  to  make  any changes to your SFTP client. While the
                 SetStatOption  ENABLE_NO_OP setting  ignores  the  error,  it
                 does  generate  a log entry in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so you
                 can determine when the client is making a SETSTAT call.

                 NOTE:
                     If you want to preserve the original timestamp  for  your
                     file,  and  modify  other file attributes using SETSTAT ,
                     you can use Amazon EFS as backend storage  with  Transfer
                     Family.

              As2Transports -> (list)
                 Indicates  the  transport  method  for the AS2 messages. Cur-
                 rently, only HTTP is supported.

                 (string)

          Domain -> (string)
              Specifies the domain of the storage system that is used for file
              transfers.

          EndpointDetails -> (structure)
              The  virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are con-
              figured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your
              VPC,  you  can  make  your endpoint accessible only to resources
              within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make
              your  endpoint  accessible  to  clients  over the internet. Your
              VPC's default security groups are automatically assigned to your
              endpoint.

              AddressAllocationIds -> (list)
                 A  list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach
                 an Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC and it is only valid in the UpdateServer API.

                 (string)

              SubnetIds -> (list)
                 A  list  of  subnet IDs that are required to host your server
                 endpoint in your VPC.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

                 (string)

              VpcEndpointId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the VPC endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC_ENDPOINT .

                     For           more            information,            see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The VPC identifier of the VPC in which  a  server's  endpoint
                 will be hosted.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 A list of security groups IDs that are available to attach to
                 your server's endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

                     You  can  edit  the  SecurityGroupIds  property  in   the
                     UpdateServer  API  only if you are changing the Endpoint-
                     Type from PUBLIC or VPC_ENDPOINT to VPC . To change secu-
                     rity  groups  associated  with your server's VPC endpoint
                     after creation, use the Amazon EC2 ModifyVpcEndpoint API.

                 (string)

          EndpointType -> (string)
              Defines the type of endpoint that your server is  connected  to.
              If your server is connected to a VPC endpoint, your server isn't
              accessible over the public internet.

          HostKeyFingerprint -> (string)
              Specifies the Base64-encoded SHA256 fingerprint of the  server's
              host key. This value is equivalent to the output of the ssh-key-
              gen -l -f my-new-server-key command.

          IdentityProviderDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies information to call a customer-supplied authentication
              API.  This  field is not populated when the IdentityProviderType
              of a server is AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or SERVICE_MANAGED .

              Url -> (string)
                 Provides the location of the service endpoint used to authen-
                 ticate users.

              InvocationRole -> (string)
                 Provides  the type of InvocationRole used to authenticate the
                 user account.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Directory Service  directory  that  you
                 want to stop sharing.

              Function -> (string)
                 The  ARN  for  a  lambda  function  to  use  for the Identity
                 provider.

          IdentityProviderType -> (string)
              The mode of authentication for a server. The  default  value  is
              SERVICE_MANAGED , which allows you to store and access user cre-
              dentials within the Transfer Family service.

              Use AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active  Directory
              groups  in  Directory  Service for Microsoft Active Directory or
              Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in
              Amazon  Web  Services  using  AD Connector. This option also re-
              quires you to provide  a  Directory  ID  by  using  the  Identi-
              tyProviderDetails parameter.

              Use the API_GATEWAY value to integrate with an identity provider
              of your choosing. The API_GATEWAY setting requires you  to  pro-
              vide  an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentica-
              tion by using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter.

              Use the AWS_LAMBDA value to directly use an Lambda  function  as
              your identity provider. If you choose this value, you must spec-
              ify the ARN for the Lambda function in the Function parameter or
              the IdentityProviderDetails data type.

          LoggingRole -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Man-
              agement (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon Cloud-
              Watch  logging  for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFSevents. When set, you
              can view user activity in your CloudWatch logs.

          PostAuthenticationLoginBanner -> (string)
              Specifies a string to display when users connect  to  a  server.
              This string is displayed after the user authenticates.

              NOTE:
                 The  SFTP  protocol does not support post-authentication dis-
                 play banners.

          PreAuthenticationLoginBanner -> (string)
              Specifies a string to display when users connect  to  a  server.
              This  string is displayed before the user authenticates. For ex-
              ample, the following banner displays  details  about  using  the
              system:
                 This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individ-
                 uals using this computer system without authority, or in  ex-
                 cess  of  their authority, are subject to having all of their
                 activities on this system monitored and  recorded  by  system
                 personnel.

          Protocols -> (list)
              Specifies  the  file  transfer  protocol or protocols over which
              your file transfer protocol client can connect to your  server's
              endpoint. The available protocols are:

              o SFTP  (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File trans-
                fer over SSH

              o FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer  with  TLS
                encryption

              o FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer

              o AS2  (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting struc-
                tured business-to-business data

              NOTE:

                 o If you select FTPS , you must choose a  certificate  stored
                   in Certificate Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your
                   server when clients connect to it over FTPS.

                 o If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS  ,  then  the  End-
                   pointType  must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must be
                   AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or API_GATEWAY .

                 o If Protocol includes FTP , then AddressAllocationIds cannot
                   be associated.

                 o If  Protocol  is set only to SFTP , the EndpointType can be
                   set to PUBLIC and the IdentityProviderType can  be  set  to
                   SERVICE_MANAGED .

                 o If  Protocol  includes  AS2 , then the EndpointType must be
                   VPC , and domain must be Amazon S3.

              (string)

          SecurityPolicyName -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the security policy that  is  attached  to
              the server.

          ServerId -> (string)
              Specifies  the  unique  system-assigned  identifier for a server
              that you instantiate.

          State -> (string)
              The condition of the server that was described. A value  of  ON-
              LINE  indicates  that  the  server  can accept jobs and transfer
              files. A State value of OFFLINE means  that  the  server  cannot
              perform file transfer operations.

              The  states of STARTING and STOPPING indicate that the server is
              in an intermediate state, either not fully able to  respond,  or
              not fully offline. The values of START_FAILED or STOP_FAILED can
              indicate an error condition.

          Tags -> (list)
              Specifies the key-value pairs that you can use to search for and
              group  servers  that  were  assigned  to the server that was de-
              scribed.

              (structure)
                 Creates a key-value pair for a specific  resource.  Tags  are
                 metadata  that you can use to search for and group a resource
                 for various purposes. You can apply tags to  servers,  users,
                 and  roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate a tag called Group and assign the values Research and Ac-
                 counting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains one or more values that you assigned to the  key
                     name you create.

          UserCount -> (integer)
              Specifies  the number of users that are assigned to a server you
              specified with the ServerId .

          WorkflowDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the ex-
              ecution role that's used for executing the workflow.

              In additon to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded com-
              pletely, WorkflowDeatails can also contain a  workflow  ID  (and
              execution  role)  for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A
              partial upload occurs when a file is open when the session  dis-
              connects.

              OnUpload -> (list)
                 A trigger that starts a workflow: the workflow begins to exe-
                 cute after a file is uploaded.

                 To remove an associated workflow from a server, you can  pro-
                 vide an empty OnUpload object, as in the following example.
                     aws        transfer       update-server       --server-id
                     s-01234567890abcdef --workflow-details '{"OnUpload":[]}'

                 (structure)
                     Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign  and
                     the  execution  role  that's used for executing the work-
                     flow.

                     In additon to a workflow to execute when a  file  is  up-
                     loaded  completely,  WorkflowDeatails  can also contain a
                     workflow ID (and execution role) for a workflow  to  exe-
                     cute  on  partial  upload. A partial upload occurs when a
                     file is open when the session disconnects.

                     WorkflowId -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the workflow.

                     ExecutionRole -> (string)
                        Includes the necessary permissions for  S3,  EFS,  and
                        Lambda  operations  that  Transfer can assume, so that
                        all workflow steps can operate  on  the  required  re-
                        sources

              OnPartialUpload -> (list)
                 A  trigger that starts a workflow if a file is only partially
                 uploaded. You can attach a workflow to a server that executes
                 whenever there is a partial upload.

                 A  partial upload occurs when a file is open when the session
                 disconnects.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign  and
                     the  execution  role  that's used for executing the work-
                     flow.

                     In additon to a workflow to execute when a  file  is  up-
                     loaded  completely,  WorkflowDeatails  can also contain a
                     workflow ID (and execution role) for a workflow  to  exe-
                     cute  on  partial  upload. A partial upload occurs when a
                     file is open when the session disconnects.

                     WorkflowId -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the workflow.

                     ExecutionRole -> (string)
                        Includes the necessary permissions for  S3,  EFS,  and
                        Lambda  operations  that  Transfer can assume, so that
                        all workflow steps can operate  on  the  required  re-
