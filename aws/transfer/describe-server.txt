DESCRIBE-SERVER()                                            DESCRIBE-SERVER()



NAME
       describe-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  file transfer protocol-enabled server that you specify by
       passing the ServerId parameter.

       The response contains a description of a server's properties. When  you
       set  EndpointType to VPC, the response will contain the EndpointDetails
       .

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Server -> (structure)
          An array containing the properties of a server with the ServerID you
          specified.

          Arn -> (string)
              Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the server.

          Certificate -> (string)
              Specifies  the ARN of the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager
              (ACM) certificate. Required when Protocols is set to FTPS .

          ProtocolDetails -> (structure)
              The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

              o To indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the
                PassiveIp  parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address,
                such as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load
                balancer.

              o To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts
                to use the SETSTAT command on a file that you are uploading to
                an  Amazon S3 bucket, use the SetStatOption parameter. To have
                the Transfer Family server ignore the SETSTAT command and  up-
                load  files  without  needing to make any changes to your SFTP
                client, set the value to ENABLE_NO_OP . If you  set  the  Set-
                StatOption  parameter to ENABLE_NO_OP , Transfer Family gener-
                ates a log entry to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so  that  you  can
                determine when the client is making a SETSTAT call.

              o To  determine  whether your Transfer Family server resumes re-
                cent, negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the
                TlsSessionResumptionMode parameter.

              o As2Transports  indicates the transport method for the AS2 mes-
                sages. Currently, only HTTP is supported.

              PassiveIp -> (string)
                 Indicates passive mode, for FTP and FTPS protocols.  Enter  a
                 single IPv4 address, such as the public IP address of a fire-
                 wall, router, or load balancer. For example:
                     aws  transfer   update-server   --protocol-details   Pas-
                     siveIp=0.0.0.0

                 Replace  0.0.0.0  in the example above with the actual IP ad-
                 dress you want to use.

                 NOTE:
                        If you change the PassiveIp value, you must  stop  and
                        then  restart  your  Transfer  Family  server  for the
                        change to take effect. For details  on  using  passive
                        mode (PASV) in a NAT environment, see Configuring your
                        FTPS server behind a firewall  or  NAT  with  Transfer
                        Family .

                     Special values

                 The AUTO and 0.0.0.0 are special values for the PassiveIp pa-
                 rameter. The value PassiveIp=AUTO is assigned by  default  to
                 FTP and FTPS type servers. In this case, the server automati-
                 cally responds with one of the endpoint IPs within  the  PASV
                 response. PassiveIp=0.0.0.0 has a more unique application for
                 its usage. For example, if you have a High Availability  (HA)
                 Network  Load  Balancer  (NLB)  environment, where you have 3
                 subnets, you can only specify a single IP address  using  the
                 PassiveIp parameter. This reduces the effectiveness of having
                 High  Availability.  In  this  case,  you  can  specify  Pas-
                 siveIp=0.0.0.0 . This tells the client to use the same IP ad-
                 dress as the Control connection and utilize all AZs for their
                 connections.  Note, however, that not all FTP clients support
                 the PassiveIp=0.0.0.0 response. FileZilla and WinSCP do  sup-
                 port it. If you are using other clients, check to see if your
                 client supports the PassiveIp=0.0.0.0 response.

              TlsSessionResumptionMode -> (string)
                 A property used with Transfer Family  servers  that  use  the
                 FTPS protocol. TLS Session Resumption provides a mechanism to
                 resume or share a negotiated secret key between  the  control
                 and  data  connection  for an FTPS session. TlsSessionResump-
                 tionMode determines whether or not the server resumes recent,
                 negotiated  sessions  through a unique session ID. This prop-
                 erty is available during CreateServer and UpdateServer calls.
                 If  a  TlsSessionResumptionMode value is not specified during
                 CreateServer , it is set to ENFORCED by default.

                 o DISABLED : the server does not process TLS session  resump-
                   tion client requests and creates a new TLS session for each
                   request.

                 o ENABLED : the server processes and accepts clients that are
                   performing  TLS  session resumption. The server doesn't re-
                   ject client data connections that do not  perform  the  TLS
                   session resumption client processing.

                 o ENFORCED  :  the  server processes and accepts clients that
                   are performing TLS session resumption. The  server  rejects
                   client data connections that do not perform the TLS session
                   resumption client processing. Before you set the  value  to
                   ENFORCED , test your clients.

                 NOTE:
                     Not  all FTPS clients perform TLS session resumption. So,
                     if you choose to enforce TLS session resumption, you pre-
                     vent any connections from FTPS clients that don't perform
                     the protocol negotiation. To determine whether or not you
                     can  use  the  ENFORCED  value,  you  need  to  test your
                     clients.

              SetStatOption -> (string)
                 Use the SetStatOption to ignore the error that  is  generated
                 when the client attempts to use SETSTAT on a file you are up-
                 loading to an S3 bucket.

                 Some SFTP file transfer clients can attempt to change the at-
                 tributes  of  remote  files,  including timestamp and permis-
                 sions, using commands, such as  SETSTAT  when  uploading  the
                 file.  However, these commands are not compatible with object
                 storage systems, such as Amazon S3. Due to this incompatibil-
                 ity,  file  uploads  from  these clients can result in errors
                 even when the file is otherwise successfully uploaded.

                 Set the value to ENABLE_NO_OP to  have  the  Transfer  Family
                 server  ignore  the SETSTAT command, and upload files without
                 needing to make any changes to your SFTP  client.  While  the
                 SetStatOption   ENABLE_NO_OP  setting  ignores  the error, it
                 does generate a log entry in Amazon CloudWatch Logs,  so  you
                 can determine when the client is making a SETSTAT call.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you  want to preserve the original timestamp for your
                     file, and modify other file attributes  using  SETSTAT  ,
                     you  can  use Amazon EFS as backend storage with Transfer
                     Family.

              As2Transports -> (list)
                 Indicates the transport method for  the  AS2  messages.  Cur-
                 rently, only HTTP is supported.

                 (string)

          Domain -> (string)
              Specifies the domain of the storage system that is used for file
              transfers. There are two domains available: Amazon Simple  Stor-
              age  Service  (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon
              EFS). The default value is S3.

          EndpointDetails -> (structure)
              The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are  con-
              figured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your
              VPC, you can make your endpoint  accessible  only  to  resources
              within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make
              your endpoint accessible to  clients  over  the  internet.  Your
              VPC's default security groups are automatically assigned to your
              endpoint.

              AddressAllocationIds -> (list)
                 A list of address allocation IDs that are required to  attach
                 an Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

                 An  address allocation ID corresponds to the allocation ID of
                 an Elastic IP address. This value can be retrieved  from  the
                 allocationId field from the Amazon EC2 Address data type. One
                 way  to  retrieve  this  value  is   by   calling   the   EC2
                 DescribeAddresses API.

                 This parameter is optional. Set this parameter if you want to
                 make your VPC endpoint public-facing. For details, see Create
                 an internet-facing endpoint for your server .

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set as follows:

                     o EndpointType must be set to VPC

                     o The Transfer Family server must be offline.

                     o You  cannot  set  this  parameter  for  Transfer Family
                       servers that use the FTP protocol.

                     o The server must already have SubnetIds populated  (Sub-
                       netIds  and  AddressAllocationIds cannot be updated si-
                       multaneously).

                     o AddressAllocationIds can't contain duplicates, and must
                       be  equal  in length to SubnetIds . For example, if you
                       have three subnet IDs, you must also specify three  ad-
                       dress allocation IDs.

                     o Call the UpdateServer API to set or change this parame-
                       ter.

                 (string)

              SubnetIds -> (list)
                 A list of subnet IDs that are required to  host  your  server
                 endpoint in your VPC.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

                 (string)

              VpcEndpointId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the VPC endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC_ENDPOINT .

                     For            more            information,           see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  VPC  identifier  of the VPC in which a server's endpoint
                 will be hosted.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 A list of security groups IDs that are available to attach to
                 your server's endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

                     You   can  edit  the  SecurityGroupIds  property  in  the
                     UpdateServer API only if you are changing  the  Endpoint-
                     Type from PUBLIC or VPC_ENDPOINT to VPC . To change secu-
                     rity groups associated with your  server's  VPC  endpoint
                     after creation, use the Amazon EC2 ModifyVpcEndpoint API.

                 (string)

          EndpointType -> (string)
              Defines  the  type of endpoint that your server is connected to.
              If your server is connected to a VPC endpoint, your server isn't
              accessible over the public internet.

          HostKeyFingerprint -> (string)
              Specifies  the Base64-encoded SHA256 fingerprint of the server's
              host key. This value is equivalent to the output of the ssh-key-
              gen -l -f my-new-server-key command.

          IdentityProviderDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies information to call a customer-supplied authentication
              API. This field is not populated when  the  IdentityProviderType
              of a server is AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or SERVICE_MANAGED .

              Url -> (string)
                 Provides the location of the service endpoint used to authen-
                 ticate users.

              InvocationRole -> (string)
                 This parameter is only applicable if  your  IdentityProvider-
                 Type  is  API_GATEWAY  .  Provides the type of InvocationRole
                 used to authenticate the user account.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Directory Service  directory  that  you
                 want to use as your identity provider.

              Function -> (string)
                 The  ARN  for  a  Lambda  function  to  use  for the Identity
                 provider.

              SftpAuthenticationMethods -> (string)
                 For SFTP-enabled servers, and for custom  identity  providers
                 only  , you can specify whether to authenticate using a pass-
                 word, SSH key pair, or both.

                 o PASSWORD - users must provide their password to connect.

                 o PUBLIC_KEY - users must provide their private key  to  con-
                   nect.

                 o PUBLIC_KEY_OR_PASSWORD - users can authenticate with either
                   their password or their key. This is the default value.

                 o PUBLIC_KEY_AND_PASSWORD - users  must  provide  both  their
                   private  key  and  their  password  to  connect. The server
                   checks the key first, and then if the  key  is  valid,  the
                   system  prompts for a password. If the private key provided
                   does not match the public key that is  stored,  authentica-
                   tion fails.

          IdentityProviderType -> (string)
              The  mode  of  authentication for a server. The default value is
              SERVICE_MANAGED , which allows you to store and access user cre-
              dentials within the Transfer Family service.

              Use  AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active Directory
              groups in Directory Service for Microsoft  Active  Directory  or
              Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in
              Amazon Web Services using AD Connector.  This  option  also  re-
              quires  you  to  provide  a  Directory  ID  by using the Identi-
              tyProviderDetails parameter.

              Use the API_GATEWAY value to integrate with an identity provider
              of  your  choosing. The API_GATEWAY setting requires you to pro-
              vide an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for  authentica-
              tion by using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter.

              Use  the  AWS_LAMBDA value to directly use an Lambda function as
              your identity provider. If you choose this value, you must spec-
              ify  the  ARN  for the Lambda function in the Function parameter
              for the IdentityProviderDetails data type.

          LoggingRole -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and  Access  Man-
              agement (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon Cloud-
              Watch logging for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFSevents. When  set,  you
              can view user activity in your CloudWatch logs.

          PostAuthenticationLoginBanner -> (string)
              Specifies  a  string  to display when users connect to a server.
              This string is displayed after the user authenticates.

              NOTE:
                 The SFTP protocol does not support  post-authentication  dis-
                 play banners.

          PreAuthenticationLoginBanner -> (string)
              Specifies  a  string  to display when users connect to a server.
              This string is displayed before the user authenticates. For  ex-
              ample,  the  following  banner  displays details about using the
              system:
                 This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individ-
                 uals  using this computer system without authority, or in ex-
                 cess of their authority, are subject to having all  of  their
                 activities  on  this  system monitored and recorded by system
                 personnel.

          Protocols -> (list)
              Specifies the file transfer protocol  or  protocols  over  which
              your  file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's
              endpoint. The available protocols are:

              o SFTP (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File  trans-
                fer over SSH

              o FTPS  (File  Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS
                encryption

              o FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer

              o AS2 (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting  struc-
                tured business-to-business data

              NOTE:

                 o If  you  select FTPS , you must choose a certificate stored
                   in Certificate Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your
                   server when clients connect to it over FTPS.

                 o If  Protocol  includes  either  FTP or FTPS , then the End-
                   pointType must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must  be
                   either  AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE , AWS_LAMBDA , or API_GATEWAY
                   .

                 o If Protocol includes FTP , then AddressAllocationIds cannot
                   be associated.

                 o If  Protocol  is set only to SFTP , the EndpointType can be
                   set to PUBLIC and the IdentityProviderType can be  set  any
                   of  the supported identity types: SERVICE_MANAGED , AWS_DI-
                   RECTORY_SERVICE , AWS_LAMBDA , or API_GATEWAY .

                 o If Protocol includes AS2 , then the  EndpointType  must  be
                   VPC , and domain must be Amazon S3.

              (string)

          SecurityPolicyName -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the security policy for the server.

          ServerId -> (string)
              Specifies  the  unique  system-assigned  identifier for a server
              that you instantiate.

          State -> (string)
              The condition of the server that was described. A value  of  ON-
              LINE  indicates  that  the  server  can accept jobs and transfer
              files. A State value of OFFLINE means  that  the  server  cannot
              perform file transfer operations.

              The  states of STARTING and STOPPING indicate that the server is
              in an intermediate state, either not fully able to  respond,  or
              not fully offline. The values of START_FAILED or STOP_FAILED can
              indicate an error condition.

          Tags -> (list)
              Specifies the key-value pairs that you can use to search for and
              group  servers  that  were  assigned  to the server that was de-
              scribed.

              (structure)
                 Creates a key-value pair for a specific  resource.  Tags  are
                 metadata  that you can use to search for and group a resource
                 for various purposes. You can apply tags to  servers,  users,
                 and  roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate a tag called Group and assign the values Research and Ac-
                 counting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains one or more values that you assigned to the  key
                     name you create.

          UserCount -> (integer)
              Specifies  the number of users that are assigned to a server you
              specified with the ServerId .

          WorkflowDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the ex-
              ecution role that's used for executing the workflow.

              In  addition  to  a  workflow to execute when a file is uploaded
              completely, WorkflowDetails can also contain a workflow ID  (and
              execution  role)  for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A
              partial upload occurs when the server session disconnects  while
              the file is still being uploaded.

              OnUpload -> (list)
                 A trigger that starts a workflow: the workflow begins to exe-
                 cute after a file is uploaded.

                 To remove an associated workflow from a server, you can  pro-
                 vide an empty OnUpload object, as in the following example.
                     aws        transfer       update-server       --server-id
                     s-01234567890abcdef --workflow-details '{"OnUpload":[]}'

                 (structure)
                     Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign  and
                     the  execution  role  that's used for executing the work-
                     flow.

                     In addition to a workflow to execute when a file  is  up-
                     loaded  completely,  WorkflowDetails  can  also contain a
                     workflow ID (and execution role) for a workflow  to  exe-
                     cute  on partial upload. A partial upload occurs when the
                     server session disconnects while the file is still  being
                     uploaded.

                     WorkflowId -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the workflow.

                     ExecutionRole -> (string)
                        Includes  the  necessary  permissions for S3, EFS, and
                        Lambda operations that Transfer can  assume,  so  that
                        all  workflow  steps  can  operate on the required re-
                        sources

              OnPartialUpload -> (list)
                 A trigger that starts a workflow if a file is only  partially
                 uploaded. You can attach a workflow to a server that executes
                 whenever there is a partial upload.

                 A partial upload occurs when a file is open when the  session
                 disconnects.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies  the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and
                     the execution role that's used for  executing  the  work-
                     flow.

                     In  addition  to a workflow to execute when a file is up-
                     loaded completely, WorkflowDetails  can  also  contain  a
                     workflow  ID  (and execution role) for a workflow to exe-
                     cute on partial upload. A partial upload occurs when  the
                     server  session disconnects while the file is still being
                     uploaded.

                     WorkflowId -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the workflow.

                     ExecutionRole -> (string)
                        Includes the necessary permissions for  S3,  EFS,  and
                        Lambda  operations  that  Transfer can assume, so that
                        all workflow steps can operate  on  the  required  re-
                        sources

          StructuredLogDestinations -> (list)
              Specifies the log groups to which your server logs are sent.

              To specify a log group, you must provide the ARN for an existing
              log group. In this case, the format of the log group is as  fol-
              lows:
                 arn:aws:logs:region-name:amazon-ac-
                 count-id:log-group:log-group-name:*

              For                                                     example,
              arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:mytestgroup:*

              If  you  have previously specified a log group for a server, you
              can clear it, and in effect turn off structured logging, by pro-
              viding  an  empty  value  for this parameter in an update-server
              call. For example:
                 update-server   --server-id   s-1234567890abcdef0    --struc-
                 tured-log-destinations

              (string)

          S3StorageOptions -> (structure)
              Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3 directo-
              ries is optimized. This is disabled by default.

              By default, home directory mappings have a TYPE of  DIRECTORY  .
              If you enable this option, you would then need to explicitly set
              the HomeDirectoryMapEntry  Type to FILE if you want a mapping to
              have a file target.

              DirectoryListingOptimization -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  or not performance for your Amazon S3 di-
                 rectories is optimized. This is disabled by default.

                 By default, home directory mappings have a TYPE of  DIRECTORY
                 .  If  you enable this option, you would then need to explic-
                 itly set the HomeDirectoryMapEntry  Type to FILE if you  want
                 a mapping to have a file target.

          As2ServiceManagedEgressIpAddresses -> (list)
              The  list  of  egress  IP addresses of this server. These IP ad-
              dresses are only relevant for servers that use the AS2 protocol.
              They are used for sending asynchronous MDNs.

              These IP addresses are assigned automatically when you create an
              AS2 server. Additionally, if you update an existing  server  and
              add the AS2 protocol, static IP addresses are assigned as well.

              (string)



                                                             DESCRIBE-SERVER()
