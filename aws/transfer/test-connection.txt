TEST-CONNECTION()                                            TEST-CONNECTION()



NAME
       test-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests  whether  your  SFTP  connector is set up successfully. We highly
       recommend that you call this operation to test your ability to transfer
       files  between  a  Transfer  Family server and a trading partner's SFTP
       server.

OPTIONS
       --connector-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the connector.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ConnectorId -> (string)
          Returns the identifier of the connector object that you are testing.

       Status -> (string)
          Returns OK for successful test, or ERROR if the test fails.

       StatusMessage -> (string)
          Returns  Connection succeeded if the test is successful. Or, returns
          a descriptive error message if the test fails.  The  following  list
          provides  the  details  for  some error messages and troubleshooting
          steps for each.

          o Unable to access secrets manager : Verify that  your  secret  name
            aligns with the one in Transfer Role permissions.

          o Unknown Host/Connection failed : Verify the server URL in the con-
            nector configuration , and verify that the login credentials  work
            successfully outside of the connector.

          o Private  key not found : Verify that the secret exists and is for-
            matted correctly.

          o Invalid trusted host keys : Verify that the trusted  host  key  in
            the connector configuration matches the ssh-keyscan output.
