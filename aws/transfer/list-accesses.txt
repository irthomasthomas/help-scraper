LIST-ACCESSES()                                                LIST-ACCESSES()



NAME
       list-accesses -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the details for all the accesses you have on your server.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-accesses  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Accesses

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has users  as-
          signed to it.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When  you  can  get additional results from the ListAccesses call, a
          NextToken parameter is returned in the output. You can then pass  in
          a  subsequent command to the NextToken parameter to continue listing
          additional accesses.

       ServerId -> (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has users  as-
          signed to it.

       Accesses -> (list)
          Returns  the  accesses  and  their properties for the ServerId value
          that you specify.

          (structure)
              Lists the properties for one or more  specified  associated  ac-
              cesses.

              HomeDirectory -> (string)
                 The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to
                 the server using the client.

                 A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

                 NOTE:
                     The HomeDirectory parameter is only used if  HomeDirecto-
                     ryType is set to PATH .

              HomeDirectoryType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  landing  directory (folder) that you want your
                 users' home directory to be when they log in to  the  server.
                 If you set it to PATH , the user will see the absolute Amazon
                 S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is  in  their  file  transfer
                 protocol clients. If you set it to LOGICAL , you need to pro-
                 vide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how  you  want
                 to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.

                 NOTE:
                     If  HomeDirectoryType  is LOGICAL , you must provide map-
                     pings, using the HomeDirectoryMappings parameter. If,  on
                     the  other  hand, HomeDirectoryType is PATH , you provide
                     an absolute path using the HomeDirectory  parameter.  You
                     cannot  have both HomeDirectory and HomeDirectoryMappings
                     in your template.

              Role -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Identity  and  Access
                 Management  (IAM)  role  that  controls your users' access to
                 your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies
                 attached  to this role determine the level of access that you
                 want to provide your users when transferring files  into  and
                 out  of  your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The
                 IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows
                 the  server  to  access  your  resources  when servicing your
                 users' transfer requests.

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier that is  required  to  identify  specific
                 groups within your directory. The users of the group that you
                 associate have access to your Amazon S3  or  Amazon  EFS  re-
                 sources  over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. If
                 you know the group name, you can view the SID values by  run-
                 ning the following command using Windows PowerShell.
                     Get-ADGroup  -Filter  {samAccountName  -like "*YourGroup-
                     Name* *"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid

                 In that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of  your
                 Active Directory group.

                 The  regular  expression used to validate this parameter is a
                 string of characters consisting of  uppercase  and  lowercase
                 alphanumeric  characters with no spaces. You can also include
                 underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-
