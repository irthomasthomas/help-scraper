LIST-ACCESSES()                                                LIST-ACCESSES()



NAME
       list-accesses -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the details for all the accesses you have on your server.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-accesses  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Accesses

SYNOPSIS
            list-accesses
          --server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has users  as-
          signed to it.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When  you  can  get additional results from the ListAccesses call, a
          NextToken parameter is returned in the output. You can then pass  in
          a  subsequent command to the NextToken parameter to continue listing
          additional accesses.

       ServerId -> (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has users  as-
          signed to it.

       Accesses -> (list)
          Returns  the  accesses  and  their properties for the ServerId value
          that you specify.

          (structure)
              Lists the properties for one or more  specified  associated  ac-
              cesses.

              HomeDirectory -> (string)
                 The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to
                 the server using the client.

                 A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

              HomeDirectoryType -> (string)
                 The type of landing directory (folder) you want  your  users'
                 home  directory  to  be when they log into the server. If you
                 set it to PATH , the user will see  the  absolute  Amazon  S3
                 bucket  or  EFS  paths  as is in their file transfer protocol
                 clients. If you set it LOGICAL , you need to provide mappings
                 in  the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon
                 S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.

              Role -> (string)
                 Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 controls  your  users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS
                 file system. The policies attached to this role determine the
                 level  of  access  that  you  want to provide your users when
                 transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3  bucket  or
                 EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust re-
                 lationship that allows the server to  access  your  resources
                 when servicing your users' transfer requests.

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  that  is required to identify specific
                 groups within your directory. The users of the group that you
                 associate  have  access  to  your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS re-
                 sources over the enabled protocols using Amazon Web  Services
                 Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the
                 SID values by running the  following  command  using  Windows
                 PowerShell.
                     Get-ADGroup  -Filter  {samAccountName  -like "*YourGroup-
                     Name* *"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid

                 In that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of  your
                 Active Directory group.

                 The  regex  used  to  validate  this parameter is a string of
                 characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric
                 characters  with  no spaces. You can also include underscores
                 or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-
