OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          Provide the ID of the server that contains the  host  key  that  you
          want described.

       --host-key-id (string)
          Provide the ID of the host key that you want described.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       HostKey -> (structure)
          Returns the details for the specified host key.

          Arn -> (string)
              The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the host key.

          HostKeyId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the host key.

          HostKeyFingerprint -> (string)
              The public key fingerprint, which is a short sequence  of  bytes
              used to identify the longer public key.

          Description -> (string)
              The text description for this host key.

          Type -> (string)
              The  encryption algorithm used for the host key. The Type is one

              o ssh-ed25519

              o ecdsa-sha2-nistp256

              o ecdsa-sha2-nistp384

              o ecdsa-sha2-nistp521

          DateImported -> (timestamp)
              The date on which the host key was added to the server.

          Tags -> (list)
              Key-value pairs that can be used to group and  search  for  host
              keys.

              (structure)
                 Creates  a  key-value  pair for a specific resource. Tags are
                 metadata that you can use to search for and group a  resource
                 for  various  purposes. You can apply tags to servers, users,
                 and roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For  exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate a tag called Group and assign the values Research and Ac-
                 counting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains  one or more values that you assigned to the key
