SYNOPSIS
            create-profile
          --as2-id <value>
          --profile-type <value>
          [--certificate-ids <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --as2-id (string)
          The As2Id is the AS2-name , as defined in the  defined  in  the  RFC
          4130  .  For  inbound transfers, this is the AS2-From header for the
          AS2 messages sent from the partner. For outbound connectors, this is
          the AS2-To header for the AS2 messages sent to the partner using the
          StartFileTransfer API operation. This ID cannot include spaces.

       --profile-type (string)
          Indicates whether to list only LOCAL type profiles or  only  PARTNER
          type profiles. If not supplied in the request, the command lists all
          types of profiles.

          Possible values:

          o LOCAL

          o PARTNER

       --certificate-ids (list)
          An array of identifiers for the imported certificates. You use  this
          identifier for working with profiles and partner profiles.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          Key-value  pairs  that  can be used to group and search for AS2 pro-
          files.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data  that  you  can  use to search for and group a resource for
              various purposes. You can apply  tags  to  servers,  users,  and
              roles.  A  tag key can take more than one value. For example, to
              group servers for accounting purposes, you might  create  a  tag
              called  Group  and  assign the values Research and Accounting to
              that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 you create.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProfileId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the AS2 profile, returned  after  the  API
          call succeeds.
