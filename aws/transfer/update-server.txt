OPTIONS
       --certificate (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate
          Manager (ACM) certificate. Required when Protocols is set to FTPS .

          To  request  a new public certificate, see Request a public certifi-
          cate in the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager User Guide .

          To import an existing certificate into ACM, see  Importing  certifi-
          cates  into  ACM  in the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager User
          Guide .

          To request a private certificate to use FTPS through private IP  ad-
          dresses,  see  Request  a private certificate in the Amazon Web Ser-
          vicesCertificate Manager User Guide .

          Certificates with the following  cryptographic  algorithms  and  key
          sizes are supported:

          o 2048-bit RSA (RSA_2048)

          o 4096-bit RSA (RSA_4096)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 256 bit (EC_prime256v1)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 384 bit (EC_secp384r1)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 521 bit (EC_secp521r1)

          NOTE:
              The certificate must be a valid SSL/TLS X.509 version 3 certifi-
              cate with FQDN or IP address specified and information about the
              issuer.

       --protocol-details (structure)
          The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

          o Use  the PassiveIp parameter to indicate passive mode (for FTP and
            FTPS protocols). Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such  as
            the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer.

          o Use  the  SetStatOption to ignore the error that is generated when
            the client attempts to use SETSTAT on a file you are uploading  to
            an  S3  bucket. Set the value to ENABLE_NO_OP to have the Transfer
            Family server ignore the SETSTAT command, and upload files without
            needing  to  make  any changes to your SFTP client. Note that with
            SetStatOption set to ENABLE_NO_OP , Transfer generates a log entry
            to CloudWatch Logs, so you can determine when the client is making
            a SETSTAT call.

          o Use the TlsSessionResumptionMode parameter to determine whether or
            not  your  Transfer  server  resumes  recent,  negotiated sessions
            through a unique session ID.

          PassiveIp -> (string)
              Indicates passive mode, for FTP and FTPS protocols. Enter a sin-
              gle  IPv4  address, such as the public IP address of a firewall,
              router, or load balancer. For example:

                 ``
                 aws   transfer    update-server    --protocol-details    Pas-
                 siveIp=*0.0.0.0* ``

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 131)
                        Inline literal start-string without end-string.

              Replace  ``  0.0.0.0  `` in the example above with the actual IP
              address you want to use.

              NOTE:
                 If you change the PassiveIp value, you  must  stop  and  then
                 restart  your  Transfer  Family server for the change to take
                 effect. For details on using passive mode (PASV) in a NAT en-
                 vironment, see Configuring your FTPS server behind a firewall
                 or NAT with Transfer Family .

          TlsSessionResumptionMode -> (string)
              A property used with Transfer Family servers that use  the  FTPS
              protocol.  TLS Session Resumption provides a mechanism to resume
              or share a negotiated secret key between the  control  and  data
              connection  for an FTPS session. TlsSessionResumptionMode deter-
              mines whether or not the server resumes recent, negotiated  ses-
              sions  through  a  unique session ID. This property is available
              during CreateServer and UpdateServer calls. If  a  TlsSessionRe-
              sumptionMode  value is not specified during CreateServer , it is
              set to ENFORCED by default.

              o DISABLED : the server does not process TLS session  resumption
                client  requests  and  creates  a new TLS session for each re-
                quest.

              o ENABLED : the server processes and accepts  clients  that  are
                performing  TLS  session resumption. The server doesn't reject
                client data connections that do not perform  the  TLS  session
                resumption client processing.

              o ENFORCED  :  the server processes and accepts clients that are
                performing TLS session resumption. The server  rejects  client
                data  connections  that do not perform the TLS session resump-
                tion client processing. Before you set the value to ENFORCED ,
                test your clients.

              NOTE:
                 Not  all  FTPS clients perform TLS session resumption. So, if
                 you choose to enforce TLS session resumption, you prevent any
                 connections from FTPS clients that don't perform the protocol
                 negotiation. To determine whether or not you can use the  EN-
                 FORCED value, you need to test your clients.

          SetStatOption -> (string)
              Use the SetStatOption to ignore the error that is generated when
              the client attempts to use SETSTAT on a file you  are  uploading
              to an S3 bucket.

              Some  SFTP  file  transfer clients can attempt to change the at-
              tributes of remote files, including timestamp  and  permissions,
              using  commands,  such  as SETSTAT when uploading the file. How-
              ever, these commands are not compatible with object storage sys-
              tems,  such  as Amazon S3. Due to this incompatibility, file up-
              loads from these clients can result in errors even when the file
              is otherwise successfully uploaded.

              Set the value to ENABLE_NO_OP to have the Transfer Family server
              ignore the SETSTAT command, and upload files without needing  to
              make  any  changes  to your SFTP client. While the SetStatOption
              ENABLE_NO_OP setting ignores the error, it does generate  a  log
              entry  in  Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so you can determine when the
              client is making a SETSTAT call.

              NOTE:
                 If you want to preserve the original timestamp for your file,
                 and  modify other file attributes using SETSTAT , you can use
                 Amazon EFS as backend storage with Transfer Family.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PassiveIp=string,TlsSessionResumptionMode=string,SetStatOption=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PassiveIp": "string",
            "TlsSessionResumptionMode": "DISABLED"|"ENABLED"|"ENFORCED",
            "SetStatOption": "DEFAULT"|"ENABLE_NO_OP"
          }

       --endpoint-details (structure)
          The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that  are  config-
          ured  for  your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC,
          you can make it accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you
          can  attach  Elastic  IP addresses and make it accessible to clients
          over the internet. Your VPC's default security groups are  automati-
          cally assigned to your endpoint.

          AddressAllocationIds -> (list)
              A  list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach an
              Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 and it is only valid in the UpdateServer API.

              (string)

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              A  list of subnet IDs that are required to host your server end-
              point in your VPC.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

              (string)

          VpcEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This  property  can  only  be set when EndpointType is set to
                 VPC_ENDPOINT .

                 For             more             information,             see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The VPC ID of the VPC in  which  a  server's  endpoint  will  be
              hosted.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              A list of security groups IDs that are available  to  attach  to
              your server's endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

                 You  can  edit   the   SecurityGroupIds   property   in   the
                 UpdateServer  API  only  if you are changing the EndpointType
                 from PUBLIC or VPC_ENDPOINT  to  VPC  .  To  change  security
                 groups  associated with your server's VPC endpoint after cre-
                 ation, use the Amazon EC2 ModifyVpcEndpoint API.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AddressAllocationIds=string,string,SubnetIds=string,string,VpcEndpointId=string,VpcId=string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AddressAllocationIds": ["string", ...],
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "VpcEndpointId": "string",
            "VpcId": "string",
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --endpoint-type (string)
          The type of endpoint that you want  your  server  to  use.  You  can
          choose  to  make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC)
          or host it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that  is  hosted  in  a
          VPC,  you  can  restrict  access  to  your server and resources only
          within your VPC or choose to make it internet  facing  by  attaching
          Elastic IP addresses directly to it.

          NOTE:
              After  May  19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using
              EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount  if
              your  account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you
              have already created servers with  EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT  in
              your  Amazon  Web Servicesaccount on or before May 19, 2021, you
              will not be affected. After this date, use EndpointType =``VPC``
              .

              For              more              information,              see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

              It  is  recommended  that you use VPC as the EndpointType . With
              this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up
              to  three  Elastic  IPv4  addresses  (BYO IP included) with your
              server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict  traf-
              fic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with
              EndpointType set to VPC_ENDPOINT .

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC

          o VPC

          o VPC_ENDPOINT

       --host-key (string)
          The RSA, ECDSA, or ED25519 private key to use for your server.

          Use the following command to generate an RSA 2048 bit  key  with  no
          passphrase:
              ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key .

          Use  a  minimum  value  of  2048 for the -b option: you can create a
          stronger key using 3072 or 4096.

          Use the following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key  with  no
          passphrase:
              ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key .

          Valid values for the -b option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521.

          Use  the  following  command  to  generate  an  ED25519  key with no
          passphrase:
              ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key .

          For all of these commands, you can replace my-new-server-key with  a
          string of your choice.

          WARNING:
              If  you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an exist-
              ing SFTP-enabled server to a new server, don't update  the  host
              key.  Accidentally  changing  a server's host key can be disrup-
              tive.

          For more information, see Change the host key for your  SFTP-enabled
          server in the Amazon Web Services Transfer Family User Guide .

       --identity-provider-details (structure)
          An  array  containing all of the information required to call a cus-
          tomer's authentication API method.

          Url -> (string)
              Provides the location of the service endpoint used to  authenti-
              cate users.

          InvocationRole -> (string)
              Provides  the  type  of  InvocationRole used to authenticate the
              user account.

          DirectoryId -> (string)
              The identifier of the Amazon Web Services Directory Service  di-
              rectory that you want to stop sharing.

          Function -> (string)
              The ARN for a lambda function to use for the Identity provider.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Url=string,InvocationRole=string,DirectoryId=string,Function=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Url": "string",
            "InvocationRole": "string",
            "DirectoryId": "string",
            "Function": "string"
          }

       --logging-role (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services
          Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows  a  server  to
          turn  on  Amazon  CloudWatch  logging  for  Amazon  S3 or Amazon EFS
          events. When set, user activity can be  viewed  in  your  CloudWatch
          logs.

       --post-authentication-login-banner (string)
          Specify  a  string  to  display when users connect to a server. This
          string is displayed after the user authenticates.

          NOTE:
              The SFTP protocol does not support  post-authentication  display
              banners.

       --pre-authentication-login-banner (string)
          Specify  a  string  to  display when users connect to a server. This
          string is displayed before the user authenticates. For example,  the
          following banner displays details about using the system.
              This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals
              using this computer system without authority, or  in  excess  of
              their  authority,  are subject to having all of their activities
              on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel.

       --protocols (list)
          Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols  over  which  your
          file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint.
          The available protocols are:

          o Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol  (SFTP):  File  transfer
            over SSH

          o File  Transfer  Protocol Secure (FTPS): File transfer with TLS en-
            cryption

          o File Transfer Protocol (FTP): Unencrypted file transfer

          NOTE:
              If you select FTPS , you must choose  a  certificate  stored  in
              Amazon  Web ServicesCertificate Manager (ACM) which will be used
              to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS.

              If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS , then the  EndpointType
              must  be  VPC  and  the  IdentityProviderType must be AWS_DIREC-
              TORY_SERVICE or API_GATEWAY .

              If Protocol includes FTP , then AddressAllocationIds  cannot  be
              associated.

              If Protocol is set only to SFTP , the EndpointType can be set to
              PUBLIC and the IdentityProviderType can be set  to  SERVICE_MAN-
              AGED .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SFTP
            FTP
            FTPS

       --security-policy-name (string)
          Specifies  the  name  of the security policy that is attached to the
          server.

       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance  that  the
          user account is assigned to.

       --workflow-details (structure)
          Specifies  the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execu-
          tion role used for executing the workflow.

          To remove an associated workflow from a server, you can  provide  an
          empty OnUpload object, as in the following example.
              aws   transfer   update-server  --server-id  s-01234567890abcdef
              --workflow-details '{"OnUpload":[]}'

          OnUpload -> (list)
              A trigger that starts a workflow: the workflow begins to execute
              after a file is uploaded.

              To  remove an associated workflow from a server, you can provide
              an empty OnUpload object, as in the following example.

                 --workflow-details '{"OnUpload":[]}'

              (structure)
                 Specifies  the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the
                 execution role used for executing the workflow.

                 WorkflowId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the workflow.

                 ExecutionRole -> (string)
                     Includes the  necessary  permissions  for  S3,  EFS,  and
                     Lambda  operations  that Transfer can assume, so that all
                     workflow steps can operate on the required resources

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OnUpload=[{WorkflowId=string,ExecutionRole=string},{WorkflowId=string,ExecutionRole=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "OnUpload": [
              {
                "WorkflowId": "string",
                "ExecutionRole": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ServerId -> (string)
          A  system-assigned  unique identifier for a server that the user ac-
          count is assigned to.
