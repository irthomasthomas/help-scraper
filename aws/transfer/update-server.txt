OPTIONS
       --certificate (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate
          Manager (ACM) certificate. Required when Protocols is set to FTPS .

          To  request  a new public certificate, see Request a public certifi-
          cate in the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager User Guide .

          To import an existing certificate into ACM, see  Importing  certifi-
          cates  into  ACM  in the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager User
          Guide .

          To request a private certificate to use FTPS through private IP  ad-
          dresses,  see  Request  a private certificate in the Amazon Web Ser-
          vicesCertificate Manager User Guide .

          Certificates with the following  cryptographic  algorithms  and  key
          sizes are supported:

          o 2048-bit RSA (RSA_2048)

          o 4096-bit RSA (RSA_4096)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 256 bit (EC_prime256v1)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 384 bit (EC_secp384r1)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 521 bit (EC_secp521r1)

          NOTE:
              The certificate must be a valid SSL/TLS X.509 version 3 certifi-
              cate with FQDN or IP address specified and information about the
              issuer.

       --protocol-details (structure)
          The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

          o To  indicate  passive  mode  (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the
            PassiveIp parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such
            as  the  external  IP  address of a firewall, router, or load bal-
            ancer.

          o To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts  to
            use  the  SETSTAT  command  on a file that you are uploading to an
            Amazon S3 bucket, use the SetStatOption  parameter.  To  have  the
            Transfer Family server ignore the SETSTAT command and upload files
            without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client,  set  the
            value  to ENABLE_NO_OP . If you set the SetStatOption parameter to
            ENABLE_NO_OP , Transfer Family generates a  log  entry  to  Amazon
            CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is mak-
            ing a SETSTAT call.

          o To determine whether your Transfer Family server  resumes  recent,
            negotiated  sessions  through a unique session ID, use the TlsSes-
            sionResumptionMode parameter.

          o As2Transports indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages.
            Currently, only HTTP is supported.

          PassiveIp -> (string)
              Indicates passive mode, for FTP and FTPS protocols. Enter a sin-
              gle IPv4 address, such as the public IP address of  a  firewall,
              router, or load balancer. For example:
                 aws    transfer    update-server    --protocol-details   Pas-
                 siveIp=0.0.0.0

              Replace 0.0.0.0 in the example above with the actual IP  address
              you want to use.

              NOTE:
                     If you change the PassiveIp value, you must stop and then
                     restart your Transfer Family server  for  the  change  to
                     take  effect. For details on using passive mode (PASV) in
                     a NAT environment, see Configuring your FTPS  server  be-
                     hind a firewall or NAT with Transfer Family .

                 Special values

              The AUTO and 0.0.0.0 are special values for the PassiveIp param-
              eter. The value PassiveIp=AUTO is assigned by default to FTP and
              FTPS  type  servers.  In this case, the server automatically re-
              sponds with one of the endpoint IPs within  the  PASV  response.
              PassiveIp=0.0.0.0  has  a more unique application for its usage.
              For example, if you have a High Availability (HA)  Network  Load
              Balancer  (NLB)  environment,  where you have 3 subnets, you can
              only specify a single IP address using the PassiveIp  parameter.
              This  reduces  the effectiveness of having High Availability. In
              this case, you can specify PassiveIp=0.0.0.0 .  This  tells  the
              client  to use the same IP address as the Control connection and
              utilize all AZs for their connections. Note, however,  that  not
              all   FTP   clients   support  the  PassiveIp=0.0.0.0  response.
              FileZilla and WinSCP do support  it.  If  you  are  using  other
              clients,   check  to  see  if  your  client  supports  the  Pas-
              siveIp=0.0.0.0 response.

          TlsSessionResumptionMode -> (string)
              A property used with Transfer Family servers that use  the  FTPS
              protocol.  TLS Session Resumption provides a mechanism to resume
              or share a negotiated secret key between the  control  and  data
              connection  for an FTPS session. TlsSessionResumptionMode deter-
              mines whether or not the server resumes recent, negotiated  ses-
              sions  through  a  unique session ID. This property is available
              during CreateServer and UpdateServer calls. If  a  TlsSessionRe-
              sumptionMode  value is not specified during CreateServer , it is
              set to ENFORCED by default.

              o DISABLED : the server does not process TLS session  resumption
                client  requests  and  creates  a new TLS session for each re-
                quest.

              o ENABLED : the server processes and accepts  clients  that  are
                performing  TLS  session resumption. The server doesn't reject
                client data connections that do not perform  the  TLS  session
                resumption client processing.

              o ENFORCED  :  the server processes and accepts clients that are
                performing TLS session resumption. The server  rejects  client
                data  connections  that do not perform the TLS session resump-
                tion client processing. Before you set the value to ENFORCED ,
                test your clients.

              NOTE:
                 Not  all  FTPS clients perform TLS session resumption. So, if
                 you choose to enforce TLS session resumption, you prevent any
                 connections from FTPS clients that don't perform the protocol
                 negotiation. To determine whether or not you can use the  EN-
                 FORCED value, you need to test your clients.

          SetStatOption -> (string)
              Use the SetStatOption to ignore the error that is generated when
              the client attempts to use SETSTAT on a file you  are  uploading
              to an S3 bucket.

              Some  SFTP  file  transfer clients can attempt to change the at-
              tributes of remote files, including timestamp  and  permissions,
              using  commands,  such  as SETSTAT when uploading the file. How-
              ever, these commands are not compatible with object storage sys-
              tems,  such  as Amazon S3. Due to this incompatibility, file up-
              loads from these clients can result in errors even when the file
              is otherwise successfully uploaded.

              Set the value to ENABLE_NO_OP to have the Transfer Family server
              ignore the SETSTAT command, and upload files without needing  to
              make  any  changes  to your SFTP client. While the SetStatOption
              ENABLE_NO_OP setting ignores the error, it does generate  a  log
              entry  in  Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so you can determine when the
              client is making a SETSTAT call.

              NOTE:
                 If you want to preserve the original timestamp for your file,
                 and  modify other file attributes using SETSTAT , you can use
                 Amazon EFS as backend storage with Transfer Family.

          As2Transports -> (list)
              Indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages.  Currently,
              only HTTP is supported.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PassiveIp=string,TlsSessionResumptionMode=string,SetStatOption=string,As2Transports=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PassiveIp": "string",
            "TlsSessionResumptionMode": "DISABLED"|"ENABLED"|"ENFORCED",
            "SetStatOption": "DEFAULT"|"ENABLE_NO_OP",
            "As2Transports": ["HTTP", ...]
          }

       --endpoint-details (structure)
          The  virtual  private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are config-
          ured for your server. When you host your endpoint within  your  VPC,
          you  can make your endpoint accessible only to resources within your
          VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make  your  endpoint
          accessible to clients over the internet. Your VPC's default security
          groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.

          AddressAllocationIds -> (list)
              A list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach  an
              Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 and it is only valid in the UpdateServer API.

              (string)

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              A list of subnet IDs that are required to host your server  end-
              point in your VPC.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

              (string)

          VpcEndpointId -> (string)
              The identifier of the VPC endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when  EndpointType  is  set  to
                 VPC_ENDPOINT .

                 For             more             information,             see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The  VPC identifier of the VPC in which a server's endpoint will
              be hosted.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              A  list  of  security groups IDs that are available to attach to
              your server's endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

                 You   can   edit   the   SecurityGroupIds   property  in  the
                 UpdateServer API only if you are  changing  the  EndpointType
                 from  PUBLIC  or  VPC_ENDPOINT  to  VPC  . To change security
                 groups associated with your server's VPC endpoint after  cre-
                 ation, use the Amazon EC2 ModifyVpcEndpoint API.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AddressAllocationIds=string,string,SubnetIds=string,string,VpcEndpointId=string,VpcId=string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AddressAllocationIds": ["string", ...],
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "VpcEndpointId": "string",
            "VpcId": "string",
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --endpoint-type (string)
          The  type  of  endpoint  that  you  want your server to use. You can
          choose to make your server's endpoint publicly  accessible  (PUBLIC)
          or  host  it  inside  your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a
          VPC, you can restrict access  to  your  server  and  resources  only
          within  your  VPC  or choose to make it internet facing by attaching
          Elastic IP addresses directly to it.

          NOTE:
              After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a  server  using
              EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT  in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount if
              your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If  you
              have  already  created servers with EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in
              your Amazon Web Servicesaccount on or before May 19,  2021,  you
              will not be affected. After this date, use EndpointType =``VPC``
              .

              For              more              information,              see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

              It is recommended that you use VPC as the  EndpointType  .  With
              this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up
              to three Elastic IPv4 addresses  (BYO  IP  included)  with  your
              server's  endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traf-
              fic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with
              EndpointType set to VPC_ENDPOINT .

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC

          o VPC

          o VPC_ENDPOINT

       --host-key (string)
          The  RSA, ECDSA, or ED25519 private key to use for your SFTP-enabled
          server. You can add multiple host keys, in case you want  to  rotate
          keys, or have a set of active keys that use different algorithms.

          Use  the  following  command to generate an RSA 2048 bit key with no
          passphrase:
              ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key .

          Use a minimum value of 2048 for the -b  option.  You  can  create  a
          stronger key by using 3072 or 4096.

          Use  the  following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key with no
          passphrase:
              ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key .

          Valid values for the -b option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521.

          Use the following  command  to  generate  an  ED25519  key  with  no
          passphrase:
              ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key .

          For  all of these commands, you can replace my-new-server-key with a
          string of your choice.

          WARNING:
              If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an  exist-
              ing  SFTP-enabled  server to a new server, don't update the host
              key. Accidentally changing a server's host key  can  be  disrup-
              tive.

          For  more  information,  see  Manage host keys for your SFTP-enabled
          server in the Transfer Family User Guide .

       --identity-provider-details (structure)
          An array containing all of the information required to call  a  cus-
          tomer's authentication API method.

          Url -> (string)
              Provides  the location of the service endpoint used to authenti-
              cate users.

          InvocationRole -> (string)
              This parameter is only applicable if  your  IdentityProviderType
              is API_GATEWAY . Provides the type of InvocationRole used to au-
              thenticate the user account.

          DirectoryId -> (string)
              The identifier of the Directory Service directory that you  want
              to stop sharing.

          Function -> (string)
              The ARN for a Lambda function to use for the Identity provider.

          SftpAuthenticationMethods -> (string)
              For SFTP-enabled servers, and for custom identity providers only
              , you can specify whether to authenticate using a password,  SSH
              key pair, or both.

              o PASSWORD - users must provide their password to connect.

              o PUBLIC_KEY - users must provide their private key to connect.

              o PUBLIC_KEY_OR_PASSWORD  -  users  can authenticate with either
                their password or their key. This is the default value.

              o PUBLIC_KEY_AND_PASSWORD - users must provide both  their  pri-
                vate  key and their password to connect. The server checks the
                key first, and then if the key is valid,  the  system  prompts
                for a password. If the private key provided does not match the
                public key that is stored, authentication fails.

       --logging-role (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging
          for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFSevents. When set, you can view  user  ac-
          tivity in your CloudWatch logs.

       --post-authentication-login-banner (string)
          Specifies  a  string to display when users connect to a server. This
          string is displayed after the user authenticates.

          NOTE:
              The SFTP protocol does not support  post-authentication  display
              banners.

       --pre-authentication-login-banner (string)
          Specifies  a  string to display when users connect to a server. This
          string is displayed before the user authenticates. For example,  the
          following banner displays details about using the system:
              This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals
              using this computer system without authority, or  in  excess  of
              their  authority,  are subject to having all of their activities
              on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel.

       --protocols (list)
          Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols  over  which  your
          file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint.
          The available protocols are:

          o SFTP (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer  Protocol):  File  transfer
            over SSH

          o FTPS  (File  Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS en-
            cryption

          o FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer

          o AS2 (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting  structured
            business-to-business data

          NOTE:

              o If  you  select FTPS , you must choose a certificate stored in
                Certificate Manager (ACM)  which  is  used  to  identify  your
                server when clients connect to it over FTPS.

              o If  Protocol  includes either FTP or FTPS , then the Endpoint-
                Type must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must  be  either
                AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE , AWS_LAMBDA , or API_GATEWAY .

              o If Protocol includes FTP , then AddressAllocationIds cannot be
                associated.

              o If Protocol is set only to SFTP , the EndpointType can be  set
                to  PUBLIC  and the IdentityProviderType can be set any of the
                supported identity types: SERVICE_MANAGED , AWS_DIRECTORY_SER-
                VICE , AWS_LAMBDA , or API_GATEWAY .

              o If Protocol includes AS2 , then the EndpointType must be VPC ,
                and domain must be Amazon S3.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SFTP
            FTP
            FTPS
            AS2

       --security-policy-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the security policy that is  attached  to  the
          server.

       --server-id (string)
          A  system-assigned  unique identifier for a server instance that the
          Transfer Family user is assigned to.

       --workflow-details (structure)
          Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the  execu-
          tion role that's used for executing the workflow.

          In  addition  to  a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded com-
          pletely, WorkflowDetails can also contain a workflow ID (and  execu-
          tion  role)  for  a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial
          upload occurs when the server session disconnects while the file  is
          still being uploaded.

          To  remove  an associated workflow from a server, you can provide an
          empty OnUpload object, as in the following example.
              aws  transfer  update-server   --server-id   s-01234567890abcdef
              --workflow-details '{"OnUpload":[]}'

          OnUpload -> (list)
              A trigger that starts a workflow: the workflow begins to execute
              after a file is uploaded.

              To remove an associated workflow from a server, you can  provide
              an empty OnUpload object, as in the following example.
                 aws  transfer  update-server  --server-id s-01234567890abcdef
                 --workflow-details '{"OnUpload":[]}'

              (structure)
                 Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and  the
                 execution role that's used for executing the workflow.

                 In  addition to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded
                 completely, WorkflowDetails can also contain  a  workflow  ID
                 (and execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial up-
                 load. A partial upload occurs when the server session discon-
                 nects while the file is still being uploaded.

                 WorkflowId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the workflow.

                 ExecutionRole -> (string)
                     Includes  the  necessary  permissions  for  S3,  EFS, and
                     Lambda operations that Transfer can assume, so  that  all
                     workflow steps can operate on the required resources

          OnPartialUpload -> (list)
              A trigger that starts a workflow if a file is only partially up-
              loaded. You can attach a workflow  to  a  server  that  executes
              whenever there is a partial upload.

              A  partial  upload  occurs  when a file is open when the session
              disconnects.

              (structure)
                 Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and  the
                 execution role that's used for executing the workflow.

                 In  addition to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded
                 completely, WorkflowDetails can also contain  a  workflow  ID
                 (and execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial up-
                 load. A partial upload occurs when the server session discon-
                 nects while the file is still being uploaded.

                 WorkflowId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the workflow.

                 ExecutionRole -> (string)
                     Includes  the  necessary  permissions  for  S3,  EFS, and
                     Lambda operations that Transfer can assume, so  that  all
                     workflow steps can operate on the required resources

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OnUpload=[{WorkflowId=string,ExecutionRole=string},{WorkflowId=string,ExecutionRole=string}],OnPartialUpload=[{WorkflowId=string,ExecutionRole=string},{WorkflowId=string,ExecutionRole=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "OnUpload": [
              {
                "WorkflowId": "string",
                "ExecutionRole": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "OnPartialUpload": [
              {
                "WorkflowId": "string",
                "ExecutionRole": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --structured-log-destinations (list)
          Specifies the log groups to which your server logs are sent.

          To specify a log group, you must provide the ARN for an existing log
          group. In this case, the format of the log group is as follows:
              arn:aws:logs:region-name:amazon-ac-
              count-id:log-group:log-group-name:*

          For  example,  arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:mytest-
          group:*

          If you have previously specified a log group for a server,  you  can
          clear it, and in effect turn off structured logging, by providing an
          empty value for this parameter in an update-server call.  For  exam-
          ple:
              update-server     --server-id    s-1234567890abcdef0    --struc-
              tured-log-destinations

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --s3-storage-options (structure)
          Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3  directories
          is optimized. This is disabled by default.

          By  default,  home  directory mappings have a TYPE of DIRECTORY . If
          you enable this option, you would then need to  explicitly  set  the
          HomeDirectoryMapEntry   Type to FILE if you want a mapping to have a
          file target.

          DirectoryListingOptimization -> (string)
              Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3 directo-
              ries is optimized. This is disabled by default.

              By  default,  home directory mappings have a TYPE of DIRECTORY .
              If you enable this option, you would then need to explicitly set
              the HomeDirectoryMapEntry  Type to FILE if you want a mapping to
              have a file target.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DirectoryListingOptimization=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DirectoryListingOptimization": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
