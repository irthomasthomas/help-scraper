OPTIONS
       --association-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the RepositoryAssociation  object.
          You can retrieve this ARN by calling ListRepositoryAssociations .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disassociate a repository association

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) identifying the repository  asso-
              ciation.

          ConnectionArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  an  Amazon  Web Services
              CodeStar    Connections    connection.     Its     format     is

          Owner -> (string)
              The owner of the repository. For an Amazon Web Services CodeCom-
              mit repository, this is the Amazon Web Services  account  ID  of
              the  account  that owns the repository. For a GitHub, GitHub En-
              terprise Server, or Bitbucket repository, this is  the  username
              for  the account that owns the repository. For an S3 repository,
              it can be the username or Amazon Web Services account ID.

              The state of the repository association.

              The valid repository association states are:

              o Associated : The repository association is complete.

              o Associating : CodeGuru Reviewer is:

                o Setting up pull request notifications. This is required  for
                  pull requests to trigger a CodeGuru Reviewer review.

                NOTE:
                   If  your  repository ProviderType is GitHub , GitHub Enter-
                   prise Server , or Bitbucket  ,  CodeGuru  Reviewer  creates
                   webhooks  in  your  repository to trigger CodeGuru Reviewer
                   reviews. If you delete these webhooks, reviews of  code  in
                   your repository cannot be triggered.

                o Setting up source code access. This is required for CodeGuru
                  Reviewer to securely clone code in your repository.

              o Failed : The repository failed to associate or disassociate.

              o Disassociating : CodeGuru Reviewer  is  removing  the  reposi-
                tory's pull request notifications and source code access.

              o Disassociated  :  CodeGuru Reviewer successfully disassociated
                the repository. You can create a  new  association  with  this
                repository  if you want to review source code in it later. You
                can control access to code  reviews  created  in  anassociated
                repository with tags after it has been disassociated. For more
                information, see Using tags to control  access  to  associated
                repositories in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide .

          StateReason -> (string)

            Secret ). Tag keys are case sensitive.

          o An  optional field known as a tag value (for example, 111122223333
            , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same
            as  using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are case sen-
            sitive.
