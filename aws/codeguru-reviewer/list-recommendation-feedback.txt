OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If nextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results that are returned per call. The de-
          fault is 100.

       --code-review-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CodeReview object.

       --user-ids (list)
          An Amazon Web Services user's account ID  or  Amazon  Resource  Name
          (ARN).  Use  this ID to query the recommendation feedback for a code
          review from that user.

          The UserId is an IAM principal that can be specified  as  an  Amazon
          Web  Services  account ID or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more
          information, see Specifying a Principal in the Amazon  Web  Services
          Identity and Access Management User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --recommendation-ids (list)
          Used  to  query  the recommendation feedback for a given recommenda-
          tion.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
