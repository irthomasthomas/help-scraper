       list-repository-associations is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: RepositoryAssociationSummaries

OPTIONS
       --provider-types (list)
          List of provider types to use as a filter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CodeCommit
            GitHub
            Bitbucket
            GitHubEnterpriseServer
            S3Bucket

       --states (list)
          List of repository association states to use as a filter.

          The valid repository association states are:

          o Associated : The repository association is complete.

          o Associating : CodeGuru Reviewer is:

            o Setting up pull request notifications. This is required for pull
              requests to trigger a CodeGuru Reviewer review.

            NOTE:
                If your repository ProviderType is GitHub , GitHub  Enterprise
                Server  , or Bitbucket , CodeGuru Reviewer creates webhooks in
                your repository to trigger CodeGuru Reviewer reviews.  If  you
                delete these webhooks, reviews of code in your repository can-
                not be triggered.

            o Setting up source code access. This is required for CodeGuru Re-
              viewer to securely clone code in your repository.

          o Failed : The repository failed to associate or disassociate.

          o Disassociating  :  CodeGuru  Reviewer is removing the repository's
            pull request notifications and source code access.

          o Disassociated : CodeGuru Reviewer successfully  disassociated  the
            repository.  You can create a new association with this repository
            if you want to review source code in it later. You can control ac-
            cess to code reviews created in an associated repository with tags
            after it has been disassociated. For more information,  see  Using
            tags  to  control  access to associated repositories in the Amazon
            CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Associated
            Associating
            Failed
            Disassociating
            Disassociated

       --names (list)
          List of repository names to use as a filter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --owners (list)
          List of owners to use as a filter. For Amazon Web Services  CodeCom-
          mit, it is the name of the CodeCommit account that was used to asso-
          ciate the repository. For other repository source providers, such as
          Bitbucket  and GitHub Enterprise Server, this is name of the account
          that was used to associate the repository.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the repository associations in your AWS account

       The  following  list-repository-associations  example returns a list of
       repository association summary objects in your account. You can  filter
       the returned list by ProviderType, Name, State, and Owner.

                       terprise Server , or Bitbucket , CodeGuru Reviewer cre-
                       ates  webhooks  in  your repository to trigger CodeGuru
                       Reviewer reviews. If you delete these webhooks, reviews
                       of code in your repository cannot be triggered.

                   o Setting up source code access. This is required for Code-
                     Guru Reviewer to securely clone code in your repository.

                 o Failed : The repository failed to associate  or  disassoci-
                   ate.

                 o Disassociating  : CodeGuru Reviewer is removing the reposi-
                   tory's pull request notifications and source code access.

                 o Disassociated : CodeGuru Reviewer  successfully  disassoci-
                   ated  the repository. You can create a new association with
                   this repository if you want to review  source  code  in  it
