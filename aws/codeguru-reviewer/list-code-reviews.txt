OPTIONS
       --provider-types (list)
          List of provider types for filtering that needs to be applied before
          displaying  the  result.  For  example, providerTypes=[GitHub] lists
          code reviews from GitHub.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CodeCommit
            GitHub
            Bitbucket
            GitHubEnterpriseServer
            S3Bucket

       --states (list)
          List of states for filtering that needs to be  applied  before  dis-
          playing the result. For example, states=[Pending] lists code reviews
          in the Pending state.

          The valid code review states are:

          o Completed : The code review is complete.

          o Pending : The code review started and has not completed or failed.

          o Failed : The code review failed.

          o Deleting : The code review is being deleted.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Completed
            Pending
            Failed
            Deleting

       --repository-names (list)
          List of repository names for filtering that needs to be applied  be-
          fore displaying the result.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --type (string)
          The type of code reviews to list in the response.

          Possible values:

          o PullRequest

          o RepositoryAnalysis

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results that are returned per call. The de-
          fault is 100.

       --next-token (string)
          If nextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list code reviews created in your AWS account in the last 90 days.

       The  following list-code-reviews example lists the code reviews created
       in the last 90 days using pull requests.

          (structure)
              Information about the summary of the code review.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the code review.

              CodeReviewArn -> (string)

                 The owner of the repository. For an Amazon Web Services Code-
                 Commit repository, this is the Amazon Web Services account ID
                 of the account that owns the repository. For a GitHub, GitHub
                 Enterprise Server, or Bitbucket repository, this is the user-
                 name  for  the  account  that  owns the repository. For an S3
                 repository, it can be the username or Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count ID.

              ProviderType -> (string)
                 The provider type of the repository association.

              State -> (string)

                 The valid code review states are:

                 o Completed : The code review is complete.

                 o Pending  : The code review started and has not completed or
                   failed.

                 o Failed : The code review failed.

                 o Deleting : The code review is being deleted.

              CreatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the code  re-
                 view was created.

              LastUpdatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the code re-
                 view was last updated.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the code review.

              PullRequestId -> (string)
                 The pull request ID for the code review.

              MetricsSummary -> (structure)
                 The statistics from the code review.

                 MeteredLinesOfCodeCount -> (long)
                     Lines of code metered in the code review. For the initial
                     code  review  pull  request and all subsequent revisions,
                     this includes all lines of code in the files added to the
                     pull request. In subsequent revisions, for files that al-
                     ready existed in the pull request, this includes only the
                     changed  lines  of code. In both cases, this does not in-
                     clude non-code lines such as comments and  import  state-
                     ments. For example, if you submit a pull request contain-
                     ing 5 files, each with 500 lines of code, and in a subse-
                     quent  revision  you  added  a new file with 200 lines of
                     code, and also modified a total of 25  lines  across  the
                     initial  5  files,  MeteredLinesOfCodeCount  includes the
                     first 5 files (5 * 500 = 2,500 lines), the new file  (200
                     lines)  and  the  25 changed lines of code for a total of
                     2,725 lines of code.

                 SuppressedLinesOfCodeCount -> (long)
                     Lines of code suppressed in the code review based on  the
                     excludeFiles  element  in  the  aws-codeguru-reviewer.yml
                     file. For full repository analyses, this number  includes
                     all  lines  of code in the files that are suppressed. For
                     pull requests, this  number  only  includes  the  changed
                     lines  of  code  that are suppressed. In both cases, this
                     number does not include non-code lines such  as  comments
                     and  import  statements.  For  example, if you initiate a
                     full repository analysis on  a  repository  containing  5
                     files,  each file with 100 lines of code, and 2 files are
                     listed as excluded in the aws-codeguru-reviewer.yml file,
                     then  SuppressedLinesOfCodeCount returns 200 (2 * 100) as
                     the total number of lines of code suppressed. However, if
                     you  submit  a pull request for the same repository, then
                     SuppressedLinesOfCodeCount only includes the lines in the
                     2 files that changed. If only 1 of the 2 files changed in
                     the pull request, then SuppressedLinesOfCodeCount returns
                     100  (1  * 100) as the total number of lines of code sup-
                     pressed.
