INVOKE-ENDPOINT-ASYNC()                                INVOKE-ENDPOINT-ASYNC()



NAME
       invoke-endpoint-async -

DESCRIPTION
       After you deploy a model into production using Amazon SageMaker hosting
       services, your client applications use this API to get inferences  from
       the model hosted at the specified endpoint in an asynchronous manner.

       Inference  requests sent to this API are enqueued for asynchronous pro-
       cessing. The processing of the inference request may or  may  not  com-
       plete  before  you  receive a response from this API. The response from
       this API will not contain the result of the inference request but  con-
       tain information about where you can locate it.

       Amazon  SageMaker strips all POST headers except those supported by the
       API. Amazon SageMaker might add additional headers. You should not rely
       on the behavior of headers outside those enumerated in the request syn-
       tax.

       Calls to InvokeEndpointAsync are authenticated by using Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Signature Version 4. For information, see Authenticating Requests
       (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon S3  API  Refer-
       ence .

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  endpoint that you specified when you created the
          endpoint         using         the         `          CreateEndpoint
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html`__
          API.

       --content-type (string)
          The MIME type of the input data in the request body.

       --accept (string)
          The desired MIME type of the inference in the response.

       --custom-attributes (string)
          Provides additional information about a  request  for  an  inference
          submitted to a model hosted at an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. The in-
          formation is an opaque value that is forwarded verbatim.  You  could
          use  this  value,  for example, to provide an ID that you can use to
          track a request or to provide other metadata that a service endpoint
          was  programmed  to  process. The value must consist of no more than
          1024 visible US-ASCII characters  as  specified  in  Section  3.3.6.
          Field   Value   Components   of   the  Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol
          (HTTP/1.1).

          The code in your model is responsible for setting  or  updating  any
          custom  attributes  in  the response. If your code does not set this
          value in the response, an empty value is returned. For example, if a
          custom attribute represents the trace ID, your model can prepend the
          custom attribute with Trace ID : in your post-processing function.

          This feature is currently supported in the Amazon Web Services  SDKs
          but not in the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK.

       --inference-id (string)
          The identifier for the inference request. Amazon SageMaker will gen-
          erate an identifier for you if none is specified.

       --input-location (string)
          The Amazon S3 URI where the inference request payload is stored.

       --request-ttl-seconds (integer)
          Maximum age in seconds a request can be in the queue  before  it  is
          marked as expired.

       --invocation-timeout-seconds (integer)
          Maximum  amount of time in seconds a request can be processed before
          it is marked as expired.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       InferenceId -> (string)
          Identifier  for  an  inference request. This will be the same as the
          InferenceId specified in the input. Amazon SageMaker  will  generate
          an identifier for you if you do not specify one.

       OutputLocation -> (string)
          The Amazon S3 URI where the inference response payload is stored.
