INVOKE-ENDPOINT()                                            INVOKE-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       invoke-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       After you deploy a model into production using Amazon SageMaker hosting
       services, your client applications use this API to get inferences  from
       the model hosted at the specified endpoint.

       For an overview of Amazon SageMaker, see How It Works .

       Amazon  SageMaker strips all POST headers except those supported by the
       API. Amazon SageMaker might add additional headers. You should not rely
       on the behavior of headers outside those enumerated in the request syn-
       tax.

       Calls to InvokeEndpoint are authenticated by using Amazon Web  Services
       Signature Version 4. For information, see Authenticating Requests (Ama-
       zon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

       A customer's model containers must respond to requests within  60  sec-
       onds. The model itself can have a maximum processing time of 60 seconds
       before responding to invocations. If your model is going to take  50-60
       seconds  of processing time, the SDK socket timeout should be set to be
       70 seconds.

       NOTE:
          Endpoints are scoped to an individual account, and are  not  public.
          The URL does not contain the account ID, but Amazon SageMaker deter-
          mines the account ID from the authentication token that is  supplied
          by the caller.

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  endpoint that you specified when you created the
          endpoint using the CreateEndpoint API.

       --body (blob)
          Provides input data, in the format specified in the ContentType  re-
          quest header. Amazon SageMaker passes all of the data in the body to
          the model.

          For information about the format of the  request  body,  see  Common
          Data Formats-Inference .

       --content-type (string)
          The MIME type of the input data in the request body.

       --accept (string)
          The desired MIME type of the inference in the response.

       --custom-attributes (string)
          Provides  additional  information  about  a request for an inference
          submitted to a model hosted at an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. The in-
          formation  is  an opaque value that is forwarded verbatim. You could
          use this value, for example, to provide an ID that you  can  use  to
          track a request or to provide other metadata that a service endpoint
          was programmed to process. The value must consist of  no  more  than
          1024  visible  US-ASCII  characters  as  specified in Section 3.3.6.
          Field  Value  Components  of   the   Hypertext   Transfer   Protocol
          (HTTP/1.1).

          The  code  in  your model is responsible for setting or updating any
          custom attributes in the response. If your code does  not  set  this
          value in the response, an empty value is returned. For example, if a
          custom attribute represents the trace ID, your model can prepend the
          custom attribute with Trace ID: in your post-processing function.

          This  feature is currently supported in the Amazon Web Services SDKs
          but not in the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK.

       --target-model (string)
          The model to request for inference when invoking a multi-model  end-
          point.

       --target-variant (string)
          Specify the production variant to send the inference request to when
          invoking an endpoint that is running two or more variants. Note that
          this  parameter  overrides  the  default  behavior for the endpoint,
          which is to distribute the invocation traffic based on  the  variant
          weights.

          For  information  about  how to use variant targeting to perform a/b
          testing, see Test models in production

       --target-container-hostname (string)
          If the endpoint hosts multiple containers and is configured  to  use
          direct  invocation,  this  parameter  specifies the host name of the
          container to invoke.

       --inference-id (string)
          If you provide a value, it is added to the captured  data  when  you
          enable data capture on the endpoint. For information about data cap-
          ture, see Capture Data .

       --enable-explanations (string)
          An optional JMESPath expression used to override the  EnableExplana-
          tions   parameter   of   the  ClarifyExplainerConfig  API.  See  the
          EnableExplanations section in the developer guide for more  informa-
          tion.

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Body -> (blob)
          Includes the inference provided by the model.

          For  information  about  the format of the response body, see Common
          Data Formats-Inference .

          If the explainer is activated, the body  includes  the  explanations
          provided  by  the model. For more information, see the Response sec-
          tion under Invoke the Endpoint in the Developer Guide.

       ContentType -> (string)
          The MIME type of the inference returned in the response body.

       InvokedProductionVariant -> (string)
          Identifies the production variant that was invoked.

       CustomAttributes -> (string)
          Provides additional information in the response about the  inference
          returned  by a model hosted at an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. The in-
          formation is an opaque value that is forwarded verbatim.  You  could
          use this value, for example, to return an ID received in the Custom-
          Attributes header of a request or other metadata that a service end-
          point  was  programmed to produce. The value must consist of no more
          than 1024 visible US-ASCII characters as specified in Section 3.3.6.
          Field   Value   Components   of   the  Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol
          (HTTP/1.1). If the customer wants the custom attribute returned, the
          model must set the custom attribute to be included on the way back.

          The  code  in  your model is responsible for setting or updating any
          custom attributes in the response. If your code does  not  set  this
          value in the response, an empty value is returned. For example, if a
          custom attribute represents the trace ID, your model can prepend the
          custom attribute with Trace ID: in your post-processing function.

          This  feature is currently supported in the Amazon Web Services SDKs
          but not in the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK.
