OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --worlds (list)
          A list of Amazon Resource Names (arns) that correspond to worlds  to
          export.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --output-location (structure)

              The S3 bucket for output.

          s3Prefix -> (string)
              The S3 folder in the s3Bucket where output files will be placed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3Bucket=string,s3Prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3Bucket": "string",
            "s3Prefix": "string"
          }

       --iam-role (string)
          The IAM role that the world export process uses to access the Amazon
          S3 bucket and put the export.

       --tags (map)
          A map that contains tag keys and tag values that are attached to the
          world export job.

          key -> (string)

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
