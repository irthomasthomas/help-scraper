OPTIONS
       --job (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the simulation job to be de-
          scribed.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 The upload configurations for the robot application.

                 (structure)
                     Provides  upload configuration information. Files are up-
                     loaded from the simulation job to a location you specify.

                     name -> (string)
                        A prefix that specifies where files will  be  uploaded
                        in  Amazon S3. It is appended to the simulation output
                        location to determine the final path.

                        For example, if your  simulation  output  location  is
                        s3://my-bucket  and  your upload configuration name is
                        robot-test  ,  your  files   will   be   uploaded   to
                        s3://my-bucket/<simid>/<runid>/robot-test .

                     path -> (string)
                        Specifies  the path of the file(s) to upload. Standard
                        Unix glob matching rules are accepted, with the  addi-
                        tion of ** as a super asterisk . For example, specify-
                        ing /var/log/**.log  causes  all  .log  files  in  the
                        /var/log  directory tree to be collected. For more ex-
                        amples, see Glob Library .

                     uploadBehavior -> (string)

                            UPLOAD_ON_TERMINATE

                        Matching files are uploaded once the simulation enters
                        the TERMINATING state. Matching files are not uploaded
                        until all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

                        If there is a problem uploading a file, the upload  is
                        retried.  If  problems  persist, no further upload at-
                        tempts will be made.
                            UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                        Matching files are uploaded as they are created.  They
                        are  deleted  after  they  are uploaded. The specified
                        path is checked every 5 seconds. A final check is made
                        when all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

              useDefaultUploadConfigurations -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean indicating whether to use default upload configura-
                 tions. By default, .ros and .gazebo files are  uploaded  when
                 the  application  terminates  and  all  ROS  topics  will  be
                 recorded.

                 If you set this value, you must specify an outputLocation .

                 application.

                 (structure)
                     Provides upload configuration information. Files are  up-
                     loaded from the simulation job to a location you specify.

                     name -> (string)
                        A  prefix  that specifies where files will be uploaded
                        in Amazon S3. It is appended to the simulation  output
                        location to determine the final path.

                        For  example,  if  your  simulation output location is
                        s3://my-bucket and your upload configuration  name  is
                        robot-test   ,   your   files   will  be  uploaded  to
                        s3://my-bucket/<simid>/<runid>/robot-test .

                     path -> (string)
                        Specifies the path of the file(s) to upload.  Standard
                        Unix  glob matching rules are accepted, with the addi-
                        tion of ** as a super asterisk . For example, specify-
                        ing  /var/log/**.log  causes  all  .log  files  in the
                        /var/log directory tree to be collected. For more  ex-
                        amples, see Glob Library .

                            UPLOAD_ON_TERMINATE

                        Matching files are uploaded once the simulation enters
                        the TERMINATING state. Matching files are not uploaded
                        until all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

                        If  there is a problem uploading a file, the upload is
                        retried. If problems persist, no  further  upload  at-
                        tempts will be made.
                            UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                        Matching  files are uploaded as they are created. They
                        are deleted after they  are  uploaded.  The  specified
                        path is checked every 5 seconds. A final check is made
                        when all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

                 tions.  By  default, .ros and .gazebo files are uploaded when
                 the  application  terminates  and  all  ROS  topics  will  be
                 recorded.

                 If you set this value, you must specify an outputLocation .

                        quits  running.  RESTART  will  cause  your tool to be
                        restarted. FAIL will cause your job to exit.  The  de-
                        fault is RESTART .
