CREATE-SCHEMA-MAPPING()                                CREATE-SCHEMA-MAPPING()



NAME
       create-schema-mapping -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  schema  mapping, which defines the schema of the input cus-
       tomer records table. The SchemaMapping also provides Entity  Resolution
       with  some metadata about the table, such as the attribute types of the
       columns and which columns to match on.

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A description of the schema.

       --mapped-input-fields (list)
          A list of MappedInputFields . Each MappedInputField corresponds to a
          column  the  source  data table, and contains column name plus addi-
          tional information that Entity Resolution uses for matching.

          (structure)
              An object containing FieldName , Type , GroupName ,  MatchKey  ,
              and SubType .

              fieldName -> (string)
                 A string containing the field name.

              groupName -> (string)
                 A  string that instructs Entity Resolution to combine several
                 columns into a unified column with  the  identical  attribute
                 type.

                 For  example,  when working with columns such as first_name ,
                 middle_name , and last_name , assigning them a common  group-
                 Name will prompt Entity Resolution to concatenate them into a
                 single value.

              matchKey -> (string)
                 A key that allows grouping of multiple input attributes  into
                 a  unified  matching  group. For example, consider a scenario
                 where the source table contains various  addresses,  such  as
                 business_address   and  shipping_address  .  By  assigning  a
                 matchKey called address to both attributes, Entity Resolution
                 will  match  records across these fields to create a consoli-
                 dated matching group. If no matchKey is specified for a  col-
                 umn,  it  won't  be  utilized  for matching purposes but will
                 still be included in the output table.

              subType -> (string)
                 The subtype of the attribute, selected from a list of values.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the attribute, selected from a list of values.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          fieldName=string,groupName=string,matchKey=string,subType=string,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "fieldName": "string",
              "groupName": "string",
              "matchKey": "string",
              "subType": "string",
              "type": "NAME"|"NAME_FIRST"|"NAME_MIDDLE"|"NAME_LAST"|"ADDRESS"|"ADDRESS_STREET1"|"ADDRESS_STREET2"|"ADDRESS_STREET3"|"ADDRESS_CITY"|"ADDRESS_STATE"|"ADDRESS_COUNTRY"|"ADDRESS_POSTALCODE"|"PHONE"|"PHONE_NUMBER"|"PHONE_COUNTRYCODE"|"EMAIL_ADDRESS"|"UNIQUE_ID"|"DATE"|"STRING"|"PROVIDER_ID"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --schema-name (string)
          The name of the schema. There can't be multiple SchemaMappings  with
          the same name.

       --tags (map)
          The  tags  used  to  organize, track, or control access for this re-
          source.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
