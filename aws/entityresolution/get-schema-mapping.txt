OPTIONS
       --schema-name (string)
          The name of the schema to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       createdAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the SchemaMapping was created.

       description -> (string)
          A description of the schema.

       mappedInputFields -> (list)
          A list of MappedInputFields . Each MappedInputField corresponds to a
          column  the  source  data table, and contains column name plus addi-
          tional information Venice uses for matching.

          (structure)
              An object  containing  FieldField  ,  Type  ,  GroupName  ,  and
              MatchKey .

              fieldName -> (string)
                 A string containing the field name.

              groupName -> (string)
                 Instruct  Entity Resolution to combine several columns into a
                 unified column with the identical attribute type.  For  exam-
                 ple,  when  working  with  columns  such  as first_name, mid-
                 dle_name, and last_name, assigning them  a  common  GroupName
                 will prompt Entity Resolution to concatenate them into a sin-
                 gle value.

              matchKey -> (string)
                 A key that allows grouping of multiple input attributes  into
                 a  unified matching group. For example, let's consider a sce-
                 nario where the source table contains various addresses, such
                 as  business_address  and  shipping_address. By assigning the
                 MatchKey  Address ' to  both  attributes,  Entity  Resolution
                 will  match  records across these fields to create a consoli-
                 dated matching group. If no MatchKey is specified for a  col-
                 umn,  it  won't  be  utilized  for matching purposes but will
                 still be included in the output table.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the attribute, selected from a list of values.

       schemaArn -> (string)
          The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) that Entity Resolution generated  for
          the SchemaMapping.

       schemaName -> (string)
          The name of the schema.

       tags -> (map)
          The  tags  used  to  organize, track, or control access for this re-
          source.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       updatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the SchemaMapping was last updated.
