UPDATE-SCHEMA-MAPPING()                                UPDATE-SCHEMA-MAPPING()



NAME
       update-schema-mapping -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a schema mapping.

       NOTE:
          A  schema is immutable if it is being used by a workflow. Therefore,
          you can't update a schema mapping if it's associated  with  a  work-
          flow.

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A description of the schema.

       --mapped-input-fields (list)
          A list of MappedInputFields . Each MappedInputField corresponds to a
          column the source data table, and contains column  name  plus  addi-
          tional information that Entity Resolution uses for matching.

          (structure)
              An  object  containing FieldName , Type , GroupName , MatchKey ,
              Hashing , and SubType .

              fieldName -> (string)
                 A string containing the field name.

              groupName -> (string)
                 A string that instructs Entity Resolution to combine  several
                 columns  into  a  unified column with the identical attribute
                 type.

                 For example, when working with columns such as  first_name  ,
                 middle_name  , and last_name , assigning them a common group-
                 Name will prompt Entity Resolution to concatenate them into a
                 single value.

              hashed -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  if  the column values are hashed in the schema in-
                 put. If the value is set to TRUE  ,  the  column  values  are
                 hashed.  If the value is set to FALSE , the column values are
                 cleartext.

              matchKey -> (string)
                 A key that allows grouping of multiple input attributes  into
                 a unified matching group.

                 For  example, consider a scenario where the source table con-
                 tains various addresses, such as business_address  and  ship-
                 ping_address . By assigning a matchKey called address to both
                 attributes, Entity Resolution will match records across these
                 fields to create a consolidated matching group.

                 If  no  matchKey  is specified for a column, it won't be uti-
                 lized for matching purposes but will still be included in the
                 output table.

              subType -> (string)
                 The subtype of the attribute, selected from a list of values.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the attribute, selected from a list of values.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          fieldName=string,groupName=string,hashed=boolean,matchKey=string,subType=string,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "fieldName": "string",
              "groupName": "string",
              "hashed": true|false,
              "matchKey": "string",
              "subType": "string",
              "type": "NAME"|"NAME_FIRST"|"NAME_MIDDLE"|"NAME_LAST"|"ADDRESS"|"ADDRESS_STREET1"|"ADDRESS_STREET2"|"ADDRESS_STREET3"|"ADDRESS_CITY"|"ADDRESS_STATE"|"ADDRESS_COUNTRY"|"ADDRESS_POSTALCODE"|"PHONE"|"PHONE_NUMBER"|"PHONE_COUNTRYCODE"|"EMAIL_ADDRESS"|"UNIQUE_ID"|"DATE"|"STRING"|"PROVIDER_ID"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --schema-name (string)
          The  name of the schema. There can't be multiple SchemaMappings with
          the same name.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

       mappedInputFields -> (list)
          A list of MappedInputFields . Each MappedInputField corresponds to a
          column  the  source  data table, and contains column name plus addi-
          tional information that Entity Resolution uses for matching.

          (structure)
              An object containing FieldName , Type , GroupName ,  MatchKey  ,
              Hashing , and SubType .

                 A string containing the field name.

              groupName -> (string)

                 columns into a unified column with  the  identical  attribute
                 type.

                 For  example,  when working with columns such as first_name ,
                 middle_name , and last_name , assigning them a common  group-
                 Name will prompt Entity Resolution to concatenate them into a
                 single value.

              hashed -> (boolean)
                 Indicates if the column values are hashed in the  schema  in-

                 cleartext.

              matchKey -> (string)
                 A  key that allows grouping of multiple input attributes into
                 a unified matching group.

                 For example, consider a scenario where the source table  con-
                 tains  various  addresses, such as business_address and ship-
                 ping_address . By assigning a matchKey called address to both
                 attributes, Entity Resolution will match records across these
                 fields to create a consolidated matching group.

                 If no matchKey is specified for a column, it  won't  be  uti-
                 lized for matching purposes but will still be included in the
                 output table.

              subType -> (string)
