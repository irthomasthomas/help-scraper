CREATE-ID-MAPPING-WORKFLOW()                      CREATE-ID-MAPPING-WORKFLOW()



NAME
       create-id-mapping-workflow -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  IdMappingWorkflow object which stores the configuration of
       the data processing job to be run. Each IdMappingWorkflow must  have  a
       unique  workflow name. To modify an existing workflow, use the UpdateI-
       dMappingWorkflow API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       create-id-mapping-workflow uses document type  values.  Document  types
       follow  the  JSON  data model where valid values are: strings, numbers,
       booleans, null, arrays, and objects. For  command  input,  options  and
       nested  parameters that are labeled with the type document must be pro-
       vided as JSON. Shorthand syntax does not support document types.
