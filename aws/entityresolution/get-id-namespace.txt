GET-ID-NAMESPACE()                                          GET-ID-NAMESPACE()



NAME
       get-id-namespace -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the IdNamespace with a given name, if it exists.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-id-namespace  uses  document type values. Document types follow the
       JSON data model where valid values  are:  strings,  numbers,  booleans,
       null, arrays, and objects. For command input, options and nested param-
       eters that are labeled with the type document must be provided as JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

SYNOPSIS

OPTIONS
       --id-namespace-name (string)
          The name of the ID namespace.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       createdAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the ID namespace was created.

       description -> (string)
          The description of the ID namespace.

       idMappingWorkflowProperties -> (list)
          Determines  the  properties of IdMappingWorkflow where this IdNames-
          pace can be used as a Source or a Target .

          (structure)
              An object containing IdMappingType ,  ProviderProperties  ,  and
              RuleBasedProperties .

              idMappingType -> (string)
                 The type of ID mapping.

              providerProperties -> (structure)
                 An  object  which  defines  any additional configurations re-
                 quired by the provider service.

                 providerConfiguration -> (document)
                     An object which defines any additional configurations re-
                     quired by the provider service.

                 providerServiceArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the provider service.

              ruleBasedProperties -> (structure)
                 An  object  which  defines  any additional configurations re-
                 quired by rule-based matching.

                 attributeMatchingModel -> (string)
                     The comparison type. You can either choose ONE_TO_ONE  or
                     MANY_TO_MANY as the attributeMatchingModel .

                     If  you  choose  MANY_TO_MANY  , the system can match at-
                     tributes across the sub-types of an attribute  type.  For
                     example,  if  the  value  of the Email field of Profile A
                     matches the value of BusinessEmail field  of  Profile  B,
                     the two profiles are matched on the Email attribute type.

                     If  you choose ONE_TO_ONE , the system can only match at-
                     tributes if the sub-types are an exact match.  For  exam-
                     ple,  for  the Email attribute type, the system will only
                     consider it a match if the value of the  Email  field  of
                     Profile A matches the value of the Email field of Profile
                     B.

                 recordMatchingModels -> (list)
                     The type of matching record that is allowed to be used in
                     an ID mapping workflow.

                     If  the  value  is set to ONE_SOURCE_TO_ONE_TARGET , only
                     one record in the source is matched to one record in  the
                     target.

                     If  the  value  is set to MANY_SOURCE_TO_ONE_TARGET , all
                     matching records in the source are matched to one  record
                     in the target.

                     (string)

                 ruleDefinitionTypes -> (list)
                     The  sets of rules you can use in an ID mapping workflow.
                     The limitations specified for the source and target  must
                     be compatible.

                     (string)

                 rules -> (list)
                     The rules for the ID namespace.

                     (structure)
                        An object containing RuleName , and MatchingKeys .

                        matchingKeys -> (list)
                            A  list  of  MatchingKeys  . The MatchingKeys must
                            have been  defined  in  the  SchemaMapping  .  Two
                            records  are considered to match according to this
                            rule if all of the MatchingKeys match.

                            (string)

                 flow ARN for the input source table.

                 The name of the schema.

       roleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  role.  Entity  Resolution
          assumes  this  role to access the resources defined in this IdNames-
          pace on your behalf as part of a workflow run.

       tags -> (map)

          The TARGET contains a configuration of targetId to which  all  sour-
          ceIds will resolve to.
