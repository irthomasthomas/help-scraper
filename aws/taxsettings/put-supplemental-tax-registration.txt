OPTIONS
       --tax-registration-entry (structure)
          The  supplemental TRN information that will be stored for the caller
          account ID.

          address -> (structure)
              The details of the address associated with the TRN information.

              addressLine1 -> (string)
                 The first line of the address.

              addressLine2 -> (string)

              addressLine3 -> (string)
                 The third line of the address, if applicable. Currently,  the
                 Tax  Settings API accepts the addressLine3 parameter only for
                 Saudi Arabia. When you specify a TRN  in  Saudi  Arabia,  you
                 must  enter  the addressLine3 and specify the building number
                 for the address. For example, you might enter 1234 .

              city -> (string)
                 The city that the address is in.

              countryCode -> (string)

              districtOrCounty -> (string)
                 The district or county the address is located.

                 NOTE:
                     For addresses in Brazil, this parameter uses the name  of
                     the  neighborhood. When you set a TRN in Brazil, use dis-
                     trictOrCounty for the neighborhood name.

              postalCode -> (string)
                 The postal code associated with the address.

              stateOrRegion -> (string)
                 The state, region, or province that the address  is  located.

                 Emirates, Romania, and Brazil (CPF). It is optional  for  all
                 other countries.

                 If  this  is  required for tax settings, use the same name as

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
