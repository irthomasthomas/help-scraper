          vertexFilter -> (map)
              Used  to specify filters on a per-label basis for vertices. This
              allows you to control which vertex labels and properties are in-
              cluded in the export.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Specifies  whihc  properties of that label should be included
                 in the export.

                 properties -> (map)
                     Each property is defined by a key-value pair,  where  the
                     key  is  the  desired output property name (e.g. "name"),
                     and the value is an object.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        A structure representing a property's  attributes.  It
                        is  a map object of outputType, sourcePropertyName and
                        multiValueHandling.

                        outputType -> (string)
                            Specifies the data type to use for the property in
                            the exported data (e.g. "String", "Int", "Float").
                            If a type is not provided, the export process will
                            determine the type. If a given property is present
                            as multiple types (e.g. one  vertex  has  "height"
                            stored as a double, and another edge has it stored
                            as a string), the type will be of Any type, other-
                            wise,  it  will  be  the  type  of the property as
                            present in vertices.

                        sourcePropertyName -> (string)

                            inal  graph  data.  If not provided, it is assumed
                            that the key matches the  desired  sourceProperty-
                            Name.

                        multiValueHandling -> (string)
                            Specifies  how to handle properties that have mul-
                            tiple values. Can be either TO_LIST to export  all
                            values  as  a  list,  or  PICK_FIRST to export the
                            first value encountered. If not specified, the de-
                            fault value is PICK_FIRST .

          edgeFilter -> (map)
              Used to specify filters on a per-label basis for edges. This al-
              lows you to control which edge labels  and  properties  are  in-
              cluded in the export.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Specifies  whihc  properties of that label should be included

                 properties -> (map)
                     Each property is defined by a key-value pair,  where  the
                     key  is  the  desired output property name (e.g. "name"),
                     and the value is an object.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        A structure representing a property's  attributes.  It
                        is  a map object of outputType, sourcePropertyName and
                        multiValueHandling.

                        outputType -> (string)
                            Specifies the data type to use for the property in
                            the exported data (e.g. "String", "Int", "Float").
                            If a type is not provided, the export process will
                            determine the type. If a given property is present

                            as a string), the type will be of Any type, other-
                            wise,  it  will  be  the  type  of the property as

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
