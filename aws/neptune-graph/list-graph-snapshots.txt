LIST-GRAPH-SNAPSHOTS()                                  LIST-GRAPH-SNAPSHOTS()



NAME
       list-graph-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists available snapshots of a specified Neptune Analytics graph.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-graph-snapshots  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: graphSnapshots

OPTIONS
       --graph-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the Neptune Analytics graph.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       graphSnapshots -> (list)
          The requested list of snapshots.

          (structure)
              Details about a graph snapshot.

              id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the graph snapshot.

              name -> (string)
                 The snapshot name. For example: my-snapshot-1 .

                 The name must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers,  or  hy-
                 phens,  and  its  first character must be a letter. It cannot
                 end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the graph snapshot.

              sourceGraphId -> (string)
                 The graph identifier for the graph for which a snapshot is to
                 be created.

              snapshotCreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the snapshot was created.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the graph snapshot.

              kmsKeyIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the KMS key used to encrypt and decrypt the snap-
                 shot.

       nextToken -> (string)
          Pagination token used to paginate output.

          When this value is provided as input, the  service  returns  results
          from  where  the  previous  response  left  off.  When this value is
          present in output, it indicates that there are more results  to  re-
          trieve.
