OPTIONS
       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The ID of the snapshot in question.

       --graph-name (string)
          A  name  for  the new Neptune Analytics graph to be created from the
          snapshot.

          The name must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens, and
          its first character must be a letter. It cannot end with a hyphen or
          contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --provisioned-memory (integer)
          The provisioned memory-optimized Neptune Capacity Units (m-NCUs)  to
          use for the graph. Min = 128

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the graph has deletion protection en-
          abled. The graph can't be deleted when deletion  protection  is  en-
          abled.

       --tags (map)
          Adds metadata tags to the snapshot. These tags can also be used with
          cost allocation reporting, or used in a Condition  statement  in  an
          IAM policy.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --replica-count (integer)
          The number of replicas in other AZs. Min =0, Max = 2, Default =1

       --public-connectivity | --no-public-connectivity (boolean)
          Specifies  whether or not the graph can be reachable over the inter-
          net. All access to graphs is IAM authenticated. (true to enable,  or
          false to disable).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the graph.

       name -> (string)
          The name of the graph.

          the graph. Max = 65535

          The ID of the snapshot from which the graph was created, if any.

       deletionProtection -> (boolean)
          If true , deletion protection is enabled for the graph.
