OPTIONS
       --graph-name (string)
          A name for the new Neptune Analytics graph to be created.

          The name must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens, and
          its first character must be a letter. It cannot end with a hyphen or
          contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --tags (map)
          Adds  metadata  tags  to  the new graph. These tags can also be used
          with cost allocation reporting, or used in a Condition statement  in
          an IAM policy.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --public-connectivity | --no-public-connectivity (boolean)
          Specifies  whether or not the graph can be reachable over the inter-
          net. All access to graphs is IAM authenticated. (true to enable,  or
          false to disable.

       --kms-key-identifier (string)
          Specifies a KMS key to use to encrypt data in the new graph.

       --vector-search-configuration (structure)
          Specifies  the  number of dimensions for vector embeddings that will
          be loaded into the graph.  The  value  is  specified  as  dimension=
          value. Max = 65,535

          dimension -> (integer)
              The number of dimensions.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          dimension=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "dimension": integer
          }

       --replica-count (integer)
          The number of replicas in other AZs. Min =0, Max = 2, Default = 1.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Indicates whether or not to enable deletion protection on the graph.
          The graph cant be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. (true
          or false ).

       --provisioned-memory (integer)
          The  provisioned memory-optimized Neptune Capacity Units (m-NCUs) to
          use for the graph. Min = 128

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
