DESCRIPTION
       Import  data  into  existing Neptune Analytics graph from Amazon Simple
       Storage Service (S3). The graph needs to be empty and in the  AVAILABLE
       state.

OPTIONS
       --import-options (tagged union structure)
          Options for how to perform an import.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: neptune.

          neptune -> (structure)
              Options for importing data from a Neptune database.

              s3ExportPath -> (string)
                 The path to an S3 bucket from which to import data.

              s3ExportKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The KMS key to use to encrypt data in the S3 bucket where the
                 graph data is exported

              preserveDefaultVertexLabels -> (boolean)
                 Neptune  Analytics supports label-less vertices and no labels
                 are assigned unless one is explicitly provided.  Neptune  as-
                 signs  default  labels when none is explicitly provided. When
                 importing the data into Neptune Analytics, the default vertex
                 labels  can be omitted by setting preserveDefaultVertexLabels
                 to false. Note that if the vertex only  has  default  labels,
                 and  has  no  other properties or edges, then the vertex will
                 effectively not get imported into Neptune Analytics when pre-
                 serveDefaultVertexLabels is set to false.

              preserveEdgeIds -> (boolean)
                 Neptune  Analytics  currently  does  not support user defined
                 edge ids. The edge ids are not imported by default. They  are
                 imported  if  preserveEdgeIds  is  set  to  true, and ids are
                 stored as properties on the relationships with  the  property
                 name neptuneEdgeId .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          neptune={s3ExportPath=string,s3ExportKmsKeyId=string,preserveDefaultVertexLabels=boolean,preserveEdgeIds=boolean}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "neptune": {
              "s3ExportPath": "string",
              "s3ExportKmsKeyId": "string",
              "preserveDefaultVertexLabels": true|false,
              "preserveEdgeIds": true|false
            }
          }

       --fail-on-error | --no-fail-on-error (boolean)
          If  set to true, the task halts when an import error is encountered.
          If set to false, the task skips the data that caused the  error  and
          continues if possible.

       --source (string)
          A  URL identifying the location of the data to be imported. This can
          be an Amazon S3 path, or can point to a Neptune database endpoint or
          snapshot.

       --format (string)
          Specifies  the format of Amazon S3 data to be imported. Valid values
          are CSV, which identifies the  Gremlin  CSV  format  or  OPENCYPHER,
          which identies the openCypher load format.

          Possible values:

          o CSV

          o OPEN_CYPHER

       --graph-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the Neptune Analytics graph.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the IAM role that will allow access to the data that is
          to be imported.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
