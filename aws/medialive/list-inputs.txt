LIST-INPUTS()                                                    LIST-INPUTS()



NAME
       list-inputs -

DESCRIPTION
       Produces list of inputs that have been created

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-inputs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Inputs

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                 rently an input can only be attached to one channel).

                        The system-generated static IP address of endpoint. It
                        remains fixed for the lifetime of the input.

                     Port -> (string)
                        The port number for the input.

                     Url -> (string)
                        This represents the endpoint that the customer  stream
                        will be pushed to.

                     Vpc -> (structure)
                        The properties for a VPC type input destination.

                        AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                            The availability zone of the Input destination.

                        NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                            The  network interface ID of the Input destination
                            in the VPC.

                 The generated ID of the input (unique for user  account,  im-
                 mutable).

              InputClass -> (string)
                 STANDARD  -  MediaLive expects two sources to be connected to
                 this input. If the channel is  also  STANDARD,  both  sources
                 will be ingested. If the channel is SINGLE_PIPELINE, only the
                 first source will be ingested; the second source will  always
                 be ignored, even if the first source fails. SINGLE_PIPELINE -
                 You can connect only one source to this input. If  the  Chan-
                 nelClass is also SINGLE_PIPELINE, this value is valid. If the
                 ChannelClass is STANDARD, this value is not valid because the
                 channel requires two sources in the input.

                 Certain  pull input sources can be dynamic, meaning that they
                 can have their URL's dynamically changes during input  switch
                 actions.   Presently,  this  functionality  only  works  with

                        The configuration for a source that uses  SRT  as  the
                        connection protocol. In terms of establishing the con-
                        nection, MediaLive is always caller and  the  upstream
                        system  is  always the listener. In terms of transmis-
                        sion of the source content, MediaLive  is  always  the
                        receiver and the upstream system is always the sender.

                        Decryption -> (structure)
                            The decryption settings for the SRT caller source.
                            Present only if the source has decryption enabled.

                            Algorithm -> (string)
                               The algorithm used to encrypt content.

                            PassphraseSecretArn -> (string)
                               The ARN for  the  secret  in  Secrets  Manager.
                               Someone  in your organization must create a se-
                               cret and provide you with its ARN.  The  secret
                               holds the passphrase that MediaLive uses to de-
                               crypt the source content.

                        MinimumLatency -> (integer)
                            The preferred latency (in milliseconds) for imple-
                            menting  packet loss and recovery. Packet recovery
                            is a key feature of SRT.

                        SrtListenerAddress -> (string)
                            The IP address at the upstream  system  (the  lis-
                            tener) that MediaLive (the caller) connects to.

                        SrtListenerPort -> (string)
                            The  port  at  the  upstream system (the listener)
                            that MediaLive (the caller) connects to.

                        StreamId -> (string)
                            The stream ID, if the upstream  system  uses  this
                            identifier.
