NAME
       create-channel-placement-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Create a ChannelPlacementGroup in the specified Cluster. As part of the
       create operation, you specify the Nodes to attach  the  group  to.After
       you  create a ChannelPlacementGroup, you add Channels to the group (you
       do this by modifying the Channels to add them to a specific group). You
       now have an association of Channels to ChannelPlacementGroup, and Chan-
       nelPlacementGroup to Nodes. This association means that all  the  Chan-
       nels  in  the group are able to run on any of the Nodes associated with
       the group.

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string) The ID of the cluster.

       --name (string) Specify a name that is unique in the Cluster. You can't
       change the name. Names are case-sensitive.

       --nodes  (list)  An array of one ID for the Node that you want to asso-
       ciate with the ChannelPlacementGroup. (You can't  associate  more  than
       one  Node  with  the  ChannelPlacementGroup.)  The  Node  and the Chan-
       nelPlacementGroup must be in the same Cluster.(string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --request-id (string) An ID that you assign to a create  request.  This
       ID ensures idempotency when creating resources. the request.

       --tags (map) A collection of key-value pairs.key -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of this ChannelPlacementGroup. It is automatically  assigned
          when the ChannelPlacementGroup is created.

       Channels -> (list)
          Used in ListChannelPlacementGroupsResult
