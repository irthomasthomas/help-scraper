LIST-CLUSTERS()                                                LIST-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       list-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve the list of Clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-clusters  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Clusters

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Clusters -> (list)
          A list of the Clusters that exist in your AWS account.

          (structure)
              Used in ListClustersResult.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  this Cluster. It is automatically assigned when
                 the Cluster is created.

              ChannelIds -> (list)
                 An array of the IDs of the Channels that are associated  with
                 this  Cluster.  One Channel is associated with the Cluster as
                 follows: A Channel  belongs  to  a  ChannelPlacementGroup.  A
                 ChannelPlacementGroup  is  attached to a Node. A Node belongs
                 to a Cluster.

                 (string)
                     Placeholder documentation for __string

              ClusterType -> (string)
                 The hardware type for the Cluster.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the Cluster. Unique in the AWS account. The  ID  is
                 the resource-id portion of the ARN.

              InstanceRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the  IAM role for the Node in this Cluster. Any
                 Nodes that are associated with this Cluster assume this role.
                 The  role gives permissions to the operations that you expect
                 these Node to perform.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name that you specified for the Cluster.

              NetworkSettings -> (structure)
                 Network settings that connect the Nodes in the Cluster to one
                 or more of the Networks that the Cluster is associated with.

                 DefaultRoute -> (string)
                     The network interface that is the default route for traf-
                     fic to and from the node. MediaLive  Anywhere  uses  this
                     default  when  the destination for the traffic isn't cov-
                     ered by the route table for any of the networks.  Specify
                     the value of the appropriate logicalInterfaceName parame-
                     ter that you create in the interfaceMappings.

                 InterfaceMappings -> (list)
                     An array of interfaceMapping objects  for  this  Cluster.
                     Each  mapping  logically  connects  one  interface on the
                     nodes with one Network. You need  only  one  mapping  for
                     each interface because all the Nodes share the mapping.

                     (structure)
                        Used in ClusterNetworkSettings

                        LogicalInterfaceName -> (string)
                            The logical name for one interface (on every Node)
                            that handles a specific type of traffic. We recom-
                            mend that the name hints at the physical interface
                            it applies to. For example, it could refer to  the
                            traffic  that  the physical interface handles. For
                            example, my-Inputs-Interface.

                        NetworkId -> (string)
                            The ID of the network that you want to connect  to
                            the specified logicalInterfaceName.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the Cluster.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Token for the next result.
