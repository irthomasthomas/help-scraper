          Placeholder documentation for __listOfSrtCallerSourceRequest

          (structure)
              Configures the connection for a source that uses SRT as the con-
              nection protocol. In terms of establishing the connection, Medi-
              aLive is always the caller and the upstream system is always the
              listener. In terms of transmission of the source content,  Medi-
              aLive  is  always the receiver and the upstream system is always
              the sender.

              Decryption -> (structure)
                 Complete these parameters only if the content is encrypted.

                 Algorithm -> (string)
                     The algorithm used to encrypt content.

                 PassphraseSecretArn -> (string)
                     The ARN for the secret in  Secrets  Manager.  Someone  in
                     your  organization  must  create a secret and provide you
                     with its ARN. This secret holds the passphrase that Medi-
                     aLive will use to decrypt the source content.

              MinimumLatency -> (integer)
                 The  preferred  latency  (in  milliseconds)  for implementing
                 packet loss and recovery. Packet recovery is a key feature of
                 SRT. Obtain this value from the operator at the upstream sys-
                 tem.

              SrtListenerAddress -> (string)
                 The IP address at the upstream system (the listener) that Me-
                 diaLive (the caller) will connect to.

              SrtListenerPort -> (string)
                 The port at the upstream system (the listener) that MediaLive
                 (the caller) will connect to.

              StreamId -> (string)
                 This value is required if the upstream system uses this iden-
                 tifier  because  without  it, the SRT handshake between Medi-
                 aLive (the caller) and the  upstream  system  (the  listener)
                 might fail.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SrtCallerSources": [
              {
                "Decryption": {
                  "Algorithm": "AES128"|"AES192"|"AES256",
                  "PassphraseSecretArn": "string"
                },

              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an input

       The following create-input example creates an HLS PULL input by passing
       in a JSON file that contains the parameters that apply to this type  of
       input.  The  JSON  for  this  example  input specifies two sources (ad-
       dresses) to the input, in order to support redundancy  in  the  ingest.
       These addresses require passwords.

         with a PUSH input.

       o Id for the input, the same as the ID in the ARN.

       o MediaConnectFlows,  which is empty in this example because it is used
         only with an input of type MediaConnect.

       o SecurityGroups, which is empty in this example  because  it  is  used
         only with a PUSH input.

       o State of this input.

       o Tags, which is empty (the default for this parameter).

                     remains fixed for the lifetime of the input.

                 Port -> (string)
                     The port number for the input.

                 Url -> (string)

          InputClass -> (string)
              STANDARD - MediaLive expects two sources to be connected to this
              input. If the channel is also STANDARD, both sources will be in-
              gested. If the channel is SINGLE_PIPELINE, only the first source
              will be ingested; the second source will always be ignored, even
              if  the  first  source  fails. SINGLE_PIPELINE - You can connect
              only one source to this input. If the ChannelClass is also  SIN-
              GLE_PIPELINE,  this value is valid. If the ChannelClass is STAN-
              DARD, this value is not valid because the channel  requires  two
              sources in the input.

                     store.

                 Url -> (string)
                     This represents the customer's source URL where stream is
                     pulled from.

                 Username -> (string)
                     The username for the input source.

          State -> (string)
              Placeholder documentation for InputState

          Tags -> (map)
              A collection of key-value pairs.

              key -> (string)
                 Placeholder documentation for __string

              value -> (string)
                 Placeholder documentation for __string

          Type -> (string)
              The  different types of inputs that AWS Elemental MediaLive sup-
              ports.

          SrtSettings -> (structure)
              The settings associated with an SRT input.

              SrtCallerSources -> (list)
                 Placeholder documentation for __listOfSrtCallerSource

                 (structure)
                     The configuration for a source that uses SRT as the  con-
                     nection  protocol.  In  terms of establishing the connec-
                     tion, MediaLive is always caller and the upstream  system
                     is  always  the listener. In terms of transmission of the
                     source content, MediaLive is always the receiver and  the
                     upstream system is always the sender.

                     Decryption -> (structure)
                        The  decryption  settings  for  the SRT caller source.
                        Present only if the source has decryption enabled.

                        Algorithm -> (string)
                            The algorithm used to encrypt content.

                        PassphraseSecretArn -> (string)
                            The ARN for the secret in Secrets Manager. Someone
                            in your organization must create a secret and pro-
                            vide you  with  its  ARN.  The  secret  holds  the
                            passphrase  that  MediaLive  uses  to  decrypt the
                            source content.

                     MinimumLatency -> (integer)
                        The preferred latency (in milliseconds) for implement-
                        ing packet loss and recovery. Packet recovery is a key
                        feature of SRT.

                     SrtListenerAddress -> (string)
                        The IP address at the upstream system  (the  listener)
                        that MediaLive (the caller) connects to.

                     SrtListenerPort -> (string)
                        The  port  at  the upstream system (the listener) that
                        MediaLive (the caller) connects to.

                     StreamId -> (string)
                        The stream ID, if the upstream system uses this  iden-
                        tifier.
