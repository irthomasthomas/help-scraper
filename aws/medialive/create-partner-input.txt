OPTIONS
       --input-id (string) Unique ID of the input.

       --request-id  (string)  Unique  identifier of the request to ensure the
       request is handled exactly once in case of retries.

       --tags (map) A collection of key-value pairs.key -> (string)
              Placeholder documentation for __string

          value -> (string)
              Placeholder documentation for __string

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

                 Ip -> (string)
                     The system-generated static IP address  of  endpoint.  It
                     remains fixed for the lifetime of the input.

                 Port -> (string)
                     The port number for the input.

                 Url -> (string)

                     will be pushed to.

                 Vpc -> (structure)
                     The properties for a VPC type input destination.

                     AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                        The availability zone of the Input destination.

                     NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                        The network interface ID of the Input  destination  in

          Id -> (string)
              The  generated  ID  of  the  input (unique for user account, im-
              mutable).

          InputClass -> (string)
              STANDARD - MediaLive expects two sources to be connected to this
              input. If the channel is also STANDARD, both sources will be in-
              gested. If the channel is SINGLE_PIPELINE, only the first source
              will be ingested; the second source will always be ignored, even
              if the first source fails. SINGLE_PIPELINE  -  You  can  connect
              only  one source to this input. If the ChannelClass is also SIN-
              GLE_PIPELINE, this value is valid. If the ChannelClass is  STAN-
              DARD,  this  value is not valid because the channel requires two
              sources in the input.

                     nection protocol. In terms of  establishing  the  connec-
                     tion,  MediaLive is always caller and the upstream system
                     is always the listener. In terms of transmission  of  the
                     source  content, MediaLive is always the receiver and the
                     upstream system is always the sender.

                            The algorithm used to encrypt content.

                        PassphraseSecretArn -> (string)
                            The ARN for the secret in Secrets Manager. Someone
                            in your organization must create a secret and pro-
                            vide  you  with  its  ARN.  The  secret  holds the
                            passphrase that  MediaLive  uses  to  decrypt  the
                            source content.

                     MinimumLatency -> (integer)
                        The preferred latency (in milliseconds) for implement-
                        ing packet loss and recovery. Packet recovery is a key
                        feature of SRT.

                     SrtListenerAddress -> (string)
                        The  IP  address at the upstream system (the listener)
                        that MediaLive (the caller) connects to.

                     SrtListenerPort -> (string)
                        The port at the upstream system  (the  listener)  that
                        MediaLive (the caller) connects to.

                     StreamId -> (string)
                        The  stream ID, if the upstream system uses this iden-
                        tifier.
