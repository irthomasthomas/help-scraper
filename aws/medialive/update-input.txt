       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

                     The port number for the input.

              GLE_PIPELINE, this value is valid. If the ChannelClass is  STAN-
              DARD,  this  value is not valid because the channel requires two
              sources in the input.
