OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string) The ID of the cluster

       --node-id (string) The ID of the node.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of the Node. It is automatically assigned when the Node is
          created.

       ChannelPlacementGroups -> (list)
          An array of IDs. Each ID is one ChannelPlacementGroup that is  asso-
          ciated  with this Node. Empty if the Node is not yet associated with
          any groups.

          (string)
              Placeholder documentation for __string

       ClusterId -> (string)
          The ID of the Cluster that the Node belongs to.

       ConnectionState -> (string)
          The current connection state of the Node.

       Id -> (string)
          The unique ID of the Node. Unique in the Cluster. The ID is the  re-
          source-id portion of the ARN.

       InstanceArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the EC2 instance hosting the Node.

       Name -> (string)
          The name that you specified for the Node.

       NodeInterfaceMappings -> (list)
          Documentation update needed

          (structure)
              A  mapping  that's used to pair a logical network interface name
              on a Node with the physical interface name exposed in the  oper-
              ating system.

              LogicalInterfaceName -> (string)
                 A  uniform  logical  interface name to address in a MediaLive
                 channel configuration.

              NetworkInterfaceMode -> (string)
                 Used  in  NodeInterfaceMapping  and  NodeInterfaceMappingCre-
                 ateRequest

              PhysicalInterfaceName -> (string)
                 The  name of the physical interface on the hardware that will
                 be running Elemental anywhere.

       Role -> (string)
          The initial role current role of the Node  in  the  Cluster.  ACTIVE
          means the Node is available for encoding. BACKUP means the Node is a
          redundant Node and might get used if an ACTIVE Node fails.

       State -> (string)
          The current state of the Node.
