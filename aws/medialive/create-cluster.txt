OPTIONS
       --cluster-type  (string)  Specify  a type. All the Nodes that you later
       add to this Cluster must be this type of hardware. One Cluster instance
       can't  contain  different  hardware  types. You won't be able to change
       this parameter after you create the Cluster.
          Possible values:

          o ON_PREMISES

       --instance-role-arn (string) The ARN of the IAM role for  the  Node  in
       this  Cluster. The role must include all the operations that you expect
       these Node to perform. If necessary, create a role in IAM, then  attach
       it here.

       --name  (string)  Specify  a name that is unique in the AWS account. We
       recommend that you assign a name that hints at the types  of  Nodes  in
       the Cluster. Names are case-sensitive.

       --network-settings  (structure) Network settings that connect the Nodes
       in the Cluster to one or more of the Networks that the Cluster is asso-
       ciated with.DefaultRoute -> (string)
              Specify  one  network interface as the default route for traffic
              to and from the Node. MediaLive Anywhere uses this default  when
              the destination for the traffic isn't covered by the route table
              for any of the networks. Specify the value  of  the  appropriate
              logicalInterfaceName  parameter  that  you  create in the inter-
              faceMappings.

          InterfaceMappings -> (list)
              An array of interfaceMapping objects for this Cluster. You  must
              create  a  mapping  for node interfaces that you plan to use for
              encoding traffic. You typically don't create a mapping  for  the
              management  interface. You define this mapping in the Cluster so
              that the mapping can be used by all the Nodes. Each mapping log-
              ically  connects  one  interface  on the nodes with one Network.
              Each mapping consists of a pair of parameters. The logicalInter-
              faceName parameter creates a logical name for the Node interface
              that handles a specific type of  traffic.  For  example,  my-In-
              puts-Interface.  The networkID parameter refers to the ID of the
              network. When you create the Nodes in this Cluster, you will as-
              sociate  the  logicalInterfaceName with the appropriate physical
              interface.

              (structure)
                 Used in ClusterNetworkSettingsCreateRequest.

                 LogicalInterfaceName -> (string)
                     The logical name for one interface (on every  Node)  that
                     handles a specific type of traffic. We recommend that the
                     name hints at the physical interface it applies  to.  For
                     example,  it could refer to the traffic that the physical
                     interface handles. For example, my-Inputs-Interface.

                 NetworkId -> (string)
                     The ID of the network that you want  to  connect  to  the
                     specified logicalInterfaceName.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DefaultRoute=string,InterfaceMappings=[{LogicalInterfaceName=string,NetworkId=string},{LogicalInterfaceName=string,NetworkId=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DefaultRoute": "string",
            "InterfaceMappings": [
              {
                "LogicalInterfaceName": "string",
                "NetworkId": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --request-id (string) The unique ID of the request.

       --tags (map) A collection of key-value pairs.key -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of this Cluster. It is automatically assigned when the Clus-
          ter is created.

       ChannelIds -> (list)
          Placeholder documentation for __listOf__string

          (string)
              Placeholder documentation for __string

       ClusterType -> (string)
          The hardware type for the Cluster

       Id -> (string)
          The  ID of the Cluster. Unique in the AWS account. The ID is the re-
          source-id portion of the ARN.

       InstanceRoleArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the IAM role for the Node in this Cluster. Any Nodes that
          are  associated  with  this Cluster assume this role. The role gives
          permissions to the operations that you expect these Node to perform.

       Name -> (string)
          The name that you specified for the Cluster.

       NetworkSettings -> (structure)
          Network settings that connect the Nodes in the  Cluster  to  one  or
          more of the Networks that the Cluster is associated with.

          DefaultRoute -> (string)
              The  network  interface that is the default route for traffic to
              and from the node. MediaLive Anywhere uses this default when the
              destination for the traffic isn't covered by the route table for
              any of the networks. Specify the value of the appropriate  logi-
              calInterfaceName  parameter that you create in the interfaceMap-
              pings.

          InterfaceMappings -> (list)
              An array of interfaceMapping objects for this Cluster. Each map-
              ping logically connects one interface on the nodes with one Net-
              work. You need only one mapping for each interface  because  all
              the Nodes share the mapping.

              (structure)
                 Used in ClusterNetworkSettings

                 LogicalInterfaceName -> (string)
                     The  logical  name for one interface (on every Node) that
                     handles a specific type of traffic. We recommend that the
                     name  hints  at the physical interface it applies to. For
                     example, it could refer to the traffic that the  physical
                     interface handles. For example, my-Inputs-Interface.

                 NetworkId -> (string)
                     The  ID  of  the  network that you want to connect to the
                     specified logicalInterfaceName.

       State -> (string)
          The current state of the Cluster.
