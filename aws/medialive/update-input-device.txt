OPTIONS
       --hd-device-settings (structure) The settings that you want to apply to
       the HD input device.ConfiguredInput -> (string)
              The input source that you want to  use.  If  the  device  has  a
              source connected to only one of its input ports, or if you don't
              care which source the device sends, specify Auto. If the  device
              has  sources  connected to both its input ports, and you want to
              use a specific source, specify the source.

          MaxBitrate -> (integer)
              The maximum bitrate in bits per second.  Set  a  value  here  to
              throttle the bitrate of the source video.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfiguredInput=string,MaxBitrate=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfiguredInput": "AUTO"|"HDMI"|"SDI",
            "MaxBitrate": integer
          }

       --input-device-id (string) The unique ID of the input device. For exam-
       ple, hd-123456789abcdef.

       --name (string) The name that you assigned to this  input  device  (not
       the unique ID).

       --uhd-device-settings  (structure)  The settings that you want to apply
       to the UHD input device.ConfiguredInput -> (string)
              The input source that you want to  use.  If  the  device  has  a
              source connected to only one of its input ports, or if you don't
              care which source the device sends, specify Auto. If the  device
              has  sources  connected to both its input ports, and you want to
              use a specific source, specify the source.

          MaxBitrate -> (integer)
              The maximum bitrate in bits per second.  Set  a  value  here  to
              throttle the bitrate of the source video.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfiguredInput=string,MaxBitrate=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfiguredInput": "AUTO"|"HDMI"|"SDI",
            "MaxBitrate": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
