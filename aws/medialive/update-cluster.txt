OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string) The ID of the cluster

       --name  (string)  Include this parameter only if you want to change the
       current name of the Cluster. Specify a name that is unique in  the  AWS
       account. You can't change the name. Names are case-sensitive.

       --network-settings  (structure)  Include this property only if you want
       to change the current connections between the Nodes in the Cluster  and
       the Networks the Cluster is associated with.DefaultRoute -> (string)
              Include  this  parameter  only if you want to change the default
              route for the Cluster. Specify one network interface as the  de-
              fault route for traffic to and from the node. MediaLive Anywhere
              uses this default when the destination  for  the  traffic  isn't
              covered  by the route table for any of the networks. Specify the
              value of the appropriate logicalInterfaceName parameter that you
              create in the interfaceMappings.

          InterfaceMappings -> (list)
              An  array  of interfaceMapping objects for this Cluster. Include
              this parameter only if you want to change the interface mappings
              for  the  Cluster.  Typically, you change the interface mappings
              only to fix an error you made when creating the mapping.  In  an
              update  request, make sure that you enter the entire set of map-
              pings again, not just the mappings  that  you  want  to  add  or
              change.  You define this mapping so that the mapping can be used
              by all the Nodes. Each mapping logically connects one  interface
              on  the  nodes with one Network. Each mapping consists of a pair
              of parameters. The logicalInterfaceName parameter creates a log-
              ical name for the Node interface that handles a specific type of
              traffic. For example, my-Inputs-Interface. The networkID parame-
              ter  refers  to the ID of the network. When you create the Nodes
              in this Cluster, you  will  associate  the  logicalInterfaceName
              with the appropriate physical interface.

                 Placeholder documentation for InterfaceMappingUpdateRequest

                 LogicalInterfaceName -> (string)
                     The  logical  name for one interface (on every Node) that
                     handles a specific type of traffic. We recommend that the
                     name  hints  at the physical interface it applies to. For
                     example, it could refer to the traffic that the  physical
                     interface handles. For example, my-Inputs-Interface.

                 NetworkId -> (string)
                     The  ID  of  the  network that you want to connect to the
                     specified logicalInterfaceName. You can use the  ListNet-
                     works operation to discover all the IDs.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DefaultRoute=string,InterfaceMappings=[{LogicalInterfaceName=string,NetworkId=string},{LogicalInterfaceName=string,NetworkId=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DefaultRoute": "string",
            "InterfaceMappings": [
              {
                "LogicalInterfaceName": "string",
                "NetworkId": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the Cluster.

       ChannelIds -> (list)
          An array of the IDs of the Channels that are  associated  with  this
          Cluster.  One  Channel  is associated with the Cluster as follows: A
          Channel belongs to a ChannelPlacementGroup. A  ChannelPlacementGroup
          is attached to a Node. A Node belongs to a Cluster.

          (string)
              Placeholder documentation for __string

       ClusterType -> (string)
          The hardware type for the Cluster

       Id -> (string)
          The unique ID of the Cluster.

       Name -> (string)
          The user-specified name of the Cluster.

       NetworkSettings -> (structure)
          Network  settings  that  connect  the Nodes in the Cluster to one or
          more of the Networks that the Cluster is associated with.

          DefaultRoute -> (string)
              The network interface that is the default route for  traffic  to
              and from the node. MediaLive Anywhere uses this default when the
              destination for the traffic isn't covered by the route table for
              any  of the networks. Specify the value of the appropriate logi-
              calInterfaceName parameter that you create in the  interfaceMap-
              pings.

          InterfaceMappings -> (list)
              An array of interfaceMapping objects for this Cluster. Each map-
              ping logically connects one interface on the nodes with one Net-
              work.  You  need only one mapping for each interface because all
              the Nodes share the mapping.

              (structure)
                 Used in ClusterNetworkSettings

                 LogicalInterfaceName -> (string)
                     The logical name for one interface (on every  Node)  that
                     handles a specific type of traffic. We recommend that the
                     name hints at the physical interface it applies  to.  For
                     example,  it could refer to the traffic that the physical
                     interface handles. For example, my-Inputs-Interface.

                 NetworkId -> (string)
                     The ID of the network that you want  to  connect  to  the
                     specified logicalInterfaceName.

       State -> (string)
          The current state of the Cluster.
