OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. Idempotency ensures that an API  request
          completes only once. With an idempotent request, if the original re-
          quest completes  successfully,  subsequent  retries  with  the  same
          client token return the result from the original successful request.

          If you do not specify a client token, one is automatically generated
          by the Amazon Web Services SDK.

       --data-protection-settings-arn (string)
          The ARN of the data protection settings.

       --description (string)
          The description of the data protection settings.

       --display-name (string)
          The display name of the data protection settings.

       --inline-redaction-configuration (structure)
          The inline redaction configuration of the data  protection  settings
          that will be applied to all sessions.

          globalConfidenceLevel -> (integer)
              The  global confidence level for the inline redaction configura-
              tion. This indicates the certainty of data type matches  in  the
              redaction process. Confidence level 3 means high confidence, and
              requires a formatted text pattern match in order for content  to
              be  redacted.  Confidence  level  2 means medium confidence, and
              redaction considers both formatted  and  unformatted  text,  and
              adds  keyword  associate  to the logic. Confidence level 1 means
              low confidence, and redaction is  enforced  for  both  formatted
              pattern  +  unformatted pattern without keyword. This is applied
              to patterns that do not have a pattern-level  confidence  level.
              Defaults to confidence level 2.

          globalEnforcedUrls -> (list)
              The  global  enforced URL configuration for the inline redaction
              configuration. This is applied to patterns that do  not  have  a
              pattern-level enforced URL list.

              (string)

          globalExemptUrls -> (list)
              The  global  exempt  URL  configuration for the inline redaction
              configuration. This is applied to patterns that do  not  have  a
              pattern-level exempt URL list.

              (string)

          inlineRedactionPatterns -> (list)
              The  inline  redaction  patterns  to  be  enabled for the inline
              redaction configuration.

              (structure)
                 The set of patterns that determine the data types redacted in
                 session.

                 builtInPatternId -> (string)
                     The  built-in pattern from the list of preconfigured pat-
                     terns. Either a customPattern or builtInPatternId is  re-
                     quired.

                 confidenceLevel -> (integer)
                     The  confidence  level for inline redaction pattern. This
                     indicates the certainty  of  data  type  matches  in  the
                     redaction  process.  Confidence level 3 means high confi-
                     dence, and requires a formatted text pattern match in or-
                     der  for content to be redacted. Confidence level 2 means
                     medium confidence, and redaction considers both formatted
                     and  unformatted  text, and adds keyword associate to the
                     logic. Confidence  level  1  means  low  confidence,  and
                     redaction is enforced for both formatted pattern + unfor-
                     matted pattern without keyword. This overrides the global
                     confidence level.

                 customPattern -> (structure)
                     >The configuration for a custom pattern. Either a custom-
                     Pattern or builtInPatternId is required.

                     keywordRegex -> (string)
                        The keyword regex  for  the  customer  pattern.  After
                        there  is  a  match  to the pattern regex, the keyword
                        regex is used to search within the  proximity  of  the
                        match.  If there is a keyword match, then the match is
                        confirmed. If no keyword regex is provided,  the  pat-
                        tern  regex match will automatically be confirmed. The
                        format must follow JavaScript regex format.  The  pat-
                        tern  must  be  enclosed between slashes, and can have
                        flags behind the second slash. For example, /ab+c/gi

                     patternDescription -> (string)
                        The pattern description for the customer pattern.

                     patternName -> (string)
                        The pattern name for the custom pattern.

                     patternRegex -> (string)
                        The pattern regex for the customer pattern. The format
                        must  follow JavaScript regex format. The pattern must
                        be enclosed between slashes, and can have flags behind
                        the second slash. For example: /ab+c/gi.

                 enforcedUrls -> (list)
                     The  enforced  URL configuration for the inline redaction
                     pattern. This will override the global enforced URL  con-
                     figuration.

                     (string)

                 exemptUrls -> (list)
                     The  exempt  URL  configuration  for the inline redaction
                     pattern. This will override the global exempt URL config-
                     uration for the inline redaction pattern.

                     (string)

                 redactionPlaceHolder -> (structure)
                     The  redaction placeholder that will replace the redacted
                     text in session for the inline redaction pattern.

                     redactionPlaceHolderText -> (string)
                        The redaction placeholder text that will  replace  the
                        redacted text in session for the custom text redaction
                        placeholder type.

                     redactionPlaceHolderType -> (string)
                        The redaction placeholder type that will  replace  the
                        redacted text in session.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 The global confidence level for the inline redaction configu-
                 ration. This indicates the certainty of data type matches  in
                 the  redaction  process. Confidence level 3 means high confi-
                 dence, and requires a formatted text pattern match  in  order
                 for  content  to be redacted. Confidence level 2 means medium
                 confidence, and redaction considers both formatted and unfor-
                 matted  text, and adds keyword associate to the logic. Confi-
                 dence level 1 means low confidence, and redaction is enforced
                 for both formatted pattern + unformatted pattern without key-
                 word. This is applied to patterns that do  not  have  a  pat-

                 pattern-level exempt URL list.

                 (string)

              inlineRedactionPatterns -> (list)
                 The  inline  redaction  patterns to be enabled for the inline
                 redaction configuration.

                 (structure)
                     The  set  of  patterns  that  determine  the  data  types
                     redacted in session.

                     builtInPatternId -> (string)
                        The  built-in  pattern  from the list of preconfigured
                        patterns. Either a customPattern  or  builtInPatternId
                        is required.

                     confidenceLevel -> (integer)
                        The  confidence  level  for  inline redaction pattern.
                        This indicates the certainty of data type  matches  in
                        the  redaction  process. Confidence level 3 means high
                        confidence, and  requires  a  formatted  text  pattern
                        match  in order for content to be redacted. Confidence
                        level 2 means medium confidence, and redaction consid-
                        ers both formatted and unformatted text, and adds key-
                        word associate to the logic. Confidence level 1  means
                        low  confidence,  and  redaction  is enforced for both
                        formatted pattern + unformatted pattern  without  key-
                        word. This overrides the global confidence level.

                     customPattern -> (structure)
                        >The configuration for a custom pattern. Either a cus-
                        tomPattern or builtInPatternId is required.

                        keywordRegex -> (string)
                            The keyword regex for the customer pattern.  After
                            there is a match to the pattern regex, the keyword
                            regex is used to search within  the  proximity  of
                            the  match.  If there is a keyword match, then the
                            match is confirmed. If no keyword  regex  is  pro-
                            vided,  the pattern regex match will automatically
                            be confirmed. The format  must  follow  JavaScript
                            regex format. The pattern must be enclosed between
                            slashes, and can  have  flags  behind  the  second
                            slash. For example, /ab+c/gi

                        patternDescription -> (string)

                            The  pattern  regex  for the customer pattern. The
                            format must follow JavaScript  regex  format.  The
                            pattern  must be enclosed between slashes, and can
                            have flags behind the second slash.  For  example:
                            /ab+c/gi.

                     enforcedUrls -> (list)
                        The  enforced  URL configuration for the inline redac-
                        tion pattern. This will override the  global  enforced
                        URL configuration.

                        (string)

                     exemptUrls -> (list)
                        The  exempt URL configuration for the inline redaction
                        pattern. This will override the global exempt URL con-
                        figuration for the inline redaction pattern.

                        (string)

                     redactionPlaceHolder -> (structure)
                        The   redaction  placeholder  that  will  replace  the
