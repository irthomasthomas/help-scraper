OPTIONS
       --data-protection-settings-arn (string)
          The ARN of the data protection settings.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       dataProtectionSettings -> (structure)
          The data protection settings.

          additionalEncryptionContext -> (map)
              The  additional  encryption  context of the data protection set-
              tings.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          associatedPortalArns -> (list)
              A list of web portal ARNs that this data protection settings re-
              source is associated with.

              (string)

          creationDate -> (timestamp)
              The creation date timestamp of the data protection settings.

          customerManagedKey -> (string)
              The  customer  managed key used to encrypt sensitive information
              in the data protection settings.

          dataProtectionSettingsArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the data protection settings resource.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the data protection settings.

          displayName -> (string)
              The display name of the data protection settings.

          inlineRedactionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The inline redaction configuration for the data protection  set-
              tings.

              globalConfidenceLevel -> (integer)
                 The global confidence level for the inline redaction configu-
                 ration. This indicates the certainty of data type matches  in
                 the  redaction  process. Confidence level 3 means high confi-
                 dence, and requires a formatted text pattern match  in  order
                 for  content  to be redacted. Confidence level 2 means medium
                 confidence, and redaction considers both formatted and unfor-
                 matted  text, and adds keyword associate to the logic. Confi-
                 dence level 1 means low confidence, and redaction is enforced
                 for both formatted pattern + unformatted pattern without key-
                 word. This is applied to patterns that do  not  have  a  pat-
                 tern-level confidence level. Defaults to confidence level 2.

              globalEnforcedUrls -> (list)
                 The  global  enforced URL configuration for the inline redac-
                 tion configuration. This is applied to patterns that  do  not
                 have a pattern-level enforced URL list.

                 (string)

              globalExemptUrls -> (list)
                 The  global exempt URL configuration for the inline redaction
                 configuration. This is applied to patterns that do not have a
                 pattern-level exempt URL list.

                 (string)

              inlineRedactionPatterns -> (list)
                 The  inline  redaction  patterns to be enabled for the inline
                 redaction configuration.

                 (structure)
                     The  set  of  patterns  that  determine  the  data  types
                     redacted in session.

                     builtInPatternId -> (string)
                        The  built-in  pattern  from the list of preconfigured
                        patterns. Either a customPattern  or  builtInPatternId
                        is required.

                     confidenceLevel -> (integer)
                        The  confidence  level  for  inline redaction pattern.
                        This indicates the certainty of data type  matches  in
                        the  redaction  process. Confidence level 3 means high
                        confidence, and  requires  a  formatted  text  pattern
                        match  in order for content to be redacted. Confidence
                        level 2 means medium confidence, and redaction consid-
                        ers both formatted and unformatted text, and adds key-
                        word associate to the logic. Confidence level 1  means
                        low  confidence,  and  redaction  is enforced for both
                        formatted pattern + unformatted pattern  without  key-
                        word. This overrides the global confidence level.

                     customPattern -> (structure)
                        >The configuration for a custom pattern. Either a cus-
                        tomPattern or builtInPatternId is required.

                        keywordRegex -> (string)
                            The keyword regex for the customer pattern.  After
                            there is a match to the pattern regex, the keyword
                            regex is used to search within  the  proximity  of
                            the  match.  If there is a keyword match, then the
                            match is confirmed. If no keyword  regex  is  pro-
                            vided,  the pattern regex match will automatically
                            be confirmed. The format  must  follow  JavaScript
                            regex format. The pattern must be enclosed between
                            slashes, and can  have  flags  behind  the  second
                            slash. For example, /ab+c/gi

                        patternDescription -> (string)
                            The pattern description for the customer pattern.

                        patternName -> (string)
                            The pattern name for the custom pattern.

                        patternRegex -> (string)
                            The  pattern  regex  for the customer pattern. The
                            format must follow JavaScript  regex  format.  The
                            pattern  must be enclosed between slashes, and can
                            have flags behind the second slash.  For  example:
                            /ab+c/gi.

                     enforcedUrls -> (list)
                        The  enforced  URL configuration for the inline redac-
                        tion pattern. This will override the  global  enforced
                        URL configuration.

                        (string)

                     exemptUrls -> (list)
                        The  exempt URL configuration for the inline redaction
                        pattern. This will override the global exempt URL con-
                        figuration for the inline redaction pattern.

                        (string)

                     redactionPlaceHolder -> (structure)
                        The   redaction  placeholder  that  will  replace  the
                        redacted text in session for the inline redaction pat-
                        tern.

                        redactionPlaceHolderText -> (string)
                            The  redaction  placeholder text that will replace
                            the redacted text in session for the  custom  text
                            redaction placeholder type.

                        redactionPlaceHolderType -> (string)
                            The  redaction  placeholder type that will replace
                            the redacted text in session.
