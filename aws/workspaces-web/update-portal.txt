OPTIONS
       --authentication-type (string)
          The type of authentication integration points used when signing into
          the web portal. Defaults to Standard .
              Standard web portals are  authenticated  directly  through  your
              identity  provider.  You  need to call CreateIdentityProvider to
              integrate your identity provider with your web portal. User  and
              group access to your web portal is controlled through your iden-
              tity provider.

              IAM Identity Center web portals are  authenticated  through  IAM
              Identity  Center.  Identity sources (including external identity
              provider integration), plus user and group access  to  your  web
              portal, can be configured in the IAM Identity Center.

          Possible values:

          o Standard

          o IAM_Identity_Center

       --display-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  web portal. This is not visible to users who log
          into the web portal.

       --instance-type (string)
          The type and resources of the underlying instance.

          Possible values:

          o standard.regular

          o standard.large

          o standard.xlarge

       --max-concurrent-sessions (integer)
          The maximum number of concurrent sessions for the portal.

       --portal-arn (string)
          The ARN of the web portal.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
