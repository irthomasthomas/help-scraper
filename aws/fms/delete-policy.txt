OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The  ID of the policy that you want to delete. You can retrieve this
          ID from PutPolicy and ListPolicies .

       --delete-all-policy-resources | --no-delete-all-policy-resources (bool-
       ean)
          If True , the request performs cleanup according to the policy type.

          For  WAF  and Shield Advanced policies, the cleanup does the follow-
          ing:

          o Deletes rule groups created by Firewall Manager

          o Removes web ACLs from in-scope resources

          o Deletes web ACLs that contain no rules or rule groups

          For security group policies, the cleanup does the following for each
          security group in the policy:

          o Disassociates the security group from in-scope resources

          o Deletes the security group if it was created through Firewall Man-
            ager and if it's no longer associated with any  resources  through
            another policy

          NOTE:
              For security group common policies, even if set to False , Fire-
              wall Manager deletes all security  groups  created  by  Firewall
              Manager  that aren't associated with any other resources through
              another policy.

          After the cleanup, in-scope resources are no longer protected by web
          ACLs  in  this  policy. Protection of out-of-scope resources remains
          unchanged. Scope is determined by tags that you create and  accounts
          that you associate with the policy. When creating the policy, if you
          specify that only resources in specific accounts  or  with  specific
          tags  are  in  scope of the policy, those accounts and resources are
          handled by the policy. All others are out of  scope.  If  you  don't
          specify tags or accounts, all resources are in scope.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a Firewall Manager policy

       The  following delete-policy example removes the policy with the speci-
       fied ID, along with all of its resources.

          aws fms delete-policy \
              --policy-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --delete-all-policy-resources

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Working with AWS Firewall Manager Policies in
       the  AWS  WAF,  AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced Developer
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
