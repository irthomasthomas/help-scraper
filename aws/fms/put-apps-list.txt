       Shorthand Syntax:

          ListId=string,ListName=string,ListUpdateToken=string,CreateTime=timestamp,LastUpdateTime=timestamp,AppsList=[{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long},{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long}],PreviousAppsList={KeyName1=[{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long},{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long}],KeyName2=[{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long},{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long}]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ListId": "string",
            "ListName": "string",
            "ListUpdateToken": "string",

                "AppName": "string",
                "Protocol": "string",
                "Port": long
              }

                ]
              ...}
          }

       --tag-list (list)
          The tags associated with the resource.

          (structure)
              A collection of key:value pairs associated with  an  Amazon  Web
              Services  resource.  The  key:value pair can be anything you de-
              fine. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "en-
              vironment") and the tag value represents a specific value within
              that category (such as "test," "development," or  "production").
              You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag key to describe a category of information, such as  "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag value to describe a specific  value  within  a  category,
                 such  as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
