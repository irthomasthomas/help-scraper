OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a MaxResults setting, if the
          number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          maximum you requested, Firewall Manager returns a NextToken value in
          the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use  the  token
          returned from the prior request in your next request.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of objects that you want Firewall Manager to re-
          turn for this request. If more objects are  available,  in  the  re-
          sponse, Firewall Manager provides a NextToken value that you can use
          in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResourceSets -> (list)
          An array of ResourceSetSummary objects.

          (structure)
              Summarizes the resource sets used in a policy.

              Id -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the resource set. This ID is returned
                 in the responses to create and list commands. You provide  it
                 to operations like update and delete.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  descriptive  name  of the resource set. You can't change
                 the name of a resource set after you create it.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the resource set.

              LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time that the resource set was changed.

              ResourceSetStatus -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the resource set is in or out of an admin's
                 Region scope.

                 o ACTIVE  -  The  administrator can manage and delete the re-
                   source set.

                 o OUT_OF_ADMIN_SCOPE - The administrator  can  view  the  re-
                   source set, but they can't edit or delete the resource set.
                   Existing protections stay in place. Any new  resource  that
                   come into scope of the resource set won't be protected.

       NextToken -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a MaxResults setting, if the
          number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          maximum you requested, Firewall Manager returns a NextToken value in
          the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use  the  token
          returned from the prior request in your next request.
