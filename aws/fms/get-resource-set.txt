OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          A unique identifier for the resource set, used in a TODO to refer to
          the resource set.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResourceSet -> (structure)
          Information about the specified resource set.

          Id -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the resource set. This ID is returned in
              the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to op-
              erations like update and delete.

          Name -> (string)
              The  descriptive  name of the resource set. You can't change the
              name of a resource set after you create it.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the resource set.

          UpdateToken -> (string)
              An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Fire-
              wall  Manager  returns  a token to your requests that access the
              resource set. The token marks the state of the resource set  re-
              source at the time of the request. Update tokens are not allowed
              when creating a resource set. After  creation,  each  subsequent
              update call to the resource set requires the update token.

              To  make  an  unconditional change to the resource set, omit the
              token in your update request. Without the token,  Firewall  Man-
              ager  performs  your  updates regardless of whether the resource
              set has changed since you last retrieved it.

              To make a conditional change to the resource  set,  provide  the
              token in your update request. Firewall Manager uses the token to
              ensure that the resource set hasn't changed since you  last  re-
              trieved  it.  If it has changed, the operation fails with an In-
              validTokenException . If this happens, retrieve the resource set
              again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your
              changes as needed, then try the operation again  using  the  new
              token.

          ResourceTypeList -> (list)
              Determines  the resources that can be associated to the resource
              set. Depending on your setting for max results and the number of
              resource sets, a single call might not return the full list.

              (string)

          LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time that the resource set was changed.

       ResourceSetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource set.
