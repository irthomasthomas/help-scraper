OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The ID of the Firewall Manager policy that you want the details for.
          You can get violation details for the following policy types:

          o DNS Firewall

          o Imported Network Firewall

          o Network Firewall

          o Security group content audit

          o Network ACL

          o Third-party firewall

       --member-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID that you want the details for.

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the resource that has violations.

       --resource-type (string)
          The  resource  type.  This  is in the format shown in the Amazon Web
          Services Resource Types Reference . Supported  resource  types  are:
          AWS::EC2::Instance  , AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface , AWS::EC2::Securi-
          tyGroup , AWS::NetworkFirewall::FirewallPolicy , and  AWS::EC2::Sub-
          net .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

                                   Describes a rule in a network ACL.

                                   Each  network  ACL  has  a  set of numbered
                                   ingress rules and a separate  set  of  num-
                                   bered   egress   rules.   When  determining
                                   whether a packet should be  allowed  in  or
                                   out of a subnet associated with the network
                                   ACL, Amazon Web Services processes the  en-
                                   tries  in  the network ACL according to the
                                   rule numbers, in ascending order.

                                   When you manage an individual network  ACL,
                                   you  explicitly  specify  the rule numbers.
                                   When you specify the network ACL rules in a
                                   Firewall  Manager  policy,  you provide the
                                   rules to run first, in the order  that  you
                                   want  them  to  run,  and  the rules to run
                                   last, in the order that you  want  them  to
                                   run. Firewall Manager assigns the rule num-
                                   bers for you when you save the network  ACL

                                      The IPv6 network range to allow or deny,
                                      in CIDR notation.

                                   RuleAction -> (string)
                                      Indicates whether to allow or  deny  the
                                      traffic that matches the rule.

                                   Egress -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates whether the rule is an egress,
                                      or outbound, rule  (applied  to  traffic
                                      leaving  the  subnet).  If  it's  not an
                                      egress rule, then it's  an  ingress,  or
                                      inbound, rule.

                               EntryRuleNumber -> (integer)
                                   The  rule number for the entry. ACL entries
                                   are processed in ascending  order  by  rule
                                   number.  In  a Firewall Manager network ACL
                                   policy, Firewall Manager assigns rule  num-
                                   bers.

                               EntryType -> (string)
                                   Specifies  whether  the entry is managed by
                                   Firewall Manager or by  a  user,  and,  for
                                   Firewall Manager-managed entries, specifies
                                   whether the entry is among those  that  run
                                   first  in the network ACL or those that run
                                   last.

                            ExpectedEvaluationOrder -> (string)
                               The evaluation location within the ordered list
                               of  entries  where the ExpectedEntry should be,
                               according to the network ACL policy  specifica-
                               tions.

                            ActualEvaluationOrder -> (string)
                               The evaluation location within the ordered list
                               of entries where the ExpectedEntry is currently
                               located.

                            EntryAtExpectedEvaluationOrder -> (structure)
                               The entry that's currently in the ExpectedEval-
                               uationOrder location, in place of the  expected
                               entry.

                               EntryDetail -> (structure)
                                   Describes a rule in a network ACL.

                                   Each  network  ACL  has  a  set of numbered
                                   ingress rules and a separate  set  of  num-
                                   bered   egress   rules.   When  determining
                                   whether a packet should be  allowed  in  or
                                   out of a subnet associated with the network
                                   ACL, Amazon Web Services processes the  en-
                                   tries  in  the network ACL according to the
                                   rule numbers, in ascending order.

                                   When you manage an individual network  ACL,
                                   you  explicitly  specify  the rule numbers.
                                   When you specify the network ACL rules in a
                                   Firewall  Manager  policy,  you provide the
                                   rules to run first, in the order  that  you
                                   want  them  to  run,  and  the rules to run
                                   last, in the order that you  want  them  to
                                   run. Firewall Manager assigns the rule num-
                                   bers for you when you save the network  ACL
                                   policy specification.

                                          range.

                                      To -> (integer)
                                          The ending port number of the range.

                                      The IPv4 network range to allow or deny,
                                      in CIDR notation.

                                   Ipv6CidrBlock -> (string)
                                      The IPv6 network range to allow or deny,
                                      in CIDR notation.

                                   RuleAction -> (string)
                                      Indicates whether to allow or  deny  the
                                      traffic that matches the rule.

                                   Egress -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates whether the rule is an egress,
                                      or outbound, rule  (applied  to  traffic
                                      leaving  the  subnet).  If  it's  not an
                                      egress rule, then it's  an  ingress,  or
                                      inbound, rule.

                               EntryRuleNumber -> (integer)
                                   The  rule number for the entry. ACL entries
                                   are processed in ascending  order  by  rule
                                   number.  In  a Firewall Manager network ACL
                                   policy, Firewall Manager assigns rule  num-
                                   bers.

                               EntryType -> (string)
                                   Specifies  whether  the entry is managed by
                                   Firewall Manager or by  a  user,  and,  for
                                   Firewall Manager-managed entries, specifies
                                   whether the entry is among those  that  run
                                   first  in the network ACL or those that run
                                   last.

                            EntriesWithConflicts -> (list)
                               The list of entries that are in  conflict  with
                               ExpectedEntry .

                               (structure)
                                   Describes a single rule in a network ACL.

                                   EntryDetail -> (structure)
                                      Describes a rule in a network ACL.

                                      Each  network  ACL has a set of numbered
                                      ingress rules and a separate set of num-
                                      bered  egress  rules.  When  determining
                                      whether a packet should be allowed in or
                                      out of a subnet associated with the net-
                                      work ACL, Amazon Web Services  processes
                                      the entries in the network ACL according
                                      to the rule numbers, in ascending order.

                                      When you manage  an  individual  network
                                      ACL,  you  explicitly  specify  the rule
                                      numbers. When you  specify  the  network
                                      ACL  rules in a Firewall Manager policy,
                                      you provide the rules to run  first,  in
                                      the order that you want them to run, and
                                      the rules to run last, in the order that
                                      you  want  them to run. Firewall Manager
                                      assigns the rule numbers  for  you  when
                                      you save the network ACL policy specifi-
                                      cation.

              (structure)
                 A collection of key:value pairs associated with an Amazon Web
                 Services resource. The key:value pair can be anything you de-
                 fine.  Typically,  the tag key represents a category (such as
                 "environment") and the tag value represents a specific  value
                 within that category (such as "test," "development," or "pro-
                 duction"). You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web  Ser-
                 vices resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Part  of  the  key:value pair that defines a tag. You can
                     use a tag key to describe a category of information, such
                     as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Part  of  the  key:value pair that defines a tag. You can

                     category,  such  as  "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values
                     are case-sensitive.

          ResourceDescription -> (string)
              Brief description for the requested resource.
