LIST-THIRD-PARTY-FIREWALL-FIREWALLIST-THIRD-PARTY-FIREWALL-FIREWALL-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-third-party-firewall-firewall-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list of all of the third-party firewall policies that are
       associated with the third-party firewall administrator's account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-third-party-firewall-firewall-policies is a  paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults  of  the  following  query  expressions:  ThirdPartyFirewallFire-
       wallPolicies

SYNOPSIS
            list-third-party-firewall-firewall-policies
          --third-party-firewall <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --third-party-firewall (string)
          The name of the third-party firewall vendor.

          Possible values:

          o PALO_ALTO_NETWORKS_CLOUD_NGFW

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ThirdPartyFirewallFirewallPolicies -> (list)
          A list that contains one ThirdPartyFirewallFirewallPolicies  element
          for   each   third-party   firewall   policies  that  the  specified
          third-party firewall vendor is associated with. Each ThirdPartyFire-
          wallFirewallPolicies  element  contains the firewall policy name and
          ID.

          (structure)
              Configures the third-party firewall's firewall policy.

              FirewallPolicyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the specified firewall policy.

              FirewallPolicyName -> (string)
                 The name of the specified firewall policy.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The value that you will use for NextToken in the next  ListThirdPar-
          tyFirewallFirewallPolicies request.
