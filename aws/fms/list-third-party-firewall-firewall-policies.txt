LIST-THIRD-PARTY-FIREWALL-FIREWALLIST-THIRD-PARTY-FIREWALL-FIREWALL-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-third-party-firewall-firewall-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list of all of the third-party firewall policies that are
       associated with the third-party firewall administrator's account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-third-party-firewall-firewall-policies is a  paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults  of  the  following  query  expressions:  ThirdPartyFirewallFire-
       wallPolicies

OPTIONS
       --third-party-firewall (string)
          The name of the third-party firewall vendor.

          Possible values:

          o PALO_ALTO_NETWORKS_CLOUD_NGFW

          o FORTIGATE_CLOUD_NATIVE_FIREWALL

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ThirdPartyFirewallFirewallPolicies -> (list)
          A list that contains one ThirdPartyFirewallFirewallPolicies  element
          for   each   third-party   firewall   policies  that  the  specified
          third-party firewall vendor is associated with. Each ThirdPartyFire-
          wallFirewallPolicies  element  contains the firewall policy name and
          ID.

          (structure)
              Configures the third-party firewall's firewall policy.

              FirewallPolicyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the specified firewall policy.

              FirewallPolicyName -> (string)
                 The name of the specified firewall policy.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The value that you will use for NextToken in the next  ListThirdPar-
          tyFirewallFirewallPolicies request.
