LIST-POLICIES()                                                LIST-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of PolicySummary objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-policies  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PolicyList

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve all Firewall Manager policies

       The  following list-policies example retrieves the list of policies for
       the account. In this example, the output is limited to two results  per
       request.  Each  call  returns a NextToken that can be used as the value
       for the --starting-token parameter in the next  list-policies  call  to
       get the next set of results for the list.

          aws fms list-policies \
              --max-items 2

       Output:

          {
              "PolicyList": [
                  {
                      "PolicyArn": "arn:aws:fms:us-west-2:123456789012:policy/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",

OUTPUT
       PolicyList -> (list)
          An array of PolicySummary objects.

          (structure)
              Details of the Firewall Manager policy.

              PolicyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the specified policy.

              PolicyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the specified policy.

              PolicyName -> (string)
                 The name of the specified policy.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type of resource protected by or in scope of the policy.
                 This is in the format shown in the Amazon  Web  Services  Re-
                 source  Types  Reference . For WAF and Shield Advanced, exam-
                 ples  include  AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer  and
                 AWS::CloudFront::Distribution  .  For a security group common
                 policy,  valid  values  are  AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface   and
                 AWS::EC2::Instance  . For a security group content audit pol-
                 icy,   valid    values    are    AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup    ,
                 AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface  ,  and AWS::EC2::Instance . For a
                 security group usage audit policy, the value is AWS::EC2::Se-
                 curityGroup  . For an Network Firewall policy or DNS Firewall
                 policy, the value is AWS::EC2::VPC .

              SecurityServiceType -> (string)
                 The service that the policy  is  using  to  protect  the  re-
                 sources.  This  specifies the type of policy that is created,
                 either an WAF policy, a Shield Advanced policy, or a security
                 group policy.

              RemediationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  if  the  policy should be automatically applied to
                 new resources.

              DeleteUnusedFMManagedResources -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether Firewall Manager should  automatically  re-
                 move  protections  from resources that leave the policy scope
                 and clean up resources that Firewall Manager is managing  for
                 accounts when those accounts leave policy scope. For example,
                 Firewall Manager will disassociate a Firewall Manager managed
                 web  ACL from a protected customer resource when the customer
                 resource leaves policy scope.

                 By default, Firewall Manager doesn't  remove  protections  or
                 delete Firewall Manager managed resources.

                 This option is not available for Shield Advanced or WAF Clas-
                 sic policies.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If you have more PolicySummary objects  than  the  number  that  you
          specified  for  MaxResults  in  the request, the response includes a
          NextToken value. To list more PolicySummary objects, submit  another
          ListPolicies  request,  and specify the NextToken value from the re-
          sponse in the NextToken value in the next request.
