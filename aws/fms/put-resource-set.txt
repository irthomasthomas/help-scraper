OPTIONS
       --resource-set (structure)
          Details about the resource set to be created or updated.>

          Id -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the resource set. This ID is returned in
              the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to op-
              erations like update and delete.

          Name -> (string)
              The descriptive name of the resource set. You can't  change  the
              name of a resource set after you create it.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the resource set.

          UpdateToken -> (string)
              An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Fire-
              wall Manager returns a token to your requests  that  access  the
              resource  set. The token marks the state of the resource set re-
              source at the time of the request. Update tokens are not allowed
              when  creating  a  resource set. After creation, each subsequent
              update call to the resource set requires the update token.

              To make an unconditional change to the resource  set,  omit  the
              token  in  your update request. Without the token, Firewall Man-
              ager performs your updates regardless of  whether  the  resource
              set has changed since you last retrieved it.

              To  make  a  conditional change to the resource set, provide the
              token in your update request. Firewall Manager uses the token to
              ensure  that  the resource set hasn't changed since you last re-
              trieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with  an  In-
              validTokenException . If this happens, retrieve the resource set
              again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your
              changes  as  needed,  then try the operation again using the new
              token.

          ResourceTypeList -> (list)
              Determines the resources that can be associated to the  resource
              set. Depending on your setting for max results and the number of
              resource sets, a single call might not return the full list.

              (string)

          LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time that the resource set was changed.

          ResourceSetStatus -> (string)
              Indicates whether the resource set is in or out  of  an  admin's
              Region scope.

              o ACTIVE  - The administrator can manage and delete the resource
                set.

              o OUT_OF_ADMIN_SCOPE - The administrator can view  the  resource
                set,  but they can't edit or delete the resource set. Existing
                protections stay in place. Any new  resource  that  come  into
                scope of the resource set won't be protected.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,Name=string,Description=string,UpdateToken=string,ResourceTypeList=string,string,LastUpdateTime=timestamp,ResourceSetStatus=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Id": "string",
            "Name": "string",
            "Description": "string",
            "UpdateToken": "string",
            "ResourceTypeList": ["string", ...],
            "LastUpdateTime": timestamp,
            "ResourceSetStatus": "ACTIVE"|"OUT_OF_ADMIN_SCOPE"
          }

       --tag-list (list)
          Retrieves  the tags associated with the specified resource set. Tags
          are key:value pairs that you can use to categorize and  manage  your
          resources, for purposes like billing. For example, you might set the
          tag key to "customer" and the value to the customer name or ID.  You
          can  specify one or more tags to add to each Amazon Web Services re-
          source, up to 50 tags for a resource.

          (structure)
              A collection of key:value pairs associated with  an  Amazon  Web
              Services  resource.  The  key:value pair can be anything you de-
              fine. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "en-
              vironment") and the tag value represents a specific value within
              that category (such as "test," "development," or  "production").
              You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag key to describe a category of information, such as  "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag value to describe a specific  value  within  a  category,
                 such  as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
