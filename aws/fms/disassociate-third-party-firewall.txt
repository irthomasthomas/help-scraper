SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-third-party-firewall
          --third-party-firewall <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --third-party-firewall (string)
          The name of the third-party firewall vendor.

          Possible values:

          o PALO_ALTO_NETWORKS_CLOUD_NGFW

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ThirdPartyFirewallStatus -> (string)
          The  current status for the disassociation of a Firewall Manager ad-
          ministrators account with a third-party firewall.
