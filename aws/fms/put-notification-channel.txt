PUT-NOTIFICATION-CHANNEL()                          PUT-NOTIFICATION-CHANNEL()



NAME
       put-notification-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Designates  the  IAM  role and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
       topic that Firewall Manager uses to record SNS logs.

       To perform this action outside of the console, you must  configure  the
       SNS  topic  to  allow the Firewall Manager role AWSServiceRoleForFMS to
       publish SNS logs. For more information, see Firewall  Manager  required
       permissions for API actions in the Firewall Manager Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic that collects noti-
          fications from Firewall Manager.

       --sns-role-name (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role  that  allows  Amazon
          SNS to record Firewall Manager activity.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set the SNS topic information for Firewall Manager logs

       The  following  put-notification-channel example sets the SNS topic in-
       formation.

          aws fms put-notification-channel \
              --sns-topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:us-west-2-fms \
              --sns-role-name arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-service-role/fms.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForFMS

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Configure Amazon SNS Notifications and Amazon
       CloudWatch  Alarms in the AWS WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield
       Advanced Developer Guide.
