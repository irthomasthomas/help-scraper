NAME
       get-sol-network-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the details of the network instance.

       A  network  instance is a single network created in Amazon Web Services
       TNB that can be deployed and on which life-cycle operations (like  ter-
       minate, update, and delete) can be performed.

OPTIONS
       --ns-instance-id (string)
          ID of the network instance.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          Network instance ARN.

       id -> (string)
          Network instance ID.

       lcmOpInfo -> (structure)
          Lifecycle management operation details on the network instance.

          Lifecycle management operations are deploy, update, or delete opera-
          tions.

          nsLcmOpOccId -> (string)
              The identifier of the network operation.

       metadata -> (structure)
          The metadata of a network instance.

          A network instance is a single network created in  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  TNB  that  can be deployed and on which life-cycle operations
          (like terminate, update, and delete) can be performed.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The date that the resource was created.

          vices costs.

          key -> (string)
