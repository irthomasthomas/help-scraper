NAME
       create-sol-network-package -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a network package.

       A network package is a .zip file in CSAR (Cloud Service Archive) format
       defines the function packages you want to deploy  and  the  Amazon  Web
       Services  infrastructure  you want to deploy them on. For more informa-
       tion, see Network instances in the Amazon Web  Services  Telco  Network
       Builder User Guide .

       A  network  package consists of a network service descriptor (NSD) file
       (required) and any additional files (optional), such  as  scripts  spe-
       cific  to  your needs. For example, if you have multiple function pack-
       ages in your network package, you can use the NSD to define which  net-
       work functions should run in certain VPCs, subnets, or EKS clusters.

       This  request  creates  an  empty network package container with an ID.
       Once you create a network package, you can upload the  network  package
       content using PutSolNetworkPackageContent .

OPTIONS
       --tags (map)
          A tag is a label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services resource.
          Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You can  use  tags
          to  search  and  filter your resources or track your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices costs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          Network package ARN.

       id -> (string)
          ID of the network package.

       nsdOnboardingState -> (string)
          Onboarding  state  of  the network service descriptor in the network
          package.

       nsdOperationalState -> (string)
          Operational state of the network service descriptor in  the  network
          package.

       nsdUsageState -> (string)
          Usage  state  of the network service descriptor in the network pack-
          age.

       tags -> (map)
          A tag is a label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services resource.
          Each  tag  consists of a key and an optional value. You can use tags
