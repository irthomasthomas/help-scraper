DESCRIBE-CONFIGURATION-SETS()                    DESCRIBE-CONFIGURATION-SETS()



NAME
       describe-configuration-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified configuration sets or all in your account.

       If you specify configuration set names, the output includes information
       for only the specified configuration sets. If you specify filters,  the
       output includes information for only those configuration sets that meet
       the filter criteria. If you don't specify configuration  set  names  or
       filters, the output includes information for all configuration sets.

       If  you  specify a configuration set name that isn't valid, an error is
       returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-configuration-sets is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: ConfigurationSets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-configuration-sets
          [--configuration-set-names <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-names (list)
          An  array of strings. Each element can be either a ConfigurationSet-
          Name or ConfigurationSetArn.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of filters to apply to the results that are returned.

          (structure)
              The information for configuration sets  that  meet  a  specified
              criteria.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute to filter on.

              Values -> (list)
                 An array values to filter for.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "event-destination-name"|"matching-event-types"|"default-message-type"|"default-sender-id",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
