NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing configuration set.

       A  configuration  set is a set of rules that you apply to voice and SMS
       messages that you send. In a configuration set, you can specify a  des-
       tination  for  specific  types  of events related to voice and SMS mes-
       sages.

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set or the configuration set ARN  that
          you want to delete. The ConfigurationSetName and ConfigurationSetArn
          can be found using the  DescribeConfigurationSets action.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

                     The name of the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you want
                     to record events in.

                 An object that contains information about an  event  destina-
                 tion for logging to Amazon Data Firehose.

                 IamRoleArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of an Identity and Access Management role that is
