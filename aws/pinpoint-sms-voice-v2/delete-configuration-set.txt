DELETE-CONFIGURATION-SET()                          DELETE-CONFIGURATION-SET()



NAME
       delete-configuration-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing configuration set.

       A  configuration  set is a set of rules that you apply to voice and SMS
       messages that you send. In a configuration set, you can specify a  des-
       tination  for  specific  types  of events related to voice and SMS mes-
       sages.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-configuration-set
          --configuration-set-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set or the configuration set ARN  that
          you want to delete. The ConfigurationSetName and ConfigurationSetArn
          can be found using the  DescribeConfigurationSets action.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              CloudWatchLogsDestination -> (structure)
                 An object that contains information about an  event  destina-
                 tion that sends logging events to Amazon CloudWatch logs.

                 IamRoleArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Identity and

                     data to an Amazon CloudWatch destination.

                 LogGroupArn -> (string)
                     The name of the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you want
                     to record events in.

              KinesisFirehoseDestination -> (structure)
                 An object that contains information about an  event  destina-
                 tion for logging to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

                 IamRoleArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of an Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM)
                     role that is able to write event data to an Amazon  Fire-
                     hose destination.

                 DeliveryStreamArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the delivery stream.

              SnsDestination -> (structure)
                 An  object  that contains information about an event destina-
                 tion that sends logging events to Amazon SNS.

                 TopicArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Amazon  SNS  topic
                     that you want to publish events to.

       DefaultMessageType -> (string)
          The default message type of the configuration set that was deleted.

       DefaultSenderId -> (string)
          The default Sender ID of the configuration set that was deleted.
