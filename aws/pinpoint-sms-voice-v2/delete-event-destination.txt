DELETE-EVENT-DESTINATION()                          DELETE-EVENT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       delete-event-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing event destination.

       An  event destination is a location where you send response information
       about the messages that you send. For example, when a message is deliv-
       ered successfully, you can send information about that event to an Ama-
       zon CloudWatch destination, or send notifications to endpoints that are
       subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-event-destination
          --configuration-set-name <value>
          --event-destination-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The  name of the configuration set or the configuration set's Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN) to remove the event destination from.  The  Con-
          figurateSetName  and ConfigurationSetArn can be found using the  De-
          scribeConfigurationSets action.

       --event-destination-name (string)
          The name of the event destination to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
