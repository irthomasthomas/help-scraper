DELETE-EVENT-DESTINATION()                          DELETE-EVENT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       delete-event-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing event destination.

       An  event destination is a location where you send response information
       about the messages that you send. For example, when a message is deliv-
       ered successfully, you can send information about that event to an Ama-
       zon CloudWatch destination, or send notifications to endpoints that are
       subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The  name of the configuration set or the configuration set's Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN) to remove the event destination from.  The  Con-
          figurateSetName  and ConfigurationSetArn can be found using the  De-
          scribeConfigurationSets action.

       --event-destination-name (string)
          The name of the event destination to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.
