OPTIONS
       --attachment-body (blob)
          The registration file to upload. The maximum file size is  1MiB  and
          valid file extensions are PDF, JPEG and PNG.

       --attachment-url (string)
          A  URL  to the required registration file. For example, you can pro-
          vide the S3 object URL.

       --tags (list)
          An array of tags (key and value pairs) to associate with the  regis-
          tration attachment.

          (structure)
              The list of tags to be added to the specified topic.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value associated with the key of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If you don't specify a client  token,  a
          randomly  generated  token is used for the request to ensure idempo-
          tency.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
