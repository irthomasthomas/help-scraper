OPTIONS
       --phone-number-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of  the phone number. Valid values for this
          field can be either the PhoneNumberId or PhoneNumberArn.

       --two-way-enabled | --no-two-way-enabled (boolean)
          By default this is set to false. When set to true  you  can  receive
          incoming text messages from your end recipients.

       --two-way-channel-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the two way channel.

       --two-way-channel-role (string)
          An optional IAM Role Arn for a service to assume, to be able to post
          inbound SMS messages.

       --self-managed-opt-outs-enabled  |   --no-self-managed-opt-outs-enabled
       (boolean)
          By  default this is set to false. When an end recipient sends a mes-
          sage that begins with HELP or STOP to one of your dedicated numbers,
          Amazon  Pinpoint  automatically  replies with a customizable message
          and adds the end recipient to  the  OptOutList.  When  set  to  true
          you're  responsible for responding to HELP and STOP requests. You're
          also responsible for tracking and honoring opt-out requests.

       --opt-out-list-name (string)
          The OptOutList to add the phone number to.  Valid  values  for  this
          field can be either the OutOutListName or OutOutListArn.

       --deletion-protection-enabled | --no-deletion-protection-enabled (bool-
       ean)

          can't be deleted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
