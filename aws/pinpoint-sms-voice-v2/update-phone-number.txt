SYNOPSIS
            update-phone-number
          --phone-number-id <value>
          [--two-way-enabled | --no-two-way-enabled]
          [--two-way-channel-arn <value>]
          [--self-managed-opt-outs-enabled | --no-self-managed-opt-outs-enabled]
          [--opt-out-list-name <value>]
          [--deletion-protection-enabled | --no-deletion-protection-enabled]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --phone-number-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of  the phone number. Valid values for this
          field can be either the PhoneNumberId or PhoneNumberArn.

       --two-way-enabled | --no-two-way-enabled (boolean)
          By default this is set to false. When set to true  you  can  receive
          incoming text messages from your end recipients.

       --two-way-channel-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the two way channel.

       --self-managed-opt-outs-enabled   |  --no-self-managed-opt-outs-enabled
       (boolean)
          By default this is set to false. When an end recipient sends a  mes-
          sage that begins with HELP or STOP to one of your dedicated numbers,
          Amazon Pinpoint automatically replies with  a  customizable  message
          and  adds  the  end  recipient  to  the OptOutList. When set to true
          you're responsible for responding to HELP and STOP requests.  You're
          also responsible for tracking and honoring opt-out requests.

       --opt-out-list-name (string)
          The  OptOutList  to  add  the phone number to. Valid values for this
          field can be either the OutOutListName or OutOutListArn.

       --deletion-protection-enabled | --no-deletion-protection-enabled (bool-
       ean)
          By  default  this is set to false. When set to true the phone number
          can't be deleted.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
