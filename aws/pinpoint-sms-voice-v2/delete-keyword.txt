DELETE-KEYWORD()                                              DELETE-KEYWORD()



NAME
       delete-keyword -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing keyword from an origination phone number or pool.

       A  keyword is a word that you can search for on a particular phone num-
       ber or pool. It is also a specific word or phrase that an end user  can
       send to your number to elicit a response, such as an informational mes-
       sage or a special offer. When your number receives a message  that  be-
       gins with a keyword, AWS End User Messaging SMS and Voice responds with
       a customizable message.

       Keywords "HELP" and "STOP" can't be deleted or modified.

OPTIONS
       --origination-identity (string)
          The origination identity to use such as a  PhoneNumberId,  PhoneNum-
          berArn, PoolId or PoolArn. You can use  DescribePhoneNumbers to find
          the values for PhoneNumberId and PhoneNumberArn  and   DescribePools
          to find the values of PoolId and PoolArn.

          WARNING:
              If  you  are using a shared AWS End User Messaging SMS and Voice
              resource then you must use the full Amazon Resource Name(ARN).

       --keyword (string)
          The keyword to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
