DELETE-KEYWORD()                                              DELETE-KEYWORD()



NAME
       delete-keyword -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing keyword from an origination phone number or pool.

       A  keyword is a word that you can search for on a particular phone num-
       ber or pool. It is also a specific word or phrase that an end user  can
       send to your number to elicit a response, such as an informational mes-
       sage or a special offer. When your number receives a message  that  be-
       gins  with a keyword, Amazon Pinpoint responds with a customizable mes-
       sage.

       Keywords "HELP" and "STOP" can't be deleted or modified.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-keyword
          --origination-identity <value>
          --keyword <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --origination-identity (string)
          The origination identity to use such as a  PhoneNumberId,  PhoneNum-
          berArn, PoolId or PoolArn. You can use  DescribePhoneNumbers to find
          the values for PhoneNumberId and PhoneNumberArn  and   DescribePools
          to find the values of PoolId and PoolArn.

       --keyword (string)
          The keyword to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
