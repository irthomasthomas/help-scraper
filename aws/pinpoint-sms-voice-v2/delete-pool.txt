DELETE-POOL()                                                    DELETE-POOL()



NAME
       delete-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing pool. Deleting a pool disassociates all origination
       identities from that pool.

       If the pool status isn't active or if deletion protection  is  enabled,
       an Error is returned.

       A  pool  is a collection of phone numbers and SenderIds. A pool can in-
       clude one or more phone numbers and SenderIds that are associated  with
       your Amazon Web Services account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-pool
          --pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pool-id (string)
          The  PoolId  or  PoolArn  of  the  pool  to delete. You can use  De-
          scribePools to find the values for PoolId and PoolArn .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PoolArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pool that was deleted.

       PoolId -> (string)
          The PoolId of the pool that was deleted.

       Status -> (string)
          The current status of the pool.

          o CREATING: The pool is currently being created and isn't yet avail-
            able for use.

          o ACTIVE: The pool is active and available for use.

          o DELETING: The pool is being deleted.

       MessageType -> (string)
          The message type that was associated with the deleted pool.

       TwoWayEnabled -> (boolean)
          By default this is set to false. When set to true  you  can  receive
          incoming text messages from your end recipients.

       TwoWayChannelArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the TwoWayChannel.

       SelfManagedOptOutsEnabled -> (boolean)
          By  default this is set to false. When an end recipient sends a mes-
          sage that begins with HELP or STOP to one of your dedicated numbers,
          Amazon  Pinpoint  automatically  replies with a customizable message
          and adds the end recipient to  the  OptOutList.  When  set  to  true
          you're  responsible for responding to HELP and STOP requests. You're
          also responsible for tracking and honoring opt-out requests.

       OptOutListName -> (string)
          The name of the OptOutList that  was  associated  with  the  deleted
          pool.

       CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The time when the pool was created, in UNIX epoch time format.
