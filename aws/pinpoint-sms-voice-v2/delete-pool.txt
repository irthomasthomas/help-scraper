DELETE-POOL()                                                    DELETE-POOL()



NAME
       delete-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing pool. Deleting a pool disassociates all origination
       identities from that pool.

       If the pool status isn't active or if deletion protection  is  enabled,
       an Error is returned.

       A  pool  is a collection of phone numbers and SenderIds. A pool can in-
       clude one or more phone numbers and SenderIds that are associated  with
       your Amazon Web Services account.

OPTIONS
       --pool-id (string)
          The  PoolId  or  PoolArn  of  the  pool  to delete. You can use  De-
          scribePools to find the values for PoolId and PoolArn .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

          The PoolId of the pool that was deleted.

       Status -> (string)
          The current status of the pool.

          o CREATING: The pool is currently being created and isn't yet avail-
            able for use.
