DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-ATTRIBUTES()                    DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       describe-account-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes attributes of your Amazon Web Services account. The supported
       account attributes include account tier, which indicates  whether  your
       account  is in the sandbox or production environment. When you're ready
       to move your account out of the sandbox, create an Amazon Web  Services
       Support case for a service limit increase request.

       New  Amazon  Pinpoint accounts are placed into an SMS or voice sandbox.
       The sandbox protects both Amazon Web Services end recipients and SMS or
       voice recipients from fraud and abuse.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-account-attributes  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: AccountAttributes

SYNOPSIS
            describe-account-attributes
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AccountAttributes -> (list)
          An array of AccountAttributes objects.

          (structure)
              Displays the attributes associated with a single Amazon Web Ser-
              vices account.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the account attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value associated with the account attribute name.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token to be used for the next set of paginated results. If this
          field is empty then there are no more results.
