DESCRIBE-POOLS()                                              DESCRIBE-POOLS()



NAME
       describe-pools -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the specified pools or all pools associated with your Amazon
       Web Services account.

       If you specify pool IDs, the output includes information for  only  the
       specified  pools.  If you specify filters, the output includes informa-
       tion for only those pools that meet the filter criteria. If  you  don't
       specify  pool  IDs  or filters, the output includes information for all
       pools.

       If you specify a pool ID that isn't valid, an error is returned.

       A pool is a collection of phone numbers and SenderIds. A pool  can  in-
       clude  one or more phone numbers and SenderIds that are associated with
       your Amazon Web Services account.

       describe-pools is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Pools

OPTIONS
       --pool-ids (list)
          The  unique identifier of pools to find. This is an array of strings
          that can be either the PoolId or PoolArn.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of PoolFilter objects to filter the results.

          (structure)
              The information for a pool that meets a specified criteria.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute to filter on.

              Values -> (list)
                 An array values to filter for.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "status"|"message-type"|"two-way-enabled"|"self-managed-opt-outs-enabled"|"opt-out-list-name"|"shared-routes-enabled"|"deletion-protection-enabled"|"two-way-channel-arn",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

                 messages that aren't critical or time-sensitive.

              TwoWayEnabled -> (boolean)
                 When  set to true you can receive incoming text messages from

                 gins with HELP or STOP to one of your dedicated numbers, Ama-
                 zon  Pinpoint  automatically replies with a customizable mes-
                 sage and adds the end recipient to the OptOutList.  When  set
                 to  true  you're  responsible for responding to HELP and STOP
                 requests. You're also responsible for tracking  and  honoring

                 IDs (depending on the country) that  are  shared  with  other
                 Amazon  Pinpoint users. In some countries, such as the United
                 States, senders aren't allowed to use shared routes and  must
                 use a dedicated phone number or short code.

                 When set to true the pool can't be deleted.

              CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when the pool was created, in UNIX epoch time for-
                 mat.
