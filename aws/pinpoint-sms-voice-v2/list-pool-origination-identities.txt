LIST-POOL-ORIGINATION-IDENTITIES()          LIST-POOL-ORIGINATION-IDENTITIES()



NAME
       list-pool-origination-identities -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all associated origination identities in your pool.

       If  you specify filters, the output includes information for only those
       origination identities that meet the filter criteria.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-pool-origination-identities is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: OriginationIdentities

SYNOPSIS
            list-pool-origination-identities
          --pool-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pool-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  for  the pool. This value can be either the
          PoolId or PoolArn.

       --filters (list)
          An array of PoolOriginationIdentitiesFilter objects  to  filter  the
          results..

          (structure)
              Information  about origination identities associated with a pool
              that meets a specified criteria.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute to filter on.

              Values -> (list)
                 An array values to filter for.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "iso-country-code"|"number-capability",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PoolArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the pool.

       PoolId -> (string)
          The unique PoolId of the pool.

       OriginationIdentities -> (list)
          An array of any OriginationIdentityMetadata objects.

          (structure)
              The metadata for an origination identity associated with a pool.

              OriginationIdentityArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with  the  origina-
                 tion identity.

              OriginationIdentity -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the origination identity.

              IsoCountryCode -> (string)
                 The two-character code, in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format, for the
                 country or region.

              NumberCapabilities -> (list)
                 Describes if the origination identity can be  used  for  text
                 messages, voice calls or both.

                 (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token to be used for the next set of paginated results. If this
          field is empty then there are no more results.
