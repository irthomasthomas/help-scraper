PUT-KEYWORD()                                                    PUT-KEYWORD()



NAME
       put-keyword -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates a keyword configuration on an origination phone num-
       ber or pool.

       A keyword is a word that you can search for on a particular phone  num-
       ber  or pool. It is also a specific word or phrase that an end user can
       send to your number to elicit a response, such as an informational mes-
       sage  or  a special offer. When your number receives a message that be-
       gins with a keyword, Amazon Pinpoint responds with a customizable  mes-
       sage.

       If you specify a keyword that isn't valid, an error is returned.

          berArn, SenderId or SenderIdArn. You can  use   DescribePhoneNumbers
          get  the  values  for  PhoneNumberId  and  PhoneNumberArn while  De-
          scribeSenderIds can be used to  get  the  values  for  SenderId  and
          SenderIdArn.

       --keyword (string)
          The new keyword to add.

       --keyword-message (string)
          The message associated with the keyword.

       --keyword-action (string)

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
