DESCRIBE-SPEND-LIMITS()                                DESCRIBE-SPEND-LIMITS()



NAME
       describe-spend-limits -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  current monthly spend limits for sending voice and text
       messages.

       When you establish an Amazon Web Services account, the account has ini-
       tial monthly spend limit in a given Region. For more information on in-
       creasing your monthly spend limit, see  Requesting  increases  to  your
       monthly SMS, MMS, or Voice spending quota in the AWS End User Messaging
       SMS User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-spend-limits is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: SpendLimits

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SpendLimits -> (list)
          An  array of SpendLimit objects that contain the details for the re-
          quested spend limits.

          (structure)
              Describes the current monthly spend limits for sending voice and
              text  messages.  For more information on increasing your monthly
              spend limit, see Requesting a spending quota increase in the AWS

              Name -> (string)

              EnforcedLimit -> (long)
                 The  maximum amount of money, in US dollars, that you want to
                 be able to spend sending messages each month. This value  has
                 to  be  less than or equal to the amount in MaxLimit . To use
                 this custom limit, Overridden must be set to true.

              MaxLimit -> (long)
                 The maximum amount of money that you are  able  to  spend  to

                 dollars.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to be used for the next set of paginated results. If  this
