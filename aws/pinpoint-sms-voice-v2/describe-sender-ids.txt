DESCRIBE-SENDER-IDS()                                    DESCRIBE-SENDER-IDS()



NAME
       describe-sender-ids -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified SenderIds or all SenderIds associated with your
       Amazon Web Services account.

       If you specify SenderIds, the output includes information for only  the
       specified SenderIds. If you specify filters, the output includes infor-
       mation for only those SenderIds that meet the filter criteria.  If  you
       don't specify SenderIds or filters, the output includes information for
       all SenderIds.

       f you specify a sender ID that isn't valid, an error is returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-sender-ids is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: SenderIds

OPTIONS
       --sender-ids (list)
          An array of SenderIdAndCountry objects to search for.

          (structure)
              The  alphanumeric  sender ID in a specific country that you want
              to describe. For more information on sender IDs  see  Requesting
              sender IDs in the AWS End User Messaging SMS User Guide .

              SenderId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the sender.

              IsoCountryCode -> (string)
                 The two-character code, in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format, for the
                 country or region.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SenderId=string,IsoCountryCode=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SenderId": "string",
              "IsoCountryCode": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filters (list)
          An array of SenderIdFilter objects to filter the results.

          (structure)
              The information for a sender ID that meets a specified criteria.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute to filter on.

              Values -> (list)
                 An array of values to filter for.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "sender-id"|"iso-country-code"|"message-type"|"deletion-protection-enabled"|"registered",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
