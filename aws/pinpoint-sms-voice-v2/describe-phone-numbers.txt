DESCRIBE-PHONE-NUMBERS()                              DESCRIBE-PHONE-NUMBERS()



NAME
       describe-phone-numbers -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified origination phone number, or all the phone num-
       bers in your account.

       If you specify phone number IDs, the output  includes  information  for
       only  the  specified  phone numbers. If you specify filters, the output
       includes information for only those phone numbers that meet the  filter
       criteria.  If you don't specify phone number IDs or filters, the output
       includes information for all phone numbers.

       If you specify a phone number ID that isn't  valid,  an  Error  is  re-
       turned.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-phone-numbers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PhoneNumbers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-phone-numbers
          [--phone-number-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --phone-number-ids (list)
          The unique identifier of phone numbers to  find  information  about.
          This  is an array of strings that can be either the PhoneNumberId or
          PhoneNumberArn.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of PhoneNumberFilter objects to filter the results.

          (structure)
              The information for a phone number that meets a specified crite-
              ria.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute to filter on.

              Values -> (list)
                 An array values to filter for.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "status"|"iso-country-code"|"message-type"|"number-capability"|"number-type"|"two-way-enabled"|"self-managed-opt-outs-enabled"|"opt-out-list-name"|"deletion-protection-enabled",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
