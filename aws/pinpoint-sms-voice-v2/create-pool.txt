CREATE-POOL()                                                    CREATE-POOL()



NAME
       create-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new pool and associates the specified origination identity to
       the pool. A pool can include one or more phone  numbers  and  SenderIds
       that are associated with your Amazon Web Services account.

       The  new pool inherits its configuration from the specified origination
       identity. This includes keywords, message type, opt-out  list,  two-way
       configuration, and self-managed opt-out configuration. Deletion protec-
       tion isn't inherited from the  origination  identity  and  defaults  to
       false.

       If the origination identity is a phone number and is already associated
       with another pool, an Error is returned. A sender ID can be  associated
       with multiple pools.

SYNOPSIS
            create-pool
          --origination-identity <value>
          --iso-country-code <value>
          --message-type <value>
          [--deletion-protection-enabled | --no-deletion-protection-enabled]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --origination-identity (string)
          The  origination  identity to use such as a PhoneNumberId, PhoneNum-
          berArn, SenderId or SenderIdArn. You can  use   DescribePhoneNumbers
          to  find  the values for PhoneNumberId and PhoneNumberArn while  De-
          scribeSenderIds can be used to  get  the  values  for  SenderId  and
          SenderIdArn.

       --iso-country-code (string)
          The  new  two-character  code, in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format, for the
          country or region of the new pool.

       --message-type (string)
          The type of message. Valid values  are  TRANSACTIONAL  for  messages
          that  are  critical  or  time-sensitive and PROMOTIONAL for messages
          that aren't critical or time-sensitive.

          Possible values:

          o TRANSACTIONAL

          o PROMOTIONAL

       --deletion-protection-enabled | --no-deletion-protection-enabled (bool-
       ean)
          By  default this is set to false. When set to true the pool can't be
          deleted. You can change this value using the  UpdatePool action.

       --tags (list)
          An array of tags (key and value pairs) associated with the pool.

          (structure)
              The list of tags to be added to the specified topic.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value associated with the key of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of  the request. If you don't specify a client token, a
          randomly generated token is used for the request to  ensure  idempo-
          tency.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PoolArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the pool.

       PoolId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the pool.

       Status -> (string)
          The current status of the pool.

          o CREATING: The pool is currently being created and isn't yet avail-
            able for use.

          o ACTIVE: The pool is active and available for use.

          o DELETING: The pool is being deleted.

       MessageType -> (string)
          The type of message for the pool to use.

       TwoWayEnabled -> (boolean)
          By  default  this  is set to false. When set to true you can receive
          incoming text messages from your end recipients.

       TwoWayChannelArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the two way channel.

       SelfManagedOptOutsEnabled -> (boolean)
          By default this is set to false. When an end recipient sends a  mes-
          sage that begins with HELP or STOP to one of your dedicated numbers,
          Amazon Pinpoint automatically replies with  a  customizable  message
          and  adds  the  end  recipient  to  the OptOutList. When set to true
          you're responsible for responding to HELP and STOP requests.  You're
          also responsible for tracking and honoring opt-out requests.

       OptOutListName -> (string)
          The name of the OptOutList associated with the pool.

       SharedRoutesEnabled -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether shared routes are enabled for the pool.

       DeletionProtectionEnabled -> (boolean)
          When  set to true deletion protection is enabled. By default this is
          set to false.

       Tags -> (list)
          An array of tags (key and value pairs) associated with the pool.

          (structure)
              The list of tags to be added to the specified topic.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value associated with the key of the tag.

       CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The time when the pool was created, in UNIX epoch time format.
