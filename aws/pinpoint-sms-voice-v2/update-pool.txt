OPTIONS
       --pool-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the pool to update. Valid values are either
          the PoolId or PoolArn.

       --two-way-enabled | --no-two-way-enabled (boolean)
          By  default  this  is set to false. When set to true you can receive
          incoming text messages from your end recipients.

       --two-way-channel-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the two way channel.

       --two-way-channel-role (string)
          An optional IAM Role Arn for a service to assume, to be able to post
          inbound SMS messages.

       --self-managed-opt-outs-enabled   |  --no-self-managed-opt-outs-enabled
       (boolean)
          By default this is set to false. When an end recipient sends a  mes-
          sage that begins with HELP or STOP to one of your dedicated numbers,
          AWS End User Messaging SMS and Voice automatically  replies  with  a
          customizable  message  and adds the end recipient to the OptOutList.
          When set to true you're responsible for responding to HELP and  STOP
          requests.  You're also responsible for tracking and honoring opt-out
          requests.

       --opt-out-list-name (string)
          The OptOutList to associate with the pool. Valid values  are  either
          OptOutListName or OptOutListArn.

       --shared-routes-enabled | --no-shared-routes-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates whether shared routes are enabled for the pool.

       --deletion-protection-enabled | --no-deletion-protection-enabled (bool-
       ean)
          When set to true the pool can't be deleted.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
