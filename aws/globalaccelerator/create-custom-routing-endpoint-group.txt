CREATE-CUSTOM-ROUTING-ENDPOINT-GROUP()  CREATE-CUSTOM-ROUTING-ENDPOINT-GROUP()



NAME
       create-custom-routing-endpoint-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an endpoint group for the specified listener for a custom rout-
       ing accelerator. An endpoint group is a collection of endpoints in  one
       Amazon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-custom-routing-endpoint-group
          --listener-arn <value>
          --endpoint-group-region <value>
          --destination-configurations <value>
          [--idempotency-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener for a custom routing
          endpoint.

       --endpoint-group-region (string)
          The Amazon Web Services Region where the endpoint group is  located.
          A listener can have only one endpoint group in a specific Region.

       --destination-configurations (list)
          Sets  the port range and protocol for all endpoints (virtual private
          cloud subnets) in a custom routing endpoint group to  accept  client
          traffic on.

          (structure)
              For a custom routing accelerator, sets the port range and proto-
              col for all endpoints (virtual private cloud subnets) in an end-
              point group to accept client traffic on.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 The first port, inclusive, in the range of ports for the end-
                 point group that is associated with a custom routing acceler-
                 ator.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 The  last port, inclusive, in the range of ports for the end-
                 point group that is associated with a custom routing acceler-
                 ator.

              Protocols -> (list)
                 The protocol for the endpoint group that is associated with a
                 custom routing accelerator. The protocol can be either TCP or
                 UDP.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer,Protocols=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FromPort": integer,
              "ToPort": integer,
              "Protocols": ["TCP"|"UDP", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotencythat is, the uniquenessof the request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an endpoint group for a custom routing accelerator

       The following create-custom-routing-endpoint-group example  creates  an
       endpoint group for a custom routing accelerator.

          aws globalaccelerator create-custom-routing-endpoint-group \
              --listener-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz \
              --endpoint-group-region us-east-2 \
              --destination-configurations "FromPort=80,ToPort=81,Protocols=TCP,UDP"

       Output:

          {
              "EndpointGroup": {
                  "EndpointGroupArn": "arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz/endpoint-group/4321abcd",
                  "EndpointGroupRegion": "us-east-2",

                          "FromPort": 80,
                          "ToPort": 81,

              }
          }
