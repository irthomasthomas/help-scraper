NAME
       delete-cross-account-attachment -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete  a  cross-account  attachment.  When  you  delete an attachment,
       Global Accelerator revokes the permission to use the resources  in  the
       attachment from all principals in the list of principals. Global Accel-
       erator revokes the permission for specific resources by doing the  fol-
       lowing:

       o If  the  principal is an account ID, Global Accelerator reviews every
         accelerator in the account and removes cross-account  endpoints  from
         all accelerators.

       o If  the  principal is an accelerator, Global Accelerator reviews just
         that accelerator and removes cross-account endpoints from it.

       If there are overlapping permissions provided by multiple cross-account
       attachments,  Global Accelerator only removes endpoints if there are no
       current cross-account attachments that provide access  permission.  For
       example,  if you delete a cross-account attachment that lists an accel-
       erator as a principal, but another  cross-account  attachment  includes
       the  account  ID  that owns that accelerator, endpoints will not be re-
       moved from the accelerator.

OPTIONS
       --attachment-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the cross-account  attachment  to
          delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       rides config/env settings.
