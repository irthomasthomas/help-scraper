REMOVE-ENDPOINTS()                                          REMOVE-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       remove-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Remove endpoints from an endpoint group.

       The  RemoveEndpoints API operation is the recommended option for remov-
       ing endpoints. The alternative is to remove endpoints  by  updating  an
       endpoint  group  by  using the UpdateEndpointGroup API operation. There
       are two advantages to using AddEndpoints to remove endpoints instead:

       o It's more convenient, because you only need to specify the  endpoints
         that  you want to remove. With the UpdateEndpointGroup API operation,
         you must specify all of the endpoints in the  endpoint  group  except
         the ones that you want to remove from the group.

       o It's  faster,  because Global Accelerator doesn't need to resolve any
         endpoints. With the UpdateEndpointGroup API operation, Global  Accel-
         erator must resolve all of the endpoints that remain in the group.

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-identifiers (list)
          The identifiers of the endpoints that you want to remove.

          (structure)
              A  complex type for an endpoint. Specifies information about the
              endpoint to remove from the endpoint group.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint  is  a  Network  Load
                 Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Re-
                 source Name (ARN) of the resource.  If  the  endpoint  is  an
                 Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation
                 ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID.

                 An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or inter-
                 net-facing.

              ClientIPPreservationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  client IP address preservation is enabled
                 for an endpoint. The value is true or false.

                 If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is  pre-
                 served in the X-Forwarded-For request header as traffic trav-
                 els to applications on the endpoint fronted by the  accelera-
                 tor.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EndpointId=string,ClientIPPreservationEnabled=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EndpointId": "string",
              "ClientIPPreservationEnabled": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --endpoint-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       None
