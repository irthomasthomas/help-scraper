UPDATE-CROSS-ACCOUNT-ATTACHMENT()            UPDATE-CROSS-ACCOUNT-ATTACHMENT()



NAME
       update-cross-account-attachment -

DESCRIPTION
       Update  a  cross-account  attachment to add or remove principals or re-
       sources. When you update an attachment to remove a  principal  (account
       ID  or  accelerator) or a resource, Global Accelerator revokes the per-
       mission for specific resources by doing the following:

       o If the principal is an account ID, Global Accelerator  reviews  every
         accelerator  in  the account and removes cross-account endpoints from
         all accelerators.

       o If the principal is an accelerator, Global Accelerator  reviews  just
         that accelerator and removes cross-account endpoints from it.

       If there are overlapping permissions provided by multiple cross-account
       attachments, Global Accelerator only removes endpoints if there are  no
       current  cross-account  attachments that provide access permission. For
       example, if you delete a cross-account attachment that lists an  accel-
       erator  as  a  principal, but another cross-account attachment includes
       the account ID that owns that accelerator, endpoints will  not  be  re-
       moved from the accelerator.

OPTIONS
       --attachment-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the cross-account attachment to
          update.

       --name (string)
          The name of the cross-account attachment.

       --add-principals (list)
          The principals to add to the cross-account attachment.  A  principal
          is  an  account  or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an accelerator
          that the attachment gives permission to add the resources  from  an-
          other account, listed in the attachment.

          To  add more than one principal, separate the account numbers or ac-
          celerator ARNs, or both, with commas.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --remove-principals (list)
          The principals to remove from the cross-account attachment. A  prin-
          cipal is an account or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an acceler-
          ator that is given permission to add the resources from another  ac-
          count, listed in the cross-account attachment.

          To  remove  more than one principal, separate the account numbers or
          accelerator ARNs, or both, with commas.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --add-resources (list)
          The resources to add to the  cross-account  attachment.  A  resource
          listed  in a cross-account attachment can be added to an accelerator
          by the principals that are listed in the attachment.

          To add more than one resource, separate the resource ARNs with  com-
          mas.

          (structure)

              celerator and can be added as an endpoint for an accelerator.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 The endpoint ID for the endpoint  (Amazon  Web  Services  re-
                 source).

              Region -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region where a resource is located.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EndpointId": "string",
              "Region": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --remove-resources (list)
          The  resources  to  remove  from the cross-account attachment. A re-
          source listed in a cross-account attachment can be added to  an  ac-
          celerator fy principals that are listed in the cross-account attach-
          ment.

          To remove more than one resource, separate the  resource  ARNs  with
          commas.

              An  Amazon Web Services resource that is supported by Global Ac-
              celerator and can be added as an endpoint for an accelerator.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 The endpoint ID for the endpoint  (Amazon  Web  Services  re-
                 source).

              Region -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region where a resource is located.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EndpointId=string,Region=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
