NAME
       update-cross-account-attachment -

DESCRIPTION
       Update  a  cross-account  attachment to add or remove principals or re-
       sources. When you update an attachment to remove a  principal  (account
       ID  or  accelerator) or a resource, Global Accelerator revokes the per-
       mission for specific resources.

       For more information, see Working with  cross-account  attachments  and
       resources  in  Global  Accelerator  in the Global Accelerator Developer
       Guide .

OPTIONS
       --attachment-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  cross-account  attachment  to
          update.

       --name (string)
          The name of the cross-account attachment.

       --add-principals (list)
          The  principals  to add to the cross-account attachment. A principal
          is an account or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  an  accelerator
          that the attachment gives permission to work with resources from an-
          other account. The resources are also listed in the attachment.

          To add more than one principal, separate the account numbers or  ac-
          celerator ARNs, or both, with commas.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --remove-principals (list)
          The  principals to remove from the cross-account attachment. A prin-
          cipal is an account or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an acceler-
          ator  that  the  attachment  gives permission to work with resources
          from another account. The resources are also listed in  the  attach-
          ment.

          To  remove  more than one principal, separate the account numbers or
          accelerator ARNs, or both, with commas.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --add-resources (list)
          The resources to add to the  cross-account  attachment.  A  resource
          listed in a cross-account attachment can be used with an accelerator
          by the principals that are listed in the attachment.

          To add more than one resource, separate the resource ARNs with  com-
          mas.

          (structure)
              A  resource  is  one of the following: the ARN for an Amazon Web
              Services resource that is supported by Global Accelerator to  be
              added  as  an  endpoint,  or a CIDR range that specifies a bring
              your own IP (BYOIP) address pool.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 The endpoint ID for the endpoint that is specified as a  Ama-
                 zon Web Services resource.

                 An endpoint ID for the cross-account feature is the ARN of an
                 Amazon Web Services resource, such as  a  Network  Load  Bal-
                 ancer, that Global Accelerator supports as an endpoint for an
                 accelerator.

              Cidr -> (string)
                 An IP address range, in CIDR format, that is specified as re-
                 source.  The  address  must  be provisioned and advertised in
                 Global Accelerator by following the bring your own IP address
                 (BYOIP) process for Global Accelerator

                 For more information, see Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
