ALLOW-CUSTOM-ROUTING-TRAFFIC()                  ALLOW-CUSTOM-ROUTING-TRAFFIC()



NAME
       allow-custom-routing-traffic -

DESCRIPTION
       Specify  the  Amazon  EC2 instance (destination) IP addresses and ports
       for a VPC subnet endpoint that can receive traffic for a custom routing
       accelerator.  You  can  allow traffic to all destinations in the subnet
       endpoint, or allow traffic to a specified list of  destination  IP  ad-
       dresses  and  ports  in the subnet. Note that you cannot specify IP ad-
       dresses or ports outside of the range that you configured for the  end-
       point group.

       After you make changes, you can verify that the updates are complete by
       checking the status  of  your  accelerator:  the  status  changes  from
       IN_PROGRESS to DEPLOYED.

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

       --endpoint-id (string)
          An ID for the endpoint. For custom routing accelerators, this is the
          virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet ID.

       --destination-addresses (list)
          A list of specific Amazon EC2 instance IP addresses (destination ad-
          dresses)  in a subnet that you want to allow to receive traffic. The
          IP addresses must be a subset of the IP addresses that you specified
          for the endpoint group.
              DestinationAddresses is required if AllowAllTrafficToEndpoint is
              FALSE or is not specified.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --destination-ports (list)
          A list of specific Amazon EC2  instance  ports  (destination  ports)
          that you want to allow to receive traffic.

          (integer)

       Syntax:

          integer integer ...

       --allow-all-traffic-to-endpoint   |  --no-allow-all-traffic-to-endpoint
       (boolean)
          Indicates whether all destination IP addresses and ports for a spec-
          ified  VPC subnet endpoint can receive traffic from a custom routing
          accelerator. The value is TRUE or FALSE.

          When set to TRUE, all destinations in the custom routing VPC  subnet
          can receive traffic. Note that you cannot specify destination IP ad-
          dresses and ports when the value is set to TRUE.

          When set to FALSE (or not specified), you must  specify  a  list  of
          destination IP addresses that are allowed to receive traffic. A list
          of ports is optional. If you don't specify  a  list  of  ports,  the
          ports  that  can  accept traffic is the same as the ports configured
          for the endpoint group.

          The default value is FALSE.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To allow traffic to specific Amazon EC2 instance destinations in a  VPC
       subnet for a custom routing accelerator

       The following allow-custom-routing-traffic example specifies that traf-
       fic is allowed to certain Amazon  EC2  instance  (destination)  IP  ad-
       dresses  and ports for a VPC subnet endpoint in a custom routing accel-
       erator can receive traffic.

          aws globalaccelerator allow-custom-routing-traffic \
              --endpoint-group-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz/endpoint-group/ab88888example \
              --endpoint-id subnet-abcd123example \
              --destination-addresses "172.31.200.6" "172.31.200.7" \
              --destination-ports 80 81

       This command produces no output.
