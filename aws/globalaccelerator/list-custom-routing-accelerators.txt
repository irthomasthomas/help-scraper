NAME
       list-custom-routing-accelerators -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  custom  routing  accelerators for an Amazon Web Services ac-
       count.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-custom-routing-accelerators is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: Accelerators

SYNOPSIS
            list-custom-routing-accelerators
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]

          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Accelerators -> (list)
          The list of custom routing accelerators for a customer account.

          (structure)
              Attributes of a custom routing accelerator.

              AcceleratorArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom routing acceler-
                 ator.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the accelerator. The name must contain  only  al-
                 phanumeric  characters  or hyphens (-), and must not begin or
                 end with a hyphen.

              IpAddressType -> (string)
                 The IP address type that an accelerator supports. For a  cus-
                 tom routing accelerator, the value must be IPV4.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  accelerator is enabled. The value is
                 true or false. The default value is true.

                 If the value is  set  to  true,  the  accelerator  cannot  be
                 deleted. If set to false, accelerator can be deleted.

              IpSets -> (list)
                 The  static  IP  addresses that Global Accelerator associates
                 with the accelerator.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type for the set of IP addresses for an  accel-
                     erator.

                     IpFamily -> (string)
                        IpFamily  is deprecated and has been replaced by IpAd-
                        dressFamily.

                     IpAddresses -> (list)
                        The array of IP addresses in the IP address set. An IP
                        address set can have a maximum of two IP addresses.

                        (string)

                     IpAddressFamily -> (string)
                        The types of IP addresses included in this IP set.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The  Domain  Name  System  (DNS) name that Global Accelerator
                 creates that points  to  an  accelerator's  static  IPv4  ad-
                 dresses.

                 The  naming  convention  for the DNS name is the following: A
                 lowercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random  hex  string,
                 followed    by    .awsglobalaccelerator.com.   For   example:
                 a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

                 If you have a dual-stack accelerator, you also have a  second
                 DNS name, DualStackDnsName , that points to both the A record
                 and the AAAA record for all four static addresses for the ac-
                 celerator: two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

                 For  more information about the default DNS name, see Support
                 for DNS addressing in Global Accelerator in the Global Accel-
                 erator Developer Guide .

              Status -> (string)
                 Describes the deployment status of the accelerator.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the accelerator was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the accelerator was last modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
