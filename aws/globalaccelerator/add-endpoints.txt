ADD-ENDPOINTS()                                                ADD-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       add-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Add  endpoints  to an endpoint group. The AddEndpoints API operation is
       the recommended option for adding endpoints.  The  alternative  options
       are  to  add  endpoints  when  you  create  an endpoint group (with the
       CreateEndpointGroup API) or when you update an endpoint group (with the
       UpdateEndpointGroup API).

       There  are  two  advantages  to  using AddEndpoints to add endpoints in
       Global Accelerator:

       o It's faster, because Global Accelerator only has to resolve  the  new
         endpoints  that you're adding, rather than resolving new and existing
         endpoints.

       o It's more convenient, because you don't need to specify  the  current
         endpoints  that are already in the endpoint group, in addition to the
         new endpoints that you want to add.

       For information about endpoint types  and  requirements  for  endpoints
       that  you can add to Global Accelerator, see Endpoints for standard ac-
       celerators in the Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-configurations (list)
          The list of endpoint objects.

          (structure)
              A complex type for endpoints. A resource must be valid  and  ac-
              tive when you add it as an endpoint.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 An  ID  for  the  endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load
                 Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Re-
                 source  Name  (ARN)  of  the  resource. If the endpoint is an
                 Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation
                 ID.  For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID. A
                 resource must be valid and active when you add it as an  end-
                 point.

                 An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or inter-
                 net-facing.

              Weight -> (integer)
                 The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights
                 to endpoints, you configure Global Accelerator to route traf-
                 fic based on proportions that you specify. For  example,  you
                 might  specify  endpoint  weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20).
                 The result is that 4/20  of  your  traffic,  on  average,  is
                 routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the sec-
                 ond and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last  end-
                 point.  For  more  information,  see  Endpoint weights in the
                 Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

              ClientIPPreservationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether client IP address preservation  is  enabled
                 for  an  endpoint.  The  value  is true or false. The default
                 value is true for Application Load Balancer endpoints.

                 If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is  pre-
                 served in the X-Forwarded-For request header as traffic trav-
                 els to applications on the endpoint fronted by the  accelera-
                 tor.

                 Client IP address preservation is supported, in specific Ama-
                 zon Web Services Regions, for endpoints that are  Application
                 Load  Balancers,  Amazon EC2 instances, and Network Load Bal-
                 ancers with security groups. IMPORTANT: You cannot use client
                 IP  address preservation with Network Load Balancers with TLS
                 listeners.

                 For more information, see Preserve  client  IP  addresses  in
                 Global  Accelerator in the Global Accelerator Developer Guide
                 .

              AttachmentArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  cross-account  attach-
                 ment  that  specifies  the  endpoints (resources) that can be
                 added to accelerators and principals that have permission  to
                 add the endpoints to accelerators.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EndpointId=string,Weight=integer,ClientIPPreservationEnabled=boolean,AttachmentArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EndpointId": "string",
              "Weight": integer,
              "ClientIPPreservationEnabled": true|false,
              "AttachmentArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --endpoint-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EndpointDescriptions -> (list)
          The list of endpoint objects.

          (structure)
              A complex type for an endpoint. Each endpoint group can  include
              one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 An  ID  for  the  endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load
                 Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Re-
                 source  Name  (ARN)  of  the  resource. If the endpoint is an
                 Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation
                 ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID.

                 An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or inter-
                 net-facing.

              Weight -> (integer)
                 The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights
                 to endpoints, you configure Global Accelerator to route traf-
                 fic based on proportions that you specify. For  example,  you
                 might  specify  endpoint  weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20).
                 The result is that 4/20  of  your  traffic,  on  average,  is
                 routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the sec-
                 ond and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last  end-
                 point.  For  more  information,  see  Endpoint weights in the
                 Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

              HealthState -> (string)
                 The health status of the endpoint.

              HealthReason -> (string)
                 Returns a null result.

              ClientIPPreservationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether client IP address preservation  is  enabled
                 for  an  endpoint.  The  value  is true or false. The default
                 value is true for Application Load Balancers endpoints.

                 If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is  pre-
                 served in the X-Forwarded-For request header as traffic trav-
                 els to applications on the endpoint fronted by the  accelera-
                 tor.
