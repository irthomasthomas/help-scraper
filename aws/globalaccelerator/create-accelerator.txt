CREATE-ACCELERATOR()                                      CREATE-ACCELERATOR()



NAME
       create-accelerator -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an  accelerator.  An accelerator includes one or more listeners
       that process inbound connections and direct traffic to one or more end-
       point  groups,  each  of which includes endpoints, such as Network Load
       Balancers.

       WARNING:
          Global Accelerator is a global service that  supports  endpoints  in
          multiple  Amazon  Web  Services  Regions but you must specify the US
          West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work  with  ac-
          celerators. That is, for example, specify --region us-west-2 on Ama-
          zon Web Services CLI commands.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the accelerator. The name can have a maximum of 64 char-
          acters,  must  contain only alphanumeric characters, periods (.), or
          hyphens (-), and must not begin or end with a hyphen or period.

       --ip-address-type (string)
          The IP address type that an accelerator supports. For a standard ac-
          celerator, the value can be IPV4 or DUAL_STACK.

          Possible values:

          o IPV4

          o DUAL_STACK

       --ip-addresses (list)
          Optionally,  if  you've added your own IP address pool to Global Ac-
          celerator (BYOIP), you can choose an IPv4 address from your own pool
          to  use for the accelerator's static IPv4 address when you create an
          accelerator.

          After you bring an address range to Amazon Web Services, it  appears
          in  your account as an address pool. When you create an accelerator,
          you can assign one IPv4 address from your range to it. Global Accel-
          erator  assigns  you  a second static IPv4 address from an Amazon IP
          address range. If you bring two IPv4 address ranges  to  Amazon  Web
          Services,  you  can  assign one IPv4 address from each range to your
          accelerator. This restriction is because Global Accelerator  assigns
          each  address range to a different network zone, for high availabil-
          ity.

          You can specify one or two addresses, separated by a space.  Do  not
          include the /32 suffix.

          Note that you can't update IP addresses for an existing accelerator.
          To change them, you must create a new accelerator with the  new  ad-
          dresses.

          For more information, see Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in the
          Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates whether an accelerator is enabled. The value  is  true  or
          false. The default value is true.

          If  the  value  is set to true, an accelerator cannot be deleted. If
          set to false, the accelerator can be deleted.

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotencythat is, the uniquenessof an accelerator.

       --tags (list)
          Create tags for an accelerator.

          For  more  information,  see  Tagging  in  Global Accelerator in the
          Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains a Tag key and Tag value.

              Key -> (string)
                 A string that contains a Tag key.

              Value -> (string)
                 A string that contains a Tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an accelerator

       The following create-accelerator example creates  an  accelerator  with
       two  tags  with  two  BYOIP  static  IP addresses. You must specify the
       US-West-2 (Oregon) Region to create or update an accelerator.

          aws globalaccelerator create-accelerator \
              --name ExampleAccelerator \
              --tags Key="Name",Value="Example Name" Key="Project",Value="Example Project" \
              --ip-addresses 192.0.2.250 198.51.100.52

       Output:

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the accelerator.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the accelerator. The name must contain only alphanu-
              meric  characters or hyphens (-), and must not begin or end with
              a hyphen.

          IpAddressType -> (string)
              The IP address type that an accelerator supports. For a standard
              accelerator, the value can be IPV4 or DUAL_STACK.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether the accelerator is enabled. The value is true
              or false. The default value is true.

              If the value is set to true, the accelerator cannot be  deleted.
              If set to false, accelerator can be deleted.

          IpSets -> (list)
              The  static IP addresses that Global Accelerator associates with
              the accelerator.

              (structure)
                 A complex type for the set of IP addresses for  an  accelera-
                 tor.

                 IpFamily -> (string)
                     IpFamily  is  deprecated  and  has been replaced by IpAd-
                     dressFamily.

                 IpAddresses -> (list)
                     The array of IP addresses in the IP address  set.  An  IP
                     address set can have a maximum of two IP addresses.

                     (string)

                 IpAddressFamily -> (string)
                     The types of IP addresses included in this IP set.

          DnsName -> (string)
              The  Domain  Name System (DNS) name that Global Accelerator cre-
              ates that points to an accelerator's static IPv4 addresses.

              The naming convention for the DNS name for an accelerator is the
              following: A lowercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random hex
              string,  followed  by  .awsglobalaccelerator.com.  For  example:
              a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

              If you have a dual-stack accelerator, you also have a second DNS
              name, DualStackDnsName , that points to both the  A  record  and
              the  AAAA record for all four static addresses for the accelera-
              tor: two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

              For more information about the default DNS name, see Support for
              DNS  addressing  in Global Accelerator in the Global Accelerator
              Developer Guide .

          Status -> (string)
              Describes the deployment status of the accelerator.

          CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the accelerator was created.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the accelerator was last modified.

          DualStackDnsName -> (string)
              The Domain Name System (DNS) name that Global  Accelerator  cre-
              ates  that  points  to a dual-stack accelerator's four static IP
              addresses: two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

              The naming convention for the dual-stack DNS name is the follow-
              ing:  A  lowercase  letter  a,  followed  by a 16-bit random hex
              string, followed by .dualstack.awsglobalaccelerator.com. For ex-
              ample: a1234567890abcdef.dualstack.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

              Note:  Global  Accelerator  also  assigns  a  default  DNS name,
              DnsName , to your accelerator that points  just  to  the  static
              IPv4 addresses.

              For  more  information, see Support for DNS addressing in Global
              Accelerator in the Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

          Events -> (list)

              Accelerator.

              (structure)
                 A  complex  type  that contains a Timestamp value and Message
                 for changes that you make to an accelerator in Global  Accel-
                 erator. Messages stored here provide progress or error infor-
                 mation  when  you  update  an  accelerator   from   IPv4   to
                 dual-stack,  or  from  dual-stack to IPv4. Global Accelerator
                 stores a maximum of ten event messages.

                 Message -> (string)
                     A  string  that  contains  an  Event  message  describing
                     changes  or  errors  when  you  update  an accelerator in
                     Global Accelerator from IPv4 to dual-stack, or dual-stack
                     to IPv4.

                 Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                     A  timestamp for when you update an accelerator in Global
                     Accelerator from IPv4 to  dual-stack,  or  dual-stack  to
                     IPv4.
