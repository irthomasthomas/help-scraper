LIST-CUSTOM-ROUTING-ENDPOINT-GROUPS()    LIST-CUSTOM-ROUTING-ENDPOINT-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-custom-routing-endpoint-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       List the endpoint groups that are associated with a listener for a cus-
       tom routing accelerator.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-custom-routing-endpoint-groups is a paginated operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: EndpointGroups

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the listener to list endpoint
          groups for.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          custom routing accelerator.

          (structure)
              A complex type for the endpoint group for a custom  routing  ac-
              celerator.  An Amazon Web Services Region can have only one end-
              point group for a specific listener.

              EndpointGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

              EndpointGroupRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region where the  endpoint  group  is
                 located.

              DestinationDescriptions -> (list)
                 For  a  custom  routing accelerator, describes the port range
                 and protocol for all endpoints (virtual  private  cloud  sub-
                 nets) in an endpoint group to accept client traffic on.

                 (structure)
                     For  a  custom  routing  accelerator,  describes the port
                     range and protocol for  all  endpoints  (virtual  private
                     cloud  subnets)  in  an  endpoint  group to accept client
                     traffic on.

                     FromPort -> (integer)
                        The first port, inclusive, in the range of  ports  for
                        the  endpoint  group  that is associated with a custom
                        routing accelerator.

                     ToPort -> (integer)
                        The last port, inclusive, in the range  of  ports  for
                        the  endpoint  group  that is associated with a custom
                        routing accelerator.

                     Protocols -> (list)
                        The protocol for the endpoint group that is associated
                        with a custom routing accelerator. The protocol can be
                        either TCP or UDP.

                        (string)

              EndpointDescriptions -> (list)
                 For a custom routing  accelerator,  describes  the  endpoints
                 (virtual  private  cloud subnets) in an endpoint group to ac-
                 cept client traffic on.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type for an endpoint for a custom  routing  ac-
                     celerator.  Each  endpoint  group can include one or more
                     endpoints, which are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.

                     EndpointId -> (string)
                        An ID for the endpoint. For custom  routing  accelera-
                        tors,  this  is the virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet
                        ID.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
