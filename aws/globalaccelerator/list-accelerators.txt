LIST-ACCELERATORS()                                        LIST-ACCELERATORS()



NAME
       list-accelerators -

DESCRIPTION
       List the accelerators for an Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-accelerators  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Accelerators

SYNOPSIS
            list-accelerators
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Accelerators -> (list)
          The list of accelerators for a customer account.

          (structure)
              An  accelerator is a complex type that includes one or more lis-
              teners that process inbound connections and then direct  traffic
              to  one  or  more  endpoint  groups, each of which includes end-
              points, such as load balancers.

              AcceleratorArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the accelerator.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the accelerator. The name must contain  only  al-
                 phanumeric  characters  or hyphens (-), and must not begin or
                 end with a hyphen.

              IpAddressType -> (string)
                 The IP address type that an accelerator supports. For a stan-
                 dard accelerator, the value can be IPV4 or DUAL_STACK.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  accelerator is enabled. The value is
                 true or false. The default value is true.

                 If the value is  set  to  true,  the  accelerator  cannot  be
                 deleted. If set to false, accelerator can be deleted.

              IpSets -> (list)
                 The  static  IP  addresses that Global Accelerator associates
                 with the accelerator.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type for the set of IP addresses for an  accel-
                     erator.

                     IpFamily -> (string)
                        IpFamily  is deprecated and has been replaced by IpAd-
                        dressFamily.

                     IpAddresses -> (list)
                        The array of IP addresses in the IP address set. An IP
                        address set can have a maximum of two IP addresses.

                        (string)

                     IpAddressFamily -> (string)
                        The types of IP addresses included in this IP set.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The  Domain  Name  System  (DNS) name that Global Accelerator
                 creates that points  to  an  accelerator's  static  IPv4  ad-
                 dresses.

                 The  naming convention for the DNS name for an accelerator is
                 the following: A lowercase letter a,  followed  by  a  16-bit
                 random hex string, followed by .awsglobalaccelerator.com. For
                 example: a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

                 If you have a dual-stack accelerator, you also have a  second
                 DNS  name, DualStackDnsName, that points to both the A record
                 and the AAAA record for all four static addresses for the ac-
                 celerator (two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses).

                 For  more information about the default DNS name, see Support
                 for DNS Addressing in Global Accelerator in the Global Accel-
                 erator Developer Guide .

              Status -> (string)
                 Describes the deployment status of the accelerator.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the accelerator was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the accelerator was last modified.

              DualStackDnsName -> (string)
                 The  Domain  Name  System  (DNS) name that Global Accelerator
                 creates that points to a dual-stack accelerator's four static
                 IP addresses: two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

                 The naming convention for the dual-stack DNS name is the fol-
                 lowing: A lowercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random hex
                 string,  followed by .dualstack.awsglobalaccelerator.com. For
                 example:       a1234567890abcdef.dualstack.awsglobalaccelera-
                 tor.com.

                 Note:  Global  Accelerator  also  assigns a default DNS name,
                 DnsName, to your accelerator that points just to  the  static
                 IPv4 addresses.

                 For  more  information,  see  Support  for  DNS Addressing in
                 Global Accelerator in the Global Accelerator Developer  Guide
                 .

              Events -> (list)
                 A  history  of  changes  that  you  make to an accelerator in
                 Global Accelerator.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type that contains a Timestamp value  and  Mes-
                     sage  for  changes  that  you  make  to an accelerator in
                     Global Accelerator. Messages stored here provide progress
                     or  error information when you update an accelerator from
                     IPv4 to dual-stack, or from dual-stack  to  IPv4.  Global
                     Accelerator stores a maximum of ten event messages.

                     Message -> (string)
                        A  string  that  contains  an Event message describing
                        changes or errors when you update  an  accelerator  in
                        Global   Accelerator   from  IPv4  to  dual-stack,  or
                        dual-stack to IPv4.

                     Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                        A timestamp for when  you  update  an  accelerator  in
                        Global   Accelerator   from  IPv4  to  dual-stack,  or
                        dual-stack to IPv4.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
