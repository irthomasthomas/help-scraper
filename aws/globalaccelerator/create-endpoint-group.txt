CREATE-ENDPOINT-GROUP()                                CREATE-ENDPOINT-GROUP()



NAME
       create-endpoint-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an endpoint group for the specified listener. An endpoint group
       is a collection of endpoints in one Amazon Web Services Region.  A  re-
       source must be valid and active when you add it as an endpoint.

       For  more  information  about  endpoint types and requirements for end-
       points that you can add to Global Accelerator, see Endpoints for  stan-
       dard accelerators in the Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

       --endpoint-group-region (string)
          The  Amazon Web Services Region where the endpoint group is located.
          A listener can have only one endpoint group in a specific Region.

       --endpoint-configurations (list)
          The list of endpoint objects.

          (structure)
              A complex type for endpoints. A resource must be valid  and  ac-
              tive when you add it as an endpoint.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 An  ID  for  the  endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load
                 Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Re-
                 source  Name  (ARN)  of  the  resource. If the endpoint is an
                 Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation
                 ID.  For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID. A
                 resource must be valid and active when you add it as an  end-
                 point.

                 An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or inter-
                 net-facing.

              Weight -> (integer)
                 The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights
                 to endpoints, you configure Global Accelerator to route traf-
                 fic based on proportions that you specify. For  example,  you
                 might  specify  endpoint  weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20).
                 The result is that 4/20  of  your  traffic,  on  average,  is
                 routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the sec-
                 ond and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last  end-
                 point.  For  more  information,  see  Endpoint weights in the
                 Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

              ClientIPPreservationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether client IP address preservation  is  enabled
                 for  an  endpoint.  The  value  is true or false. The default
                 value is true for new accelerators.

                 If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is  pre-
                 served in the X-Forwarded-For request header as traffic trav-
                 els to applications on the endpoint fronted by the  accelera-
                 tor.

                 Client IP address preservation is supported, in specific Ama-
                 zon Web Services Regions, for endpoints that are  Application
                 Load  Balancers,  Amazon EC2 instances, and Network Load Bal-
                 ancers with Security Groups. IMPORTANT: You cannot use client
                 IP  address preservation with Network Load Balancers with TLS
                 listeners.

                 For more information, see Preserve  client  IP  addresses  in
                 Global  Accelerator in the Global Accelerator Developer Guide
                 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EndpointId=string,Weight=integer,ClientIPPreservationEnabled=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EndpointId": "string",
              "Weight": integer,
              "ClientIPPreservationEnabled": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --traffic-dial-percentage (float)
          The percentage of traffic to send to an Amazon Web Services  Region.
          Additional  traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups for this
          listener.

          Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down)  traf-
          fic  to  a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic
          that would otherwise have been routed to the Region based on optimal
          routing.

          The default value is 100.

       --health-check-port (integer)
          The  port  that  Global Accelerator uses to check the health of end-
          points that are part of this endpoint group. The default port is the
          listener  port  that this endpoint group is associated with. If lis-
          tener port is a list of ports, Global  Accelerator  uses  the  first
          port in the list.

       --health-check-protocol (string)
          The  protocol  that  Global  Accelerator uses to check the health of
          endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is
          TCP.

          Possible values:

          o TCP

          o HTTP

          o HTTPS

       --health-check-path (string)
          If  the protocol is HTTP/S, then this specifies the path that is the
          destination for health check targets. The  default  value  is  slash
          (/).

       --health-check-interval-seconds (integer)
          The  time10  seconds  or  30 secondsbetween each health check for an
          endpoint. The default value is 30.

       --threshold-count (integer)
          The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of
          a  healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to
          healthy. The default value is 3.

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotencythat is, the uniquenessof the request.

       --port-overrides (list)
          Override  specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints
          that are part of this endpoint group. For example, you can create  a
          port  override  in which the listener receives user traffic on ports
          80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to  ports  1080
          and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.

          For  more  information,  see Overriding listener ports in the Global
          Accelerator Developer Guide .

          (structure)
              Override specific listener ports used to route traffic  to  end-
              points  that are part of an endpoint group. For example, you can
              create a port override in which the listener receives user traf-
              fic  on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traf-
              fic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.

              For more information,  see  Overriding  listener  ports  in  the
              Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

              ListenerPort -> (integer)
                 The listener port that you want to map to a specific endpoint
                 port. This is the port  that  user  traffic  arrives  to  the
                 Global Accelerator on.

              EndpointPort -> (integer)
                 The  endpoint port that you want a listener port to be mapped
                 to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as the Application
                 Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ListenerPort=integer,EndpointPort=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ListenerPort": integer,
              "EndpointPort": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an endpoint group

       The  following  create-endpoint-group example creates an endpoint group
       with one endpoint.

          aws globalaccelerator create-endpoint-group \
              --listener-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz \
              --endpoint-group-region us-east-1 \
              --endpoint-configurations EndpointId=i-1234567890abcdef0,Weight=128

       Output:

          {
              "EndpointGroup": {
                  "TrafficDialPercentage": 100.0,
                  "EndpointDescriptions": [
                      {
                          "Weight": 128,
                          "EndpointId": "i-1234567890abcdef0"
                      }
                  ],
                  "EndpointGroupArn": "arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz/endpoint-group/098765zyxwvu",
                  "EndpointGroupRegion": "us-east-1"
              }
          }

       the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       EndpointGroup -> (structure)
          The information about the endpoint group that was created.

          EndpointGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

          EndpointGroupRegion -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Web Services Region where the endpoint group is lo-
              cated.

          EndpointDescriptions -> (list)
              The list of endpoint objects.

              (structure)
                 A complex type for an endpoint. Each endpoint group  can  in-
                 clude one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.

                 EndpointId -> (string)
                     An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load
                     Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon
                     Resource  Name  (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is
                     an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address al-
                     location  ID.  For  Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2
                     instance ID.

                     An Application Load Balancer can be  either  internal  or
                     internet-facing.

                 Weight -> (integer)
                     The  weight  associated  with  the endpoint. When you add
                     weights to endpoints, you configure Global Accelerator to
                     route  traffic based on proportions that you specify. For
                     example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4,  5,  5,
                     and  6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic,
                     on average, is routed to  the  first  endpoint,  5/20  is
                     routed  both  to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20
                     is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see
                     Endpoint  weights  in  the  Global  Accelerator Developer
                     Guide .

                 HealthState -> (string)
                     The health status of the endpoint.

                 HealthReason -> (string)
                     Returns a null result.

                 ClientIPPreservationEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether client IP address preservation  is  en-
                     abled  for  an  endpoint. The value is true or false. The
                     default value is true for new accelerators.

                     If the value is set to true, the client's IP  address  is
                     preserved  in the X-Forwarded-For request header as traf-
                     fic travels to applications on the  endpoint  fronted  by
                     the accelerator.

                     Client  IP address preservation is supported, in specific
                     Amazon Web Services Regions, for endpoints that  are  Ap-
                     plication  Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, and Net-
                     work Load Balancers with Security Groups. IMPORTANT:  You
                     cannot  use  client  IP address preservation with Network
                     Load Balancers with TLS listeners.

                     For more information, see Preserve client IP addresses in
                     Global  Accelerator  in  the Global Accelerator Developer
                     Guide .

          TrafficDialPercentage -> (float)
              The percentage of traffic to send to an Amazon Web Services  Re-
              gion. Additional traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups
              for this listener.

              Use this action to increase (dial up) or  decrease  (dial  down)
              traffic  to  a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the
              traffic that would otherwise have  been  routed  to  the  Region
              based on optimal routing.

              The default value is 100.

          HealthCheckPort -> (integer)
              The  port  that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks
              on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group.

              The default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint
              group is associated with. If the listener port is a list, Global
              Accelerator uses the first specified port in the list of ports.

          HealthCheckProtocol -> (string)
              The protocol that Global  Accelerator  uses  to  perform  health
              checks  on  endpoints  that are part of this endpoint group. The
              default value is TCP.

          HealthCheckPath -> (string)
              If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this  value  provides  the  ping
              path  that  Global  Accelerator  uses for the destination on the
              endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).

          HealthCheckIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
              The time10 seconds or 30 secondsbetween health checks  for  each
              endpoint. The default value is 30.

          ThresholdCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  consecutive  health  checks required to set the
              state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy
              endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

          PortOverrides -> (list)
              Allows you to override the destination ports used to route traf-
              fic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you map a list of
              external  destination ports (that your users send traffic to) to
              a list of internal destination ports that you want  an  applica-
              tion endpoint to receive traffic on.

              (structure)
                 Override  specific  listener  ports  used to route traffic to
                 endpoints that are part of an endpoint  group.  For  example,
                 you can create a port override in which the listener receives
                 user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes
                 that  traffic  to  ports  1080 and 1443, respectively, on the
                 endpoints.

                 For more information, see Overriding listener  ports  in  the
                 Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

                 ListenerPort -> (integer)
                     The listener port that you want to map to a specific end-
                     point port. This is the port that user traffic arrives to
                     the Global Accelerator on.

                 EndpointPort -> (integer)
                     The  endpoint  port  that  you want a listener port to be
                     mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as  the
                     Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.
