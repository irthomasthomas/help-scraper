          --accelerator-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accelerator-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the accelerator to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Accelerator -> (structure)
          The description of the custom routing accelerator.

          AcceleratorArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom  routing  accelera-
              tor.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the accelerator. The name must contain only alphanu-
              meric characters or hyphens (-), and must not begin or end  with
              a hyphen.

          IpAddressType -> (string)
              The  IP  address type that an accelerator supports. For a custom
              routing accelerator, the value must be IPV4.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the accelerator is enabled. The value is  true
              or false. The default value is true.

              If  the value is set to true, the accelerator cannot be deleted.
              If set to false, accelerator can be deleted.

          IpSets -> (list)
              The static IP addresses that Global Accelerator associates  with
              the accelerator.

              (structure)
                 A  complex  type for the set of IP addresses for an accelera-
                 tor.

                 IpFamily -> (string)
                     IpFamily is deprecated and has  been  replaced  by  IpAd-
                     dressFamily.

                 IpAddresses -> (list)
                     The  array  of  IP addresses in the IP address set. An IP
                     address set can have a maximum of two IP addresses.

                     (string)

                 IpAddressFamily -> (string)
                     The types of IP addresses included in this IP set.

          DnsName -> (string)
              The Domain Name System (DNS) name that Global  Accelerator  cre-
              ates that points to an accelerator's static IPv4 addresses.

              The  naming convention for the DNS name is the following: A low-
              ercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random  hex  string,  fol-
              lowed     by     .awsglobalaccelerator.com.     For     example:
              a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

              If you have a dual-stack accelerator, you also have a second DNS
              name,  DualStackDnsName  ,  that points to both the A record and
              the AAAA record for all four static addresses for the  accelera-
              tor: two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

              For more information about the default DNS name, see Support for
              DNS addressing in Global Accelerator in the  Global  Accelerator
              Developer Guide .

          Status -> (string)
              Describes the deployment status of the accelerator.

          CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the accelerator was created.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the accelerator was last modified.
