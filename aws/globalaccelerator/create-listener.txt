CREATE-LISTENER()                                            CREATE-LISTENER()



NAME
       create-listener -

DESCRIPTION
       Create a listener to process inbound connections from clients to an ac-
       celerator. Connections arrive to assigned  static  IP  addresses  on  a
       port, port range, or list of port ranges that you specify.

OPTIONS
       --accelerator-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your accelerator.

       --port-ranges (list)
          The  list  of port ranges to support for connections from clients to
          your accelerator.

          (structure)
              A complex type for a range of ports for a listener.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 The first port in the range of ports, inclusive.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 The last port in the range of ports, inclusive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FromPort": integer,
              "ToPort": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --protocol (string)
          The protocol for connections from clients to your accelerator.

          Possible values:

          o TCP

          o UDP

       --client-affinity (string)
          Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same
          endpoint,  if you have stateful applications, regardless of the port
          and protocol of the client request. Client affinity gives  you  con-
          trol  over  whether to always route each client to the same specific
          endpoint.

          Global Accelerator  uses  a  consistent-flow  hashing  algorithm  to
          choose  the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is
          NONE , Global Accelerator uses the  "five-tuple"  (5-tuple)  proper-
          tiessource IP address, source port, destination IP address, destina-
          tion port, and protocolto select the hash value,  and  then  chooses
          the  best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses dif-
          ferent ports to connect to  Global  Accelerator,  their  connections
          might  not  be  always  routed to the same endpoint because the hash
          value changes.

          If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint,
          set client affinity to SOURCE_IP instead. When you use the SOURCE_IP
          setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple"  (2-tuple)  proper-
          ties  source (client) IP address and destination IP addressto select
          the hash value.

          The default value is NONE .

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o SOURCE_IP

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotencythat is, the uniquenessof the request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a listener

       The  following  create-listener  example  creates  a  listener with two
       ports.

          aws globalaccelerator create-listener \
              --accelerator-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::123456789012:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh \
              --port-ranges FromPort=80,ToPort=80 FromPort=81,ToPort=81 \
              --protocol TCP

       Output:

          {
              "Listener": {
                  "PortRanges": [
                      {
                          "ToPort": 80,
                          "FromPort": 80
                      },
                      {
                          "ToPort": 81,
                          "FromPort": 81
                      }
                  ],
                  "ClientAffinity": "NONE",
                  "Protocol": "TCP",
                  "ListenerArn": "arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Listener -> (structure)
          The listener that you've created.

          ListenerArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

          PortRanges -> (list)
              The  list of port ranges for the connections from clients to the
              accelerator.

              (structure)
                 A complex type for a range of ports for a listener.

                 FromPort -> (integer)
                     The first port in the range of ports, inclusive.

                 ToPort -> (integer)
                     The last port in the range of ports, inclusive.

          Protocol -> (string)
              The protocol for the connections from clients to  the  accelera-
              tor.

          ClientAffinity -> (string)
              Client  affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the
              same endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless  of
              the  port  and  protocol  of the client request. Client affinity
              gives you control over whether to always route  each  client  to
              the same specific endpoint.

              Global  Accelerator  uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to
              choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity
              is  NONE  ,  Global  Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple)
              propertiessource IP address, source  port,  destination  IP  ad-
              dress,  destination  port, and protocolto select the hash value,
              and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this  setting,
              if  someone  uses different ports to connect to Global Accelera-
              tor, their connections might not be always routed  to  the  same
              endpoint because the hash value changes.

              If  you want a given client to always be routed to the same end-
              point, set client affinity to SOURCE_IP instead.  When  you  use
              the  SOURCE_IP  setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple"
              (2-tuple) properties source (client) IP address and  destination
              IP addressto select the hash value.

              The default value is NONE .
