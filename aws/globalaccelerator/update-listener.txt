OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener to update.

       --port-ranges (list)
          The  updated list of port ranges for the connections from clients to
          the accelerator.

          (structure)
              A complex type for a range of ports for a listener.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 The first port in the range of ports, inclusive.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 The last port in the range of ports, inclusive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FromPort": integer,
              "ToPort": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --protocol (string)
          The updated protocol for the connections from clients to the  accel-
          erator.

          Possible values:

          o TCP

          o UDP

       --client-affinity (string)
          Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same
          endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the  port
          and  protocol  of the client request. Client affinity gives you con-
          trol over whether to always route each client to the  same  specific
          endpoint.

          Global  Accelerator  uses  a  consistent-flow  hashing  algorithm to
          choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity  is
          NONE  ,  Global  Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) proper-
          tiessource IP address, source port, destination IP address, destina-
          tion  port,  and  protocolto select the hash value, and then chooses
          the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses  dif-
          ferent  ports  to  connect  to Global Accelerator, their connections
          might not be always routed to the same  endpoint  because  the  hash
          value changes.

          If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint,
          set client affinity to SOURCE_IP instead. When you use the SOURCE_IP
          setting,  Global  Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) proper-
          ties source (client) IP address and destination IP addressto  select
          the hash value.

          The default value is NONE .

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o SOURCE_IP

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a listener

       The following update-listener example updates a listener to change  the
       port to 100.

          aws globalaccelerator update-listener \
              --listener-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz \
              --port-ranges FromPort=100,ToPort=100

       Output:

          {
              "Listener": {
                  "ListenerArn": "arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz
                  "PortRanges": [
                      {
                          "FromPort": 100,
                          "ToPort": 100
                      }
                  ],
                  "Protocol": "TCP",
                  "ClientAffinity": "NONE"
              }
          }

       AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Listener -> (structure)
          Information for the updated listener.

          ListenerArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

          PortRanges -> (list)
              The list of port ranges for the connections from clients to  the
              accelerator.

              (structure)
                 A complex type for a range of ports for a listener.

                 FromPort -> (integer)
                     The first port in the range of ports, inclusive.

                 ToPort -> (integer)
                     The last port in the range of ports, inclusive.

          Protocol -> (string)
              The  protocol  for the connections from clients to the accelera-
              tor.

          ClientAffinity -> (string)
              Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to  the
              same  endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of
              the port and protocol of the  client  request.  Client  affinity
              gives  you  control  over whether to always route each client to
              the same specific endpoint.

              Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing  algorithm  to
              choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity
              is NONE , Global Accelerator  uses  the  "five-tuple"  (5-tuple)
              propertiessource  IP  address,  source  port, destination IP ad-
              dress, destination port, and protocolto select the  hash  value,
              and  then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting,
              if someone uses different ports to connect to  Global  Accelera-
              tor,  their  connections  might not be always routed to the same
              endpoint because the hash value changes.

              If you want a given client to always be routed to the same  end-
              point,  set  client  affinity to SOURCE_IP instead. When you use
              the SOURCE_IP setting, Global Accelerator uses  the  "two-tuple"
              (2-tuple)  properties source (client) IP address and destination
              IP addressto select the hash value.

              The default value is NONE .
