CREATE-CROSS-ACCOUNT-ATTACHMENT()            CREATE-CROSS-ACCOUNT-ATTACHMENT()



NAME
       create-cross-account-attachment -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  a  cross-account attachment in Global Accelerator. You create a
       cross-account attachment to specify the principals who have  permission
       to  work with resources in accelerators in their own account. You spec-
       ify, in the same attachment, the resources that are shared.

       A principal can be an Amazon Web Services account number or the  Amazon
       Resource  Name  (ARN)  for an accelerator. For account numbers that are
       listed as principals, to work with a resource listed in the attachment,
       you  must sign in to an account specified as a principal. Then, you can
       work with resources that are listed, with any of your accelerators.  If
       an accelerator ARN is listed in the cross-account attachment as a prin-
       cipal, anyone with permission to make updates to  the  accelerator  can
       work with resources that are listed in the attachment.

       Specify each principal and resource separately. To specify two CIDR ad-
       dress pools, list them individually under Resources , and so on. For  a
       command line operation, for example, you might use a statement like the
       following:
          "Resources":          [{"Cidr":          "169.254.60.0/24"},{"Cidr":
          "169.254.59.0/24"}]

       For  more  information,  see Working with cross-account attachments and
       resources in Global Accelerator in  the  Global  Accelerator  Developer
       Guide .

       --principals (list)
          The principals to include in the cross-account attachment. A princi-
          pal can be an Amazon Web Services account number or the  Amazon  Re-
          source Name (ARN) for an accelerator.

       --resources (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the resources to include in the

          Services  resource type for Global Accelerator or a CIDR range for a
          bring your own IP address (BYOIP) address pool.

          (structure)
              A resource is one of the following: the ARN for  an  Amazon  Web
              Services  resource that is supported by Global Accelerator to be
              added as an endpoint, or a CIDR range  that  specifies  a  bring
              your own IP (BYOIP) address pool.

                 Amazon  Web  Services  resource,  such as a Network Load Bal-
                 ancer, that Global Accelerator supports as an endpoint for an
                 accelerator.

              Cidr -> (string)
                 An IP address range, in CIDR format, that is specified as re-
                 source. The address must be  provisioned  and  advertised  in
                 Global Accelerator by following the bring your own IP address
                 (BYOIP) process for Global Accelerator

                 For more information, see Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP)

                 The  Amazon  Web  Services Region where a shared endpoint re-
                 source is located.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EndpointId=string,Cidr=string,Region=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EndpointId": "string",
              "Cidr": "string",
              "Region": "string"

          idempotencythat is, the uniquenessof the request.

       --tags (list)

            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
