DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how inter-
       net issues impact the performance and availability between your  appli-
       cations  hosted on Amazon Web Services and your end users, reducing the
       time it takes for you to diagnose these issues, from days  to  minutes.
       You  can explore internet measurements for different time frames and at
       different geographic granularities, and quickly visualize the impact of
       issues, and then take action to improve your end users' experience, for
       example, by switching to other Amazon Web Services services or  rerout-
       ing  traffic  to your workload through differentAmazon Web Services Re-
       gions.

       If the issue is caused by the Amazon Web Services network, you'll auto-
       matically  receive an Amazon Web Services Health Dashboard notification
       with the steps that Amazon Web Services is taking to mitigate the prob-
       lem. To support integrating health information for geographies and net-
       works specific to your application, Internet Monitor delivers  measure-
       ments  to CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Metrics. Internet Monitor also
       sends health events to Amazon EventBridge, so you can set up  notifica-
       tions.  Internet Monitor monitors internet connectivity for your appli-
       cation through Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Amazon  CloudFront
       distributions, and Amazon WorkSpaces directories.

       To  use Internet Monitor, you create a monitor and add resources to it,
       Virtual Private Clouds  (VPCs),  Amazon  CloudFront  distributions,  or
       WorkSpaces  directories  that  show  where  your application's internet
       traffic is. Internet Monitor then provides internet  measurements  from
       Amazon  Web  Services  that  are specific to the locations and networks
       that communicate with your application. For more information, see Using
       Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
