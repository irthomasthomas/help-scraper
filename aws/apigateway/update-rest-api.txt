OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --patch-operations (list)
          For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch Op-
          erations .

          (structure)
              For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch
              Operations .

              op -> (string)
                 An  update operation to be performed with this PATCH request.
                 The valid value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not  all
                 valid  operations are supported for a given resource. Support
                 of the operations depends on specific  operational  contexts.
                 Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will
                 return an error message..

              path -> (string)
                 The op operation's target, as identified by  a  JSON  Pointer
                 value  that  references  a  location  within the targeted re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property  of  {"name":"value"}, the path for this property is
                 /name. If the name property value is  a  JSON  object  (e.g.,
                 {"name":  {"child/name":  "child-value"}}),  the path for the
                 child/name property  will  be  /name/child~1name.  Any  slash
                 ("/")  character appearing in path names must be escaped with
                 "~1", as shown in the example above. Each  op  operation  can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The  new target value of the update operation. It is applica-
                 ble for the add or replace operation. When using AWS  CLI  to
                 update  a  property  of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object
                 with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell,  e.g.,  '{"a":
                 ...}'.

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer value referencing the location within  the  tar-
                 geted  resource  to copy the value from. For example, to pro-
                 mote a canary deployment, you copy the canary  deployment  ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a  Stage  resource  with   "op":"copy",   "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To change the name of an API

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-rest-api --rest-api-id 1234123412 --patch-operations op=replace,path=/name,value='New Name'

       To change the description of an API

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-rest-api --rest-api-id 1234123412 --patch-operations op=replace,path=/description,value='New Description'

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The  API's  identifier. This identifier is unique across all of your
          APIs in API Gateway.

       name -> (string)
          The API's name.

       description -> (string)
          The API's description.

       createdDate -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp when the API was created.

       version -> (string)
          A version identifier for the API.

       warnings -> (list)
          The warning messages reported when failonwarnings is turned on  dur-
          ing API import.

          (string)

       binaryMediaTypes -> (list)
          The list of binary media types supported by the RestApi. By default,
          the RestApi supports only UTF-8-encoded text payloads.

          (string)

       minimumCompressionSize -> (integer)
          A nullable integer that is used to enable compression (with non-neg-
          ative between 0 and 10485760 (10M) bytes, inclusive) or disable com-
          pression (with a null value) on an API. When compression is enabled,
          compression  or  decompression  is not applied on the payload if the
          payload size is smaller than this value. Setting it to  zero  allows
          compression for any payload size.

       apiKeySource -> (string)
          The source of the API key for metering requests according to a usage
          plan. Valid values are: >``HEADER`` to read the  API  key  from  the
          X-API-Key  header  of a request. AUTHORIZER to read the API key from
          the UsageIdentifierKey from a custom authorizer.

       endpointConfiguration -> (structure)
          The endpoint configuration of  this  RestApi  showing  the  endpoint
          types of the API.

          types -> (list)
              A  list  of endpoint types of an API (RestApi) or its custom do-
              main name (DomainName). For an edge-optimized API and its custom
              domain  name,  the  endpoint type is "EDGE" . For a regional API
              and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is REGIONAL .  For
              a private API, the endpoint type is PRIVATE .

              (string)
                 The  endpoint  type. The valid values are EDGE for edge-opti-
                 mized API setup, most suitable for mobile  applications;  RE-
                 GIONAL  for  regional  API  endpoint setup, most suitable for
                 calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE for private APIs.

          vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
              A list of VpcEndpointIds of an API (RestApi)  against  which  to
              create  Route53  ALIASes.  It is only supported for PRIVATE end-
              point type.

              (string)

       policy -> (string)
          A stringified JSON policy document that applies to this RestApi  re-
          gardless of the caller and Method configuration.

          resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       disableExecuteApiEndpoint -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether clients can invoke your API by using  the  default
          execute-api  endpoint.  By default, clients can invoke your API with
          the default https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com end-
          point.  To  require  that clients use a custom domain name to invoke
          your API, disable the default endpoint.
