          ate certificates and end with the root certificate. Use the interme-
          diate certificates that were provided by your certificate authority.
          Do not include any intermediaries that are not in the chain of trust
          path.

       --certificate-arn (string)
          The reference to an Amazon  Web  Services-managed  certificate  that

       --mutual-tls-authentication (structure)
          The mutual TLS authentication  configuration  for  a  custom  domain
          name.  If specified, API Gateway performs two-way authentication be-
          tween the client and the server. Clients must present a trusted cer-
          tificate to access your API.

          truststoreUri -> (string)
              An  Amazon  S3  URL that specifies the truststore for mutual TLS
              authentication,  for  example  s3://bucket-name/key-name  .  The
              truststore  can contain certificates from public or private cer-
              tificate authorities. To update the  truststore,  upload  a  new
              version  to  S3,  and then update your custom domain name to use
              the new version. To update the truststore, you must have permis-
              sions to access the S3 object.

          truststoreVersion -> (string)
              The  version  of the S3 object that contains your truststore. To

          The  ARN  of the public certificate issued by ACM to validate owner-
          ship of your custom domain. Only required  when  configuring  mutual
          TLS  and  using an ACM imported or private CA certificate ARN as the
          regionalCertificateArn.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
