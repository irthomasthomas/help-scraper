OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --resource-id (string)
          The Resource identifier for the MethodResponse resource.

       --http-method (string)
          The HTTP verb of the Method resource.

       --status-code (string)
          The status code for the MethodResponse resource.

       --patch-operations (list)
          For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch Op-
          erations .

          (structure)
              For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch
              Operations .

              op -> (string)
                 An  update operation to be performed with this PATCH request.
                 The valid value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not  all
                 valid  operations are supported for a given resource. Support
                 of the operations depends on specific  operational  contexts.
                 Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will
                 return an error message..

              path -> (string)
                 The op operation's target, as identified by  a  JSON  Pointer
                 value  that  references  a  location  within the targeted re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property  of  {"name":"value"}, the path for this property is
                 /name. If the name property value is  a  JSON  object  (e.g.,
                 {"name":  {"child/name":  "child-value"}}),  the path for the
                 child/name property  will  be  /name/child~1name.  Any  slash
                 ("/")  character appearing in path names must be escaped with
                 "~1", as shown in the example above. Each  op  operation  can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The  new target value of the update operation. It is applica-
                 ble for the add or replace operation. When using AWS  CLI  to
                 update  a  property  of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object
                 with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell,  e.g.,  '{"a":
                 ...}'.

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer value referencing the location within  the  tar-
                 geted  resource  to copy the value from. For example, to pro-
                 mote a canary deployment, you copy the canary  deployment  ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a  Stage  resource  with   "op":"copy",   "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a new method response header for the 200 response in a method
       and define it as not required (default)

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-method-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id a1b2c3 --http-method GET --status-code 200 --patch-operations op="add",path="/responseParameters/method.response.header.custom-header",value="false"

       To delete a response model for the 200 response in a method

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-method-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id a1b2c3 --http-method GET --status-code 200 --patch-operations op="remove",path="/responseModels/application~1json"

OUTPUT
       statusCode -> (string)
          The method response's status code.

       responseParameters -> (map)
          A  key-value map specifying required or optional response parameters
          that API Gateway can send back to the caller. A key defines a method
          response  header  and  the  value  specifies  whether the associated
          method response header is required or not. The expression of the key
          must match the pattern method.response.header.{name} , where name is
          a valid and unique header name. API Gateway passes certain  integra-
          tion response data to the method response headers specified here ac-
          cording to the mapping you prescribe  in  the  API's  IntegrationRe-
          sponse.  The integration response data that can be mapped include an
          integration   response   header   expressed    in    integration.re-
          sponse.header.{name} , a static value enclosed within a pair of sin-
          gle quotes (e.g., 'application/json' ), or a  JSON  expression  from
          the  back-end  response  payload  in  the  form  of  integration.re-
          sponse.body.{JSON-expression} , where  JSON-expression  is  a  valid
          JSON expression without the $ prefix.)

          key -> (string)

          value -> (boolean)

       responseModels -> (map)
          Specifies  the Model resources used for the response's content-type.
          Response models are represented as a  key/value  map,  with  a  con-
          tent-type as the key and a Model name as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
