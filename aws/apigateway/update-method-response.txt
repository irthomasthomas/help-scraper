SYNOPSIS
            update-method-response
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          --http-method <value>

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --resource-id (string)
          The Resource identifier for the MethodResponse resource.

       --http-method (string)
          The HTTP verb of the Method resource.

       --status-code (string)
          The status code for the MethodResponse resource.

       --patch-operations (list)
          For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch Op-
          erations .

          (structure)
              For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch
              Operations .

              op -> (string)
                 An  update operation to be performed with this PATCH request.
                 The valid value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not  all
                 valid  operations are supported for a given resource. Support
                 of the operations depends on specific  operational  contexts.
                 Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will
                 return an error message..

              path -> (string)
                 The op operation's target, as identified by  a  JSON  Pointer
                 value  that  references  a  location  within the targeted re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property  of  {"name":"value"}, the path for this property is
                 /name. If the name property value is  a  JSON  object  (e.g.,
                 {"name":  {"child/name":  "child-value"}}),  the path for the
                 child/name property  will  be  /name/child~1name.  Any  slash
                 ("/")  character appearing in path names must be escaped with
                 "~1", as shown in the example above. Each  op  operation  can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The  new target value of the update operation. It is applica-
                 ble for the add or replace operation. When using AWS  CLI  to
                 update  a  property  of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object
                 with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell,  e.g.,  '{"a":
                 ...}'.

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer value referencing the location within  the  tar-
                 geted  resource  to copy the value from. For example, to pro-
                 mote a canary deployment, you copy the canary  deployment  ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a  Stage  resource  with   "op":"copy",   "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a new method response header for the 200 response in a method
       and define it as not required (default)

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-method-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id a1b2c3 --http-method GET --status-code 200 --patch-operations op="add",path="/responseParameters/method.response.header.custom-header",value="false"

       To delete a response model for the 200 response in a method

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-method-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id a1b2c3 --http-method GET --status-code 200 --patch-operations op="remove",path="/responseModels/application~1json"

OUTPUT
       statusCode -> (string)
          The method response's status code.

       responseParameters -> (map)
          A  key-value map specifying required or optional response parameters
          that API Gateway can send back to the caller. A key defines a method
          response  header  and  the  value  specifies  whether the associated
          method response header is required or not. The expression of the key
          must match the pattern method.response.header.{name} , where name is
          a valid and unique header name. API Gateway passes certain  integra-
          tion response data to the method response headers specified here ac-
          cording to the mapping you prescribe  in  the  API's  IntegrationRe-
          sponse.  The integration response data that can be mapped include an
          integration   response   header   expressed    in    integration.re-
          sponse.header.{name} , a static value enclosed within a pair of sin-
          gle quotes (e.g., 'application/json' ), or a  JSON  expression  from
          the  back-end  response  payload  in  the  form  of  integration.re-
          sponse.body.{JSON-expression} , where  JSON-expression  is  a  valid
          JSON expression without the $ prefix.)

          key -> (string)

          value -> (boolean)

       responseModels -> (map)
          Specifies  the Model resources used for the response's content-type.
          Response models are represented as a  key/value  map,  with  a  con-
          tent-type as the key and a Model name as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
