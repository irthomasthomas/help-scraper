       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-usage
          --usage-plan-id <value>
          --key-id <value>
          [--patch-operations <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --usage-plan-id (string)
          The Id of the usage plan associated with the usage data.

       --key-id (string)
          The identifier of the API key associated  with  the  usage  plan  in
          which a temporary extension is granted to the remaining quota.

       --patch-operations (list)
          For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch Op-
          erations .

          (structure)
              For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch
              Operations .

              op -> (string)
                 An  update operation to be performed with this PATCH request.
                 The valid value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not  all
                 valid  operations are supported for a given resource. Support
                 of the operations depends on specific  operational  contexts.
                 Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will
                 return an error message..

              path -> (string)
                 The op operation's target, as identified by  a  JSON  Pointer
                 value  that  references  a  location  within the targeted re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property  of  {"name":"value"}, the path for this property is
                 /name. If the name property value is  a  JSON  object  (e.g.,
                 {"name":  {"child/name":  "child-value"}}),  the path for the
                 child/name property  will  be  /name/child~1name.  Any  slash
                 ("/")  character appearing in path names must be escaped with
                 "~1", as shown in the example above. Each  op  operation  can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The  new target value of the update operation. It is applica-
                 ble for the add or replace operation. When using AWS  CLI  to
                 update  a  property  of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object
                 with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell,  e.g.,  '{"a":
                 ...}'.

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer value referencing the location within  the  tar-
                 geted  resource  to copy the value from. For example, to pro-
                 mote a canary deployment, you copy the canary  deployment  ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a  Stage  resource  with   "op":"copy",   "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  temporarily  modify  the quota on an API key for the current period
       defined in the Usage Plan

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-usage --usage-plan-id a1b2c3 --key-id 1NbjQzMReAkeEQPNAW8r3dXsU2rDD7fc7f2Sipnu --patch-operations op="replace",path="/remaining",value="50"

OUTPUT
       usagePlanId -> (string)
          The plan Id associated with this usage data.

       startDate -> (string)
          The starting date of the usage data.

       endDate -> (string)
          The ending date of the usage data.

       position -> (string)

       items -> (map)
          The usage data, as daily logs of used and remaining quotas, over the
          specified  time  interval indexed over the API keys in a usage plan.
          For example, {..., "values" : { "{api_key}" : [ [0, 100], [10,  90],
          [100,  10]]}  ,  where {api_key} stands for an API key value and the
          daily log entry is of the format [used quota, remaining quota] .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (list)
