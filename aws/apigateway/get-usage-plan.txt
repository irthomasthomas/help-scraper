GET-USAGE-PLAN()                                              GET-USAGE-PLAN()



NAME
       get-usage-plan -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a usage plan of a given plan identifier.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-usage-plan
          --usage-plan-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --usage-plan-id (string)
          The identifier of the UsagePlan resource to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The identifier of a UsagePlan resource.

       name -> (string)
          The name of a usage plan.

       description -> (string)
          The description of a usage plan.

       apiStages -> (list)
          The associated API stages of a usage plan.

          (structure)
              API stage name of the associated API stage in a usage plan.

              apiId -> (string)
                 API Id of the associated API stage in a usage plan.

              stage -> (string)
                 API stage name of the associated API stage in a usage plan.

              throttle -> (map)
                 Map containing method level throttling  information  for  API
                 stage in a usage plan.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     The API request rate limits.

                     burstLimit -> (integer)
                        The  API  target request burst rate limit. This allows
                        more requests through for a period of  time  than  the
                        target rate limit.

                     rateLimit -> (double)
                        The API target request rate limit.

       throttle -> (structure)
          A  map  containing method level throttling information for API stage
          in a usage plan.

          burstLimit -> (integer)
              The API target request burst rate limit. This  allows  more  re-
              quests through for a period of time than the target rate limit.

          rateLimit -> (double)
              The API target request rate limit.

       quota -> (structure)
          The  target  maximum  number  of permitted requests per a given unit
          time interval.

          limit -> (integer)
              The target maximum number of requests that  can  be  made  in  a
              given time period.

          offset -> (integer)
              The  number  of  requests subtracted from the given limit in the
              initial time period.

          period -> (string)
              The time period in which the limit  applies.  Valid  values  are
              "DAY", "WEEK" or "MONTH".

       productCode -> (string)
          The  AWS  Markeplace  product identifier to associate with the usage
          plan as a SaaS product on AWS Marketplace.

       tags -> (map)
          The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a  given
          resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
