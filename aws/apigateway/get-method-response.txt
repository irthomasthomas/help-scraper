NAME
       get-method-response -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a MethodResponse resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-method-response
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          --http-method <value>
          --status-code <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --resource-id (string)
          The Resource identifier for the MethodResponse resource.

       --http-method (string)
          The HTTP verb of the Method resource.

       --status-code (string)
          The status code for the MethodResponse resource.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the method response resource configuration for a HTTP method de-
       fined under a REST API's resource

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-method-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id y9h6rt --http-method GET --status-code 200

       Output:

          {
              "responseModels": {
                  "application/json": "Empty"
              },
              "statusCode": "200"
          }

OUTPUT
       statusCode -> (string)
          The method response's status code.

       responseParameters -> (map)
          A key-value map specifying required or optional response  parameters
          that API Gateway can send back to the caller. A key defines a method
          response header and  the  value  specifies  whether  the  associated
          method response header is required or not. The expression of the key
          must match the pattern method.response.header.{name} , where name is
          a  valid and unique header name. API Gateway passes certain integra-
          tion response data to the method response headers specified here ac-
          cording  to  the  mapping  you prescribe in the API's IntegrationRe-
          sponse. The integration response data that can be mapped include  an
          integration    response    header   expressed   in   integration.re-
          sponse.header.{name} , a static value enclosed within a pair of sin-
          gle  quotes  (e.g.,  'application/json' ), or a JSON expression from
          the  back-end  response  payload  in  the  form  of  integration.re-
          sponse.body.{JSON-expression}  ,  where  JSON-expression  is a valid
          JSON expression without the $ prefix.)

          key -> (string)

          value -> (boolean)

       responseModels -> (map)
          Specifies the Model resources used for the response's  content-type.
          Response  models  are  represented  as  a key/value map, with a con-
          tent-type as the key and a Model name as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
