DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  usage  plan  key  for adding an existing API key to a usage
       plan.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-usage-plan-key
          --usage-plan-id <value>
          --key-id <value>
          --key-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --usage-plan-id (string)
          The Id of the UsagePlan resource representing the  usage  plan  con-
          taining  the to-be-created UsagePlanKey resource representing a plan
          customer.

       --key-id (string)
          The identifier of a UsagePlanKey resource for a plan customer.

       --key-type (string)
          The type of a UsagePlanKey resource for a plan customer.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
