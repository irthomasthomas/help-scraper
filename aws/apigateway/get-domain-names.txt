GET-DOMAIN-NAMES()                                          GET-DOMAIN-NAMES()



NAME
       get-domain-names -

DESCRIPTION
       Represents a collection of DomainName resources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-domain-names  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: items

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 ated with this custom domain name for an edge-optimized  end-
                 point.  You  set up this association when adding a DNS record
                 pointing the custom domain name to  this  distribution  name.
                 For  more information about CloudFront distributions, see the
                 Amazon CloudFront documentation.

              distributionHostedZoneId -> (string)

                 types -> (list)
                     A  list of endpoint types of an API (RestApi) or its cus-
                     tom domain name (DomainName). For an  edge-optimized  API
                     and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is "EDGE" .
                     For a regional API and its custom domain name,  the  end-
                     point  type is REGIONAL . For a private API, the endpoint
                     type is PRIVATE .

                     (string)

                     (string)

              domainNameStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the DomainName migration. The valid values  are
                 AVAILABLE  and UPDATING . If the status is UPDATING , the do-
                 main cannot be modified further until the existing  operation
                 is complete. If it is AVAILABLE , the domain can be updated.

              domainNameStatusMessage -> (string)
                 An  optional  text  message  containing  detailed information
                 about status of the DomainName migration.

                 The Transport Layer Security (TLS) version + cipher suite for
                 this DomainName. The valid values are TLS_1_0 and TLS_1_2 .

              tags -> (map)
                 The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              mutualTlsAuthentication -> (structure)
                 The mutual TLS authentication configuration for a custom  do-
                 main name. If specified, API Gateway performs two-way authen-
                 tication between the client  and  the  server.  Clients  must
                 present a trusted certificate to access your API.

                 truststoreUri -> (string)
                     An Amazon S3 URL that specifies the truststore for mutual
                     TLS authentication, for example s3://bucket-name/key-name
                     .  The truststore can contain certificates from public or
                     private certificate authorities.  To  update  the  trust-
                     store,  upload  a new version to S3, and then update your
                     custom domain name to use the new version. To update  the
                     truststore,  you  must  have permissions to access the S3
                     object.

                 truststoreVersion -> (string)
                     The version of the S3 object that  contains  your  trust-
                     store. To specify a version, you must have versioning en-
                     abled for the S3 bucket.

                 truststoreWarnings -> (list)
                     A list of warnings that API Gateway  returns  while  pro-
                     cessing  your  truststore.  Invalid  certificates produce
                     warnings. Mutual TLS is still enabled, but  some  clients
                     might  not  be  able to access your API. To resolve warn-
                     ings, upload a new truststore to S3, and then update  you
                     domain name to use the new version.

                     (string)

              ownershipVerificationCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the public certificate issued by ACM to validate
                 ownership of your custom domain. Only required when configur-
                 ing  mutual  TLS and using an ACM imported or private CA cer-
                 tificate ARN as the regionalCertificateArn.
