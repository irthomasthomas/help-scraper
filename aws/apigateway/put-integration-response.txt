       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-integration-response
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          --http-method <value>
          --status-code <value>
          [--selection-pattern <value>]
          [--response-parameters <value>]
          [--response-templates <value>]
          [--content-handling <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --resource-id (string)
          Specifies a put integration response request's resource identifier.

       --http-method (string)
          Specifies a put integration response request's HTTP method.

       --status-code (string)
          Specifies  the  status  code that is used to map the integration re-
          sponse to an existing MethodResponse.

       --selection-pattern (string)
          Specifies the selection pattern of a put integration response.

       --response-parameters (map)
          A key-value map specifying response parameters that  are  passed  to
          the  method response from the back end. The key is a method response
          header parameter name and the mapped value  is  an  integration  re-
          sponse header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of single
          quotes, or a JSON expression from the integration response body. The
          mapping  key must match the pattern of method.response.header.{name}
          , where  name  is  a  valid  and  unique  header  name.  The  mapped
          non-static   value   must   match  the  pattern  of  integration.re-
          sponse.header.{name} or  integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}
          ,  where  name  must  be a valid and unique response header name and
          JSON-expression a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --response-templates (map)
          Specifies a put integration response's templates.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --content-handling (string)
          Specifies how to handle response payload content  type  conversions.
          Supported  values  are  CONVERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT , with
          the following behaviors:

          If this property is not defined, the response payload will be passed
          through from the integration response to the method response without
          modification.

          Possible values:

          o CONVERT_TO_BINARY

          o CONVERT_TO_TEXT

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an integration response as the default response with  a  map-
       ping template defined

       Command:

          aws apigateway put-integration-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id a1b2c3 --http-method GET --status-code 200 --selection-pattern "" --response-templates '{"application/json": "{\"json\": \"template\"}"}'

       To  create an integration response with a regex of 400 and a statically
       defined header value

       Command:

          aws apigateway put-integration-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id a1b2c3 --http-method GET --status-code 400 --selection-pattern 400 --response-parameters '{"method.response.header.custom-header": "'"'"'custom-value'"'"'"}'

OUTPUT
       statusCode -> (string)
          Specifies the status code that is used to map  the  integration  re-
          sponse to an existing MethodResponse.

       selectionPattern -> (string)
          Specifies  the  regular expression (regex) pattern used to choose an
          integration response based on the response from the  back  end.  For
          example,  if  the success response returns nothing and the error re-
          sponse returns some string, you could use the .+ regex to match  er-
          ror  response.  However,  make sure that the error response does not
          contain any newline (\n ) character in such cases. If the  back  end
          is  an  AWS Lambda function, the AWS Lambda function error header is
          matched. For all other HTTP and AWS back ends, the HTTP status  code
          is matched.

       responseParameters -> (map)
          A  key-value  map  specifying response parameters that are passed to
          the method response from the back end. The key is a method  response
          header  parameter  name  and  the mapped value is an integration re-
          sponse header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of single
          quotes, or a JSON expression from the integration response body. The
          mapping key must match the pattern of  method.response.header.{name}
          ,  where  name  is  a  valid  and  unique  header  name.  The mapped
          non-static  value  must  match  the   pattern   of   integration.re-
          sponse.header.{name}  or integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}
          , where name is a valid and unique response header name and JSON-ex-
          pression is a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       responseTemplates -> (map)
          Specifies  the  templates used to transform the integration response
          body. Response templates are represented as a key/value map, with  a
          content-type as the key and a template as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       contentHandling -> (string)
          Specifies  how  to handle response payload content type conversions.
          Supported values are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and  CONVERT_TO_TEXT  ,  with
          the following behaviors:

          If this property is not defined, the response payload will be passed
          through from the integration response to the method response without
          modification.
