       --patch-operations (list)
          For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch Op-
          erations .

          (structure)
              For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch
              Operations .

              op -> (string)
                 An update operation to be performed with this PATCH  request.
                 The  valid value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not all
                 valid operations are supported for a given resource.  Support
                 of  the  operations depends on specific operational contexts.
                 Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will
                 return an error message..

              path -> (string)
                 The  op  operation's  target, as identified by a JSON Pointer
                 value that references a  location  within  the  targeted  re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property of {"name":"value"}, the path for this  property  is
                 /name.  If  the  name  property value is a JSON object (e.g.,
                 {"name": {"child/name": "child-value"}}), the  path  for  the
                 child/name  property  will  be  /name/child~1name.  Any slash
                 ("/") character appearing in path names must be escaped  with
                 "~1",  as  shown  in the example above. Each op operation can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The new target value of the update operation. It is  applica-
                 ble  for  the add or replace operation. When using AWS CLI to
                 update a property of a JSON value, enclose  the  JSON  object
                 with  a  pair of single quotes in a Linux shell, e.g., '{"a":
                 ...}'.

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer  value  referencing the location within the tar-
                 geted resource to copy the value from. For example,  to  pro-
                 mote  a  canary deployment, you copy the canary deployment ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a   Stage   resource  with  "op":"copy",  "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       responseType -> (string)
          The response type of the associated GatewayResponse.

       statusCode -> (string)
          The HTTP status code for this GatewayResponse.

       responseParameters -> (map)
          Response  parameters (paths, query strings and headers) of the Gate-
          wayResponse as a string-to-string map of key-value pairs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       responseTemplates -> (map)
          Response templates of the GatewayResponse as a string-to-string  map
          of key-value pairs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       defaultResponse -> (boolean)
          A  Boolean  flag to indicate whether this GatewayResponse is the de-
          fault gateway response (true ) or not (false ).  A  default  gateway
          response  is  one generated by API Gateway without any customization
          by an API developer.
