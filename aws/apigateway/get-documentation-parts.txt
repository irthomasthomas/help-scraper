GET-DOCUMENTATION-PARTS()                            GET-DOCUMENTATION-PARTS()



NAME
       get-documentation-parts -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets documentation parts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-documentation-parts  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-documentation-parts
          --rest-api-id <value>
          [--type <value>]
          [--name-query <value>]
          [--path <value>]
          [--location-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --type (string)
          The type of API entities of the to-be-retrieved documentation parts.

          Possible values:

          o API

          o AUTHORIZER

          o MODEL

          o RESOURCE

          o METHOD

          o PATH_PARAMETER

          o QUERY_PARAMETER

          o REQUEST_HEADER

          o REQUEST_BODY

          o RESPONSE

          o RESPONSE_HEADER

          o RESPONSE_BODY

       --name-query (string)
          The name of API entities of the to-be-retrieved documentation parts.

       --path (string)
          The path of API entities of the to-be-retrieved documentation parts.

       --location-status (string)
          The status of the API documentation parts to retrieve. Valid  values
          are  DOCUMENTED for retrieving DocumentationPart resources with con-
          tent and UNDOCUMENTED for DocumentationPart resources  without  con-
          tent.

          Possible values:

          o DOCUMENTED

          o UNDOCUMENTED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              A documentation part for a targeted API entity.

              id -> (string)
                 The  DocumentationPart  identifier,  generated by API Gateway
                 when the DocumentationPart is created.

              location -> (structure)
                 The location of the API entity to which the documentation ap-
                 plies.  Valid  fields depend on the targeted API entity type.
                 All the valid location fields are not required.  If  not  ex-
                 plicitly  specified,  a  valid location field is treated as a
                 wildcard and associated documentation content may  be  inher-
                 ited by matching entities, unless overridden.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of API entity to which the documentation content
                     applies. Valid values are API , AUTHORIZER , MODEL ,  RE-
                     SOURCE  , METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAMETER , RE-
                     QUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE ,  RESPONSE_HEADER
                     ,  and RESPONSE_BODY . Content inheritance does not apply
                     to any entity of the API , AUTHORIZER , METHOD , MODEL  ,
                     REQUEST_BODY , or RESOURCE type.

                 path -> (string)
                     The  URL  path of the target. It is a valid field for the
                     API entity types of RESOURCE , METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER  ,
                     QUERY_PARAMETER  ,  REQUEST_HEADER  ,  REQUEST_BODY , RE-
                     SPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and RESPONSE_BODY  .  The  de-
                     fault  value is / for the root resource. When an applica-
                     ble child entity inherits the content of  another  entity
                     of  the same type with more general specifications of the
                     other location attributes, the child entity's path attri-
                     bute must match that of the parent entity as a prefix.

                 method -> (string)
                     The  HTTP  verb  of a method. It is a valid field for the
                     API entity types of METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER  ,  QUERY_PA-
                     RAMETER  , REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RE-
                     SPONSE_HEADER , and RESPONSE_BODY . The default value  is
                     *  for any method. When an applicable child entity inher-
                     its the content of an entity of the same type  with  more
                     general  specifications of the other location attributes,
                     the child entity's method attribute must  match  that  of
                     the parent entity exactly.

                 statusCode -> (string)
                     The  HTTP  status code of a response. It is a valid field
                     for the API entity types of RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER  ,
                     and RESPONSE_BODY . The default value is * for any status
                     code. When an applicable child entity inherits  the  con-
                     tent  of  an  entity  of  the same type with more general
                     specifications of  the  other  location  attributes,  the
                     child  entity's  statusCode  attribute must match that of
                     the parent entity exactly.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the targeted API entity. It is  a  valid  and
                     required  field  for the API entity types of AUTHORIZER ,
                     MODEL , PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAMETER , REQUEST_HEADER
                     ,  REQUEST_BODY  and  RESPONSE_HEADER  . It is an invalid
                     field for any other entity type.

              properties -> (string)
                 A content map of API-specific key-value pairs describing  the
                 targeted  API  entity.  The  map  must  be  encoded as a JSON
                 string, e.g., "{ \"description\": \"The API does ...\"  }"  .
                 Only  OpenAPI-compliant documentation-related fields from the
                 properties map are exported and, hence, published as part  of
                 the  API entity definitions, while the original documentation
                 parts are exported in a OpenAPI  extension  of  x-amazon-api-
                 gateway-documentation .
