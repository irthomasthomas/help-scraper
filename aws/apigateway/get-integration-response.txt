OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --resource-id (string)
          Specifies a get integration response request's resource identifier.

       --http-method (string)
          Specifies a get integration response request's HTTP method.

       --status-code (string)
          Specifies a get integration response request's status code.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the integration response configuration for a HTTP method defined
       under a REST API's resource

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-integration-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id y9h6rt --http-method GET --status-code 200

       Output:

          {
              "statusCode": "200",
              "responseTemplates": {
                  "application/json": null
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       statusCode -> (string)
          Specifies the status code that is used to map  the  integration  re-
          sponse to an existing MethodResponse.

       selectionPattern -> (string)
          Specifies  the  regular expression (regex) pattern used to choose an
          integration response based on the response from the  back  end.  For
          example,  if  the success response returns nothing and the error re-
          sponse returns some string, you could use the .+ regex to match  er-
          ror  response.  However,  make sure that the error response does not
          contain any newline (\n ) character in such cases. If the  back  end
          is  an  AWS Lambda function, the AWS Lambda function error header is
          matched. For all other HTTP and AWS back ends, the HTTP status  code
          is matched.

       responseParameters -> (map)
          A  key-value  map  specifying response parameters that are passed to
          the method response from the back end. The key is a method  response
          header  parameter  name  and  the mapped value is an integration re-
          sponse header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of single
          quotes, or a JSON expression from the integration response body. The
          mapping key must match the pattern of  method.response.header.{name}
          ,  where  name  is  a  valid  and  unique  header  name.  The mapped
          non-static  value  must  match  the   pattern   of   integration.re-
          sponse.header.{name}  or integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}
          , where name is a valid and unique response header name and JSON-ex-
          pression is a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       responseTemplates -> (map)
          Specifies  the  templates used to transform the integration response
          body. Response templates are represented as a key/value map, with  a
          content-type as the key and a template as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       contentHandling -> (string)
          Specifies  how  to handle response payload content type conversions.
          Supported values are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and  CONVERT_TO_TEXT  ,  with
          the following behaviors:

          If this property is not defined, the response payload will be passed
          through from the integration response to the method response without
          modification.
