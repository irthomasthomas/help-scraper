OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --resource-id (string)
          Specifies  an update integration response request's resource identi-
          fier.

       --http-method (string)
          Specifies an update integration response request's HTTP method.

       --status-code (string)
          Specifies an update integration response request's status code.

       --patch-operations (list)
          For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch Op-
          erations .

          (structure)
              For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch
              Operations .

              op -> (string)
                 An update operation to be performed with this PATCH  request.
                 The  valid value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not all
                 valid operations are supported for a given resource.  Support
                 of  the  operations depends on specific operational contexts.
                 Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will
                 return an error message..

              path -> (string)
                 The  op  operation's  target, as identified by a JSON Pointer
                 value that references a  location  within  the  targeted  re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property of {"name":"value"}, the path for this  property  is
                 /name.  If  the  name  property value is a JSON object (e.g.,
                 {"name": {"child/name": "child-value"}}), the  path  for  the
                 child/name  property  will  be  /name/child~1name.  Any slash
                 ("/") character appearing in path names must be escaped  with
                 "~1",  as  shown  in the example above. Each op operation can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The new target value of the update operation. It is  applica-
                 ble  for  the add or replace operation. When using AWS CLI to
                 update a property of a JSON value, enclose  the  JSON  object
                 with  a  pair of single quotes in a Linux shell, e.g., '{"a":
                 ...}'.

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer  value  referencing the location within the tar-
                 geted resource to copy the value from. For example,  to  pro-
                 mote  a  canary deployment, you copy the canary deployment ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a   Stage   resource  with  "op":"copy",  "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  change  an  integration response header to have a static mapping of
       '*'

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-integration-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id 3gapai --http-method GET --status-code 200 --patch-operations op='replace',path='/responseParameters/method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Origin',value='"'"'*'"'"'

       Output:

          {
              "statusCode": "200",
              "responseParameters": {
                  "method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "'*'"
              }
          }

       To remove an integration response header

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-integration-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id 3gapai --http-method GET --status-code 200 --patch-operations op='remove',path='/responseParameters/method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Origin'

OUTPUT
       statusCode -> (string)
          Specifies the status code that is used to map  the  integration  re-
          sponse to an existing MethodResponse.

       selectionPattern -> (string)
          Specifies  the  regular expression (regex) pattern used to choose an
          integration response based on the response from the  back  end.  For
          example,  if  the success response returns nothing and the error re-
          sponse returns some string, you could use the .+ regex to match  er-
          ror  response.  However,  make sure that the error response does not
          contain any newline (\n ) character in such cases. If the  back  end
          is  an Lambda function, the Lambda function error header is matched.
          For all other HTTP and Amazon Web Services back ends, the HTTP  sta-
          tus code is matched.

       responseParameters -> (map)
          A  key-value  map  specifying response parameters that are passed to
          the method response from the back end. The key is a method  response
          header  parameter  name  and  the mapped value is an integration re-
          sponse header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of single
          quotes, or a JSON expression from the integration response body. The
          mapping key must match the pattern of  method.response.header.{name}
          ,  where  name  is  a  valid  and  unique  header  name.  The mapped
          non-static  value  must  match  the   pattern   of   integration.re-
          sponse.header.{name}  or integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}
          , where name is a valid and unique response header name and JSON-ex-
          pression is a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       responseTemplates -> (map)
          Specifies  the  templates used to transform the integration response
          body. Response templates are represented as a key/value map, with  a
          content-type as the key and a template as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       contentHandling -> (string)
          Specifies  how  to handle response payload content type conversions.
          Supported values are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and  CONVERT_TO_TEXT  ,  with
          the following behaviors:

          If this property is not defined, the response payload will be passed
          through from the integration response to the method response without
          modification.
