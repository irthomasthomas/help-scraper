NAME
       get-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a Deployment resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-deployment
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --deployment-id <value>
          [--embed <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --deployment-id (string)
          The identifier of the Deployment resource to get information about.

       --embed (list)
          A  query  parameter  to retrieve the specified embedded resources of
          the returned Deployment resource in the  response.  In  a  REST  API
          call,  this  embed  parameter  value  is  a  list of comma-separated
          strings,  as  in   GET   /restapis/{restapi_id}/deployments/{deploy-
          ment_id}?embed=var1,var2  . The SDK and other platform-dependent li-
          braries might use a different format for the list.  Currently,  this
          request  supports  only  retrieval  of the embedded API summary this
          way. Hence, the parameter value must be a  single-valued  list  con-
          taining   only   the   "apisummary"   string.   For   example,   GET
          /restapis/{restapi_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}?embed=apisummary
          .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
