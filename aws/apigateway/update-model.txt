OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --model-name (string)
          The name of the model to update.

       --patch-operations (list)
          For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch Op-
          erations .

          (structure)
              For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch
              Operations .

              op -> (string)
                 An  update operation to be performed with this PATCH request.
                 The valid value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not  all
                 valid  operations are supported for a given resource. Support
                 of the operations depends on specific  operational  contexts.
                 Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will
                 return an error message..

              path -> (string)
                 The op operation's target, as identified by  a  JSON  Pointer
                 value  that  references  a  location  within the targeted re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property  of  {"name":"value"}, the path for this property is
                 /name. If the name property value is  a  JSON  object  (e.g.,
                 {"name":  {"child/name":  "child-value"}}),  the path for the
                 child/name property  will  be  /name/child~1name.  Any  slash
                 ("/")  character appearing in path names must be escaped with
                 "~1", as shown in the example above. Each  op  operation  can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The  new target value of the update operation. It is applica-
                 ble for the add or replace operation. When using AWS  CLI  to
                 update  a  property  of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object
                 with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell,  e.g.,  '{"a":
                 ...}'.

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer value referencing the location within  the  tar-
                 geted  resource  to copy the value from. For example, to pro-
                 mote a canary deployment, you copy the canary  deployment  ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a  Stage  resource  with   "op":"copy",   "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To change the description of a model in an API

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-model --rest-api-id 1234123412 --model-name 'Empty' --patch-operations op=replace,path=/description,value='New Description'

       To change the schema of a model in an API

          aws apigateway update-model --rest-api-id 1234123412 --model-name 'Empty' --patch-operations op=replace,path=/schema,value='"{ \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\", \"title\" : \"Empty Schema\", \"type\" : \"object\" }"'

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The identifier for the model resource.

       name -> (string)
          The name of the model. Must be an alphanumeric string.

       description -> (string)
          The description of the model.

       schema -> (string)
          The  schema  for the model. For application/json models, this should
          be JSON schema draft 4 model. Do not include "*/" characters in  the
          description  of  any  properties because such "*/" characters may be
          interpreted as the closing marker for comments  in  some  languages,
          such  as  Java or JavaScript, causing the installation of your API's
          SDK generated by API Gateway to fail.

       contentType -> (string)
          The content-type for the model.
