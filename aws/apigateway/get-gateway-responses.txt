GET-GATEWAY-RESPONSES()                                GET-GATEWAY-RESPONSES()



NAME
       get-gateway-responses -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  GatewayResponses  collection on the given RestApi. If an API
       developer has not added any definitions for gateway responses, the  re-
       sult will be the API Gateway-generated default GatewayResponses collec-
       tion for the supported response types.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-gateway-responses is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-gateway-responses
          --rest-api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          Returns the entire collection, because of no pagination support.

          (structure)
              A  gateway  response  of  a given response type and status code,
              with optional response parameters and mapping templates.

              responseType -> (string)
                 The response type of the associated GatewayResponse.

              statusCode -> (string)
                 The HTTP status code for this GatewayResponse.

              responseParameters -> (map)
                 Response parameters (paths, query strings and headers) of the
                 GatewayResponse as a string-to-string map of key-value pairs.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              responseTemplates -> (map)
                 Response    templates    of    the   GatewayResponse   as   a
                 string-to-string map of key-value pairs.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              defaultResponse -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean flag to indicate whether  this  GatewayResponse  is
                 the  default  gateway response (true ) or not (false ). A de-
                 fault gateway response is one generated by API Gateway  with-
                 out any customization by an API developer.
