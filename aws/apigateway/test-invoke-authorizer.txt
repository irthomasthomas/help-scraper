OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --authorizer-id (string)
          Specifies a test invoke authorizer request's Authorizer ID.

       --headers (map)
          A key-value map of headers to simulate an  incoming  invocation  re-
          quest.  This  is where the incoming authorization token, or identity
          source, should be specified.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --multi-value-headers (map)
          The headers as a map from string to list of values  to  simulate  an
          incoming  invocation  request. This is where the incoming authoriza-
          tion token, or identity source, may be specified.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --path-with-query-string (string)
          The URI path, including query string, of  the  simulated  invocation
          request. Use this to specify path parameters and query string param-
          eters.

       --body (string)
          The simulated request body of an incoming invocation request.

       --stage-variables (map)
          A key-value map of stage variables to simulate an  invocation  on  a
          deployed Stage.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --additional-context (map)
          A key-value map of additional context variables.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
