IMPORT-REST-API()                                            IMPORT-REST-API()



NAME
       import-rest-api -

DESCRIPTION
       A  feature  of  the  API Gateway control service for creating a new API
       from an external API definition file.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            import-rest-api
          [--fail-on-warnings | --no-fail-on-warnings]
          [--parameters <value>]
          --body <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fail-on-warnings | --no-fail-on-warnings (boolean)
          A query parameter to indicate whether to rollback the  API  creation
          (true  )  or not (false ) when a warning is encountered. The default
          value is false .

       --parameters (map)
          A key-value map of context-specific query string parameters specify-
          ing  the behavior of different API importing operations. The follow-
          ing shows operation-specific parameters and their supported values.

          To exclude DocumentationParts from the import, set parameters as ig-
          nore=documentation .

          To configure the endpoint type, set parameters as endpointConfigura-
          tionTypes=EDGE , endpointConfigurationTypes=REGIONAL , or  endpoint-
          ConfigurationTypes=PRIVATE . The default endpoint type is EDGE .

          To  handle  imported  basepath , set parameters as basepath=ignore ,
          basepath=prepend or basepath=split .

          For example, the AWS CLI command to exclude documentation  from  the
          imported API is:

          The AWS CLI command to set the regional endpoint on the imported API
          is:

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --body (blob)
          The POST request body  containing  external  API  definitions.  Cur-
          rently,  only  OpenAPI definition JSON/YAML files are supported. The
          maximum size of the API definition file is 6MB.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To import a Swagger template and create an API

       Command:

          aws apigateway import-rest-api --body 'file:///path/to/API_Swagger_template.json'

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The  API's  identifier. This identifier is unique across all of your
          APIs in API Gateway.

       name -> (string)
          The API's name.

       description -> (string)
          The API's description.

       createdDate -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp when the API was created.

       version -> (string)
          A version identifier for the API.

       warnings -> (list)
          The warning messages reported when failonwarnings is turned on  dur-
          ing API import.

          (string)

       binaryMediaTypes -> (list)
          The list of binary media types supported by the RestApi. By default,
          the RestApi supports only UTF-8-encoded text payloads.

          (string)

       minimumCompressionSize -> (integer)
          A nullable integer that is used to enable compression (with non-neg-
          ative between 0 and 10485760 (10M) bytes, inclusive) or disable com-
          pression (with a null value) on an API. When compression is enabled,
          compression  or  decompression  is not applied on the payload if the
          payload size is smaller than this value. Setting it to  zero  allows
          compression for any payload size.

       apiKeySource -> (string)
          The source of the API key for metering requests according to a usage
          plan. Valid values are: >``HEADER`` to read the  API  key  from  the
          X-API-Key  header  of a request. AUTHORIZER to read the API key from
          the UsageIdentifierKey from a custom authorizer.

       endpointConfiguration -> (structure)
          The endpoint configuration of  this  RestApi  showing  the  endpoint
          types of the API.

          types -> (list)
              A  list  of endpoint types of an API (RestApi) or its custom do-
              main name (DomainName). For an edge-optimized API and its custom
              domain  name,  the  endpoint type is "EDGE" . For a regional API
              and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is REGIONAL .  For
              a private API, the endpoint type is PRIVATE .

              (string)
                 The  endpoint  type. The valid values are EDGE for edge-opti-
                 mized API setup, most suitable for mobile  applications;  RE-
                 GIONAL  for  regional  API  endpoint setup, most suitable for
                 calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE for private APIs.

          vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
              A list of VpcEndpointIds of an API (RestApi)  against  which  to
              create  Route53  ALIASes.  It is only supported for PRIVATE end-
              point type.

              (string)

       policy -> (string)
          A stringified JSON policy document that applies to this RestApi  re-
          gardless of the caller and Method configuration.

       tags -> (map)
          The  collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a given
          resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       disableExecuteApiEndpoint -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether clients can invoke your API by using  the  default
          execute-api  endpoint.  By default, clients can invoke your API with
          the default https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com end-
          point.  To  require  that clients use a custom domain name to invoke
          your API, disable the default endpoint.
