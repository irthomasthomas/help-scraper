RESTORE-KEY()                                                    RESTORE-KEY()



NAME
       restore-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels  a  scheduled  key deletion during the waiting period. Use this
       operation to restore a Key that is scheduled for deletion.

       During the waiting period, the KeyState is DELETE_PENDING  and  delete-
       PendingTimestamp contains the date and time after which the Key will be
       deleted. After Key is restored, the KeyState is CREATE_COMPLETE  ,  and
       the value for deletePendingTimestamp is removed.
          Cross-account  use:  This  operation  can't be used across different
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

OPTIONS
       --key-identifier (string)
          The KeyARN of the key to be restored within Amazon Web Services Pay-
          ment Cryptography.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          KeyCheckValue -> (string)
              The  key check value (KCV) is used to check if all parties hold-
              ing a given key have the same key or to detect that  a  key  has
              changed. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography calculates the
              KCV by using standard algorithms, typically by encrypting  8  or
              16  bytes  or "00" or "01" and then truncating the result to the
              first 3 bytes, or 6 hex digits, of the resulting cryptogram.

          KeyCheckValueAlgorithm -> (string)
              The algorithm used for calculating key check value (KCV) for DES
              and  AES  keys. For a DES key, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryp-
              tography computes the KCV by encrypting 8 bytes, each with value
              '00', with the key to be checked and retaining the 3 highest or-
              der bytes of the encrypted result. For an AES  key,  Amazon  Web
              Services  Payment  Cryptography computes the KCV by encrypting 8
              bytes, each with value '01', with the key to be checked and  re-
              taining the 3 highest order bytes of the encrypted result.

          KeyOrigin -> (string)
              The  source  of the key material. For keys created within Amazon
              Web  Services  Payment  Cryptography,  the  value  is   AWS_PAY-
              MENT_CRYPTOGRAPHY  .  For keys imported into Amazon Web Services
              Payment Cryptography, the value is EXTERNAL .

          KeyState -> (string)
              The state of key that is being created or deleted.

          UsageStartTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment  Cryp-
              tography will start using the key material for cryptographic op-
              erations.

          UsageStopTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment  Cryp-
              tography  will stop using the key material for cryptographic op-
              erations.
