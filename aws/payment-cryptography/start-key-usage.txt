       active for cryptographic operations within Amazon Web Services  Payment
       Cryptography
          Cross-account  use:  This  operation  can't be used across different
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

SYNOPSIS
            start-key-usage
          --key-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-identifier (string)
          The KeyArn of the key.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 The  cryptographic  usage  of  an Amazon Web Services Payment
                 Cryptography key as dened in section A.5.2 of the TR-31 spec.

          KeyCheckValue -> (string)
              The key check value (KCV) is used to check if all parties  hold-
              ing  a  given  key have the same key or to detect that a key has
              changed.

          KeyCheckValueAlgorithm -> (string)
              The algorithm that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses
              to  calculate  the key check value (KCV). It is used to validate
              the key integrity.

              For TDES keys, the KCV is computed by encrypting 8  bytes,  each
              with value of zero, with the key to be checked and retaining the
              3 highest order bytes of the encrypted result. For AES keys, the
              KCV  is  computed using a CMAC algorithm where the input data is
              16 bytes of zero and retaining the 3 highest order bytes of  the
              encrypted result.

          KeyOrigin -> (string)
              The  source  of the key material. For keys created within Amazon
              Web  Services  Payment  Cryptography,  the  value  is   AWS_PAY-
              MENT_CRYPTOGRAPHY  .  For keys imported into Amazon Web Services
              Payment Cryptography, the value is EXTERNAL .

          KeyState -> (string)
              The state of key that is being created or deleted.

          UsageStartTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment  Cryp-
              tography will start using the key material for cryptographic op-
              erations.

          UsageStopTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment  Cryp-
              tography  will stop using the key material for cryptographic op-
              erations.
