EXPORT-KEY()                                                      EXPORT-KEY()



NAME
       export-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports a key from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.

       Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography simplifies key exchange by re-
       placing the existing paper-based approach with a modern electronic  ap-
       proach.  With ExportKey you can export symmetric keys using either sym-
       metric and asymmetric key exchange mechanisms.  Using  this  operation,
       you  can  share your Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography generated
       keys with other service partners to  perform  cryptographic  operations
       outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography

       For  symmetric  key  exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
       uses the ANSI X9 TR-31 norm in accordance with PCI PIN guidelines.  And
       for  asymmetric  key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
       supports ANSI X9 TR-34 norm and RSA wrap and unwrap key exchange mecha-
       nism.  Asymmetric  key exchange methods are typically used to establish
       bi-directional trust between the two parties  exhanging  keys  and  are
       used  for  initial key exchange such as Key Encryption Key (KEK). After
       which you can export working keys using  symmetric  method  to  perform
       various  cryptographic  operations  within  Amazon Web Services Payment
       Cryptography.

       The TR-34 norm is intended for exchanging 3DES keys only and  keys  are
       imported in a WrappedKeyBlock format. Key attributes (such as KeyUsage,
       KeyAlgorithm, KeyModesOfUse, Exportability) are  contained  within  the
       key  block.  With  RSA  wrap and unwrap, you can exchange both 3DES and
       AES-128 keys. The keys are imported in  a  WrappedKeyCryptogram  format
       and you will need to specify the key attributes during import.

       You can also use ExportKey functionality to generate and export an IPEK
       (Initial Pin Encryption Key) from Amazon Web Services Payment  Cryptog-
       raphy  using  either TR-31 or TR-34 export key exchange. IPEK is gener-
       ated from BDK (Base Derivation Key) and ExportDukptInitialKey attribute
       KSN (KeySerialNumber ). The generated IPEK does not persist within Ama-
       zon Web Services Payment Cryptography and has to be  re-generated  each
       time during export.

       For  key  exchange using TR-31 or TR-34 key blocks, you can also export
       optional blocks within the key block header  which  contain  additional
       attribute  information  about  the key. The KeyVersion within KeyBlock-
       Headers indicates the version of the key within the key block. Further-
       more,  KeyExportability  within  KeyBlockHeaders can be used to further
       restrict exportability of the key after export from Amazon Web Services
       Payment Cryptography.

       The  OptionalBlocks contain the additional data related to the key. For
       information on data type that can be included within  optional  blocks,
       refer to ASC X9.143-2022 .

       NOTE:
              Data  included in key block headers is signed but transmitted in
              clear text. Sensitive or confidential information should not  be
              included  in  optional blocks. Refer to ASC X9.143-2022 standard
              for information on allowed data type.

          To export initial keys (KEK) or IPEK using TR-34

       Using this operation, you can export initial key using TR-34 asymmetric
       key  exchange. You can only export KEK generated within Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Payment Cryptography. In TR-34 terminology, the sending party  of
       the  key  is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party
       of the key is called Key Receiving  Device  (KRD).  During  key  export
       process,  KDH  is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography which initi-
       ates key export and KRD is the user receiving the key.

       To initiate TR-34 key export, the KRD must obtain an  export  token  by
       calling  GetParametersForExport  .  This operation also generates a key
       pair for the purpose of key export, signs the key and returns back  the
       signing  public key certificate (also known as KDH signing certificate)
       and root certificate chain. The KDH uses the private key  to  sign  the
       the  export  payload and the signing public key certificate is provided
       to KRD to verify the signature. The KRD can import the root certificate
       into  its Hardware Security Module (HSM), as required. The export token
       and the associated KDH signing certificate expires after 7 days.

       Next the KRD generates a key pair for the the purpose of encrypting the
       KDH key and provides the public key cerificate (also known as KRD wrap-
       ping certificate) back to KDH. The KRD will also import the  root  cer-
       ificate  chain into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling
       ImportKey for RootCertificatePublicKey . The KDH, Amazon  Web  Services
       Payment  Cryptography,  will use the KRD wrapping cerificate to encrypt
       (wrap) the key under export and signs it with signing  private  key  to
       generate a TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock. For more information on TR-34 key ex-
       port, see section Exporting symmetric keys in the Amazon  Web  Services
       Payment Cryptography User Guide .

       Set the following parameters:

       o ExportAttributes  : Specify export attributes in case of IPEK export.
         This parameter is optional for KEK export.

       o ExportKeyIdentifier : The KeyARN of the KEK or BDK (in case of  IPEK)
         under export.

       o KeyMaterial : Use Tr34KeyBlock parameters.

       o CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier  : The KeyARN of the certifi-
         cate chain that signed the KRD wrapping key certificate.

       o ExportToken : Obtained from KDH by calling GetParametersForImport .

       o WrappingKeyCertificate : The public key  certificate  in  PEM  format
         (base64  encoded) of the KRD wrapping key Amazon Web Services Payment
         Cryptography uses for encryption of the TR-34  export  payload.  This
         certificate  must  be  signed by the root certificate (CertificateAu-
         thorityPublicKeyIdentifier) imported into Amazon Web Services Payment
         Cryptography.

       When this operation is successful, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptog-
       raphy returns the KEK or IPEK as a TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock.
          To export initial keys (KEK) or IPEK using RSA Wrap and Unwrap

       Using this operation, you can export initial key using  asymmetric  RSA
       wrap  and  unwrap  key exchange method. To initiate export, generate an
       asymmetric key pair on the receiving HSM and obtain the public key cer-
       tificate in PEM format (base64 encoded) for the purpose of wrapping and
       the root certifiate chain. Import the root certificate into Amazon  Web
       Services  Payment  Cryptography  by  calling ImportKey for RootCertifi-
       catePublicKey .

       Next call ExportKey and set the following parameters:

       o CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier : The KeyARN of the  certifi-
         cate chain that signed wrapping key certificate.

       o KeyMaterial : Set to KeyCryptogram .

       o WrappingKeyCertificate  :  The  public  key certificate in PEM format
         (base64 encoded) obtained by the receiving HSM and signed by the root
         certificate  (CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier)  imported into
         Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The receiving HSM uses  its
         private key component to unwrap the WrappedKeyCryptogram.

       When this operation is successful, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptog-
       raphy returns the WrappedKeyCryptogram.
          To export working keys or IPEK using TR-31

       Using this operation, you can export working keys or IPEK  using  TR-31
       symmetric  key  exchange. In TR-31, you must use an initial key such as
       KEK to encrypt or wrap the key under export. To establish  a  KEK,  you
       can use CreateKey or ImportKey .

       Set the following parameters:

       o ExportAttributes  : Specify export attributes in case of IPEK export.
         This parameter is optional for KEK export.

       o ExportKeyIdentifier : The KeyARN of the KEK or BDK (in case of  IPEK)
         under export.

       o KeyMaterial : Use Tr31KeyBlock parameters.

       When this operation is successful, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptog-
       raphy returns the working key or IPEK as a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock.
          Cross-account use: This operation can't  be  used  across  different
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

                     ceiver under a KEK using TR-31, TR-34, RSA wrap  and  un-
                     wrap  cryptogram  or using a symmetric cryptogram key ex-
                     port  method.  For  further  information  refer  to  ANSI
                     X9.143-2022 .

                 KeyVersion -> (string)
                     Parameter used to indicate the version of the key carried
                     in the key block or indicate the value carried in the key
                     block is a component of a key.

                 OptionalBlocks -> (map)
                     Parameter  used  to indicate the type of optional data in
                     key block headers. Refer to ANSI X9.143-2022 for informa-
                     tion on allowed data type for optional blocks.

                     Optional  block  character  limit  is 112 characters. For
                     each optional block, 2 characters are  reserved  for  op-
                     tional  block  ID  and 2 characters reserved for optional
                     block length. More than one optional blocks  can  be  in-
                     cluded  as  long as the combined length does not increase
                     112 characters.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

          KeyCryptogram -> (structure)

       --export-key-identifier (string)
          The KeyARN of the key under export from Amazon Web Services  Payment
          Cryptography.

       --export-attributes (structure)
          The attributes for IPEK generation during export.

          ExportDukptInitialKey -> (structure)
              Parameter information for IPEK export.

              KeySerialNumber -> (string)
                 The KSN for IPEK generation using DUKPT.

                 KSN must be padded before sending to Amazon Web Services Pay-
                 ment  Cryptography.  KSN  hex  length  should  be  20  for  a
                 TDES_2KEY key or 24 for an AES key.

          KeyCheckValueAlgorithm -> (string)
              The algorithm that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses
              to calculate the key check value (KCV). It is used  to  validate
              the key integrity. Specify KCV for IPEK export only.

              For  TDES  keys, the KCV is computed by encrypting 8 bytes, each
              with value of zero, with the key to be checked and retaining the
              3 highest order bytes of the encrypted result. For AES keys, the
              KCV is computed using a CMAC algorithm where the input  data  is
              16  bytes of zero and retaining the 3 highest order bytes of the
              encrypted result.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ExportDukptInitialKey={KeySerialNumber=string},KeyCheckValueAlgorithm=string

       JSON Syntax:

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       WrappedKey -> (structure)
          The key material under export as a TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock or a  TR-31
          WrappedKeyBlock. or a RSA WrappedKeyCryptogram.

          WrappingKeyArn -> (string)
              The KeyARN of the wrapped key.

          WrappedKeyMaterialFormat -> (string)
              The key block format of a wrapped key.

          KeyMaterial -> (string)
              Parameter  information  for generating a wrapped key using TR-31
              or TR-34 skey exchange method.

          KeyCheckValue -> (string)
              The key check value (KCV) is used to check if all parties  hold-
              ing  a  given  key have the same key or to detect that a key has
              changed.

          KeyCheckValueAlgorithm -> (string)
              The algorithm that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses
              to  calculate  the key check value (KCV). It is used to validate
              the key integrity.

              For TDES keys, the KCV is computed by encrypting 8  bytes,  each
              with value of zero, with the key to be checked and retaining the
              3 highest order bytes of the encrypted result. For AES keys, the
              KCV  is  computed using a CMAC algorithm where the input data is
              16 bytes of zero and retaining the 3 highest order bytes of  the
              encrypted result.
