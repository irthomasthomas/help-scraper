IMPORT-KEY()                                                      IMPORT-KEY()



NAME
       import-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports  symmetric  keys  and  public  key  certificates  in PEM format
       (base64 encoded) into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.

       Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography simplifies key exchange by re-
       placing  the existing paper-based approach with a modern electronic ap-
       proach. With ImportKey you can import symmetric keys using either  sym-
       metric and asymmetric key exchange mechanisms.

       For  symmetric  key  exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
       uses the ANSI X9 TR-31 norm in accordance with PCI PIN guidelines.  And
       for  asymmetric  key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
       supports ANSI X9 TR-34 norm and RSA wrap and unwrap key exchange mecha-
       nisms.  Asymmetric key exchange methods are typically used to establish
       bi-directional trust between the two parties  exhanging  keys  and  are
       used  for initial key exchange such as Key Encryption Key (KEK) or Zone
       Master Key (ZMK). After which you can import working keys using symmet-
       ric  method  to  perform various cryptographic operations within Amazon
       Web Services Payment Cryptography.

       The TR-34 norm is intended for exchanging 3DES keys only and  keys  are
       imported in a WrappedKeyBlock format. Key attributes (such as KeyUsage,
       KeyAlgorithm, KeyModesOfUse, Exportability) are  contained  within  the
       key  block.  With  RSA  wrap and unwrap, you can exchange both 3DES and
       AES-128 keys. The keys are imported in  a  WrappedKeyCryptogram  format
       and you will need to specify the key attributes during import.

       You  can also import a root public key certificate , used to sign other
       public key certificates, or a trusted public key certificate  under  an
       already established root public key certificate.
          To import a public root key certificate

       You  can also import a root public key certificate , used to sign other
       public key certificates, or a trusted public key certificate  under  an
       already established root public key certificate.
          To import a public root key certificate

       Using  this operation, you can import the public component (in PEM cer-
       ificate format) of your private root key. You can use the imported pub-
       lic  root  key  certificate for digital signatures, for example signing
       wrapping key or signing key in TR-34, within your Amazon  Web  Services
       Payment Cryptography account.

       Set the following parameters:

       o KeyMaterial : RootCertificatePublicKey

       o KeyClass : PUBLIC_KEY

       o KeyModesOfUse : Verify

       o KeyUsage : TR31_S0_ASYMMETRIC_KEY_FOR_DIGITAL_SIGNATURE

       o PublicKeyCertificate  :  The  public  key  certificate  in PEM format
         (base64 encoded) of the private root key under import.
          To import a trusted public key certificate

       The root public key certificate must be in place and operational before
       you  import a trusted public key certificate. Set the following parame-
       ters:

       o KeyMaterial : TrustedCertificatePublicKey

       o CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier : KeyArn of the  RootCertifi-
         catePublicKey .

       o KeyModesOfUse and KeyUsage : Corresponding to the cryptographic oper-
         ations such as wrap, sign, or encrypt that you will allow the trusted
         public key certificate to perform.

       o PublicKeyCertificate : The trusted public key certificate in PEM for-
         mat (base64 encoded) under import.
          To import initial keys (KEK or ZMK or similar) using TR-34

       Using this operation, you can import initial key using TR-34 asymmetric
       key  exchange.  In  TR-34  terminology, the sending party of the key is
       called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party of  the  key
       is  called  Key  Receiving Device (KRD). During the key import process,
       KDH is the user who initiates the key import and KRD is Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Payment Cryptography who receives the key.

       To  initiate  TR-34  key import, the KDH must obtain an import token by
       calling GetParametersForImport . This operation generates an encryption
       keypair  for  the purpose of key import, signs the key and returns back
       the wrapping key certificate (also known as KRD  wrapping  certificate)
       and  the root certificate chain. The KDH must trust and install the KRD
       wrapping certificate on its HSM and use it to encrypt  (wrap)  the  KDH
       key during TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock generation. The import token and asso-
       ciated KRD wrapping certificate expires after 7 days.

       Next the KDH generates a key pair for the purpose of  signing  the  en-
       crypted  KDH key and provides the public certificate of the signing key
       to Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The KDH will also need  to
       import  the  root  certificate  chain of the KDH signing certificate by
       calling ImportKey for RootCertificatePublicKey . For  more  information
       on TR-34 key import, see section Importing symmetric keys in the Amazon
       Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide .

       Set the following parameters:

       o KeyMaterial : Use Tr34KeyBlock parameters.

       o CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier : The KeyARN of the  certifi-
         cate chain that signed the KDH signing key certificate.

       o ImportToken : Obtained from KRD by calling GetParametersForImport .

       o WrappedKeyBlock  :  The  TR-34 wrapped key material from KDH. It con-
         tains the KDH key under import, wrapped with KRD wrapping certificate
         and  signed by KDH signing private key. This TR-34 key block is typi-
         cally generated by the KDH Hardware Security Module (HSM) outside  of
         Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.

       o SigningKeyCertificate  :  The  public  key  certificate in PEM format
         (base64 encoded) of the KDH signing key generated under the root cer-
         tificate (CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier) imported in Amazon
         Web Services Payment Cryptography.
          To import initial keys (KEK or ZMK or similar) using  RSA  Wrap  and
          Unwrap

       Using  this  operation, you can import initial key using asymmetric RSA
       wrap  and  unwrap  key  exchange  method.  To  initiate  import,   call
       GetParametersForImport with KeyMaterial set to KEY_CRYPTOGRAM to gener-
       ate an import token. This operation also generates an  encryption  key-
       pair  for the purpose of key import, signs the key and returns back the
       wrapping key certificate in PEM format (base64 encoded)  and  its  root
       certificate  chain.  The  import token and associated KRD wrapping cer-
       tificate expires after 7 days.

       You must trust and install the wrapping certificate and its certificate
       chain  on  the  sending HSM and use it to wrap the key under export for
       WrappedKeyCryptogram generation. Next call ImportKey  with  KeyMaterial
       set to KEY_CRYPTOGRAM and provide the ImportToken and KeyAttributes for
       the key under import.
          To import working keys using TR-31

       Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses TR-31 symmetric  key  ex-
       change  norm  to  import working keys. A KEK must be established within
       Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by using TR-34 key  import  or
       by  using CreateKey . To initiate a TR-31 key import, set the following
       parameters:

       o KeyMaterial : Use Tr31KeyBlock parameters.

       o WrappedKeyBlock : The TR-31 wrapped key material. It contains the key
         under  import,  encrypted using KEK. The TR-31 key block is typically
         generated by a HSM outside of Amazon Web Services Payment  Cryptogra-
         phy.

       o WrappingKeyIdentifier  :  The  KeyArn of the KEK that Amazon Web Ser-
         vices Payment Cryptography uses to decrypt or unwrap  the  key  under
         import.
          Cross-account  use:  This  operation  can't be used across different
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

       --key-check-value-algorithm (string)
          The  algorithm that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses to
          calculate the key check value (KCV). It is used to validate the  key
          integrity.

          For  TDES keys, the KCV is computed by encrypting 8 bytes, each with
          value of zero, with the key to be checked and retaining the 3  high-
          est  order  bytes  of the encrypted result. For AES keys, the KCV is
          computed using a CMAC algorithm where the input data is 16 bytes  of
          zero  and  retaining  the 3 highest order bytes of the encrypted re-
          sult.

          Possible values:

          o CMAC

          o ANSI_X9_24

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether import key is enabled.

       --tags (list)
          Assigns one or more tags to the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptog-
          raphy  key.  Use this parameter to tag a key when it is imported. To
          tag an existing Amazon Web Services Payment  Cryptography  key,  use
          the TagResource operation.

          Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and
          the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null)
          string.  You  can't have more than one tag on an Amazon Web Services
          Payment Cryptography key with the same tag key. If  you  specify  an
          existing  tag  key  with  a different tag value, Amazon Web Services
          Payment Cryptography replaces the current tag value with the  speci-
          fied one.

          WARNING:
              Don't include personal, confidential or sensitive information in
              this field. This field may be displayed in plaintext  in  Cloud-
              Trail logs and other output.

          NOTE:
              Tagging or untagging an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
              key can allow or deny permission to the key.

          (structure)
              A structure that contains information about a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

                     phy  key  has  no special restrictions other than the re-
                     strictions implied by KeyUsage .

          KeyCheckValue -> (string)
              The key check value (KCV) is used to check if all parties  hold-
              ing  a  given  key have the same key or to detect that a key has
              changed.

          KeyCheckValueAlgorithm -> (string)
              The algorithm that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses
              to  calculate  the key check value (KCV). It is used to validate
              the key integrity.

              For TDES keys, the KCV is computed by encrypting 8  bytes,  each
              with value of zero, with the key to be checked and retaining the
              3 highest order bytes of the encrypted result. For AES keys, the
              KCV  is  computed using a CMAC algorithm where the input data is
              16 bytes of zero and retaining the 3 highest order bytes of  the
              encrypted result.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the key is enabled.

          Exportable -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether the key is exportable. This data is immutable
              after the key is created.

          KeyState -> (string)
              The state of key that is being created or deleted.

          KeyOrigin -> (string)
              The source of the key material. For keys created  within  Amazon
              Web   Services  Payment  Cryptography,  the  value  is  AWS_PAY-
              MENT_CRYPTOGRAPHY . For keys imported into Amazon  Web  Services
              Payment Cryptography, the value is EXTERNAL .

          CreateTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the key was created.

          UsageStartTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment Cryp-
              tography will start using the key material for cryptographic op-
              erations.

          UsageStopTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment Cryp-
              tography will stop using the key material for cryptographic  op-
              erations.

          DeletePendingTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment Cryp-
              tography will delete the key. This value is  present  only  when
              KeyState  is  DELETE_PENDING  and the key is scheduled for dele-
              tion.

          DeleteTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment  Cryp-
              tography  will  delete  the key. This value is present only when
              when the KeyState is DELETE_COMPLETE and the Amazon Web Services
              Payment Cryptography key is deleted.



                                                                  IMPORT-KEY()
