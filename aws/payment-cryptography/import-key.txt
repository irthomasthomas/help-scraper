NAME
       import-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports  keys and public key certificates into Amazon Web Services Pay-
       ment Cryptography.

       Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography simplifies main  or  root  key
       exchange  process by eliminating the need of a paper-based key exchange
       process. It takes a modern and secure approach based  of  the  ANSI  X9
       TR-34 key exchange standard.

       You  can use ImportKey to import main or root keys such as KEK (Key En-
       cryption Key) using asymmetric key  exchange  technique  following  the
       ANSI X9 TR-34 standard. The ANSI X9 TR-34 standard uses asymmetric keys
       to establishes bi-directional trust between the two parties  exchanging
       keys.

       After you have imported a main or root key, you can import working keys
       to perform various cryptographic operations within Amazon Web  Services
       Payment  Cryptography  using  the  ANSI X9 TR-31 symmetric key exchange
       standard as mandated by PCI PIN.

       You can also import a root public key certificate , a self-signed  cer-
       tificate  used to sign other public key certificates, or a trusted pub-
       lic key certificate under an already established root public  key  cer-
       tificate.
          To import a public root key certificate

       Using  this operation, you can import the public component (in PEM cer-
       ificate format) of your private root key. You can use the imported pub-
       lic  root  key  certificate for digital signatures, for example signing
       wrapping key or signing key in TR-34, within your Amazon  Web  Services
       Payment Cryptography account.

       Set the following parameters:

       o KeyMaterial : RootCertificatePublicKey

       o KeyClass : PUBLIC_KEY

       o KeyModesOfUse : Verify

       o KeyUsage : TR31_S0_ASYMMETRIC_KEY_FOR_DIGITAL_SIGNATURE

       o PublicKeyCertificate  :  The  certificate  authority used to sign the
         root public key certificate.
          To import a trusted public key certificate

       The root public key certificate must be in place and operational before
       you  import a trusted public key certificate. Set the following parame-
       ters:

       o KeyMaterial : TrustedCertificatePublicKey

       o CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier : KeyArn of the  RootCertifi-
         catePublicKey .

       o KeyModesOfUse and KeyUsage : Corresponding to the cryptographic oper-
         ations such as wrap, sign, or encrypt that you will allow the trusted
         public key certificate to perform.

       o PublicKeyCertificate  :  The  certificate  authority used to sign the
         trusted public key certificate.
          Import main keys

       Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses TR-34 asymmetric key  ex-
       change  standard to import main keys such as KEK. In TR-34 terminology,
       the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH)  and
       the receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Host (KRH). Dur-
       ing the key import process, KDH is the user who initiates the  key  im-
       port  and  KRH is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography who receives
       the key. Before initiating TR-34 key import, you must obtain an  import
       token  by calling  GetParametersForImport . This operation also returns
       the wrapping key certificate that KDH uses wrap  key  under  import  to
       generate  a  TR-34  wrapped key block. The import token expires after 7
       days.

       Set the following parameters:

       o CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier : The KeyArn of the  certifi-
         cate  chain that will sign the signing key certificate and should ex-
         ist within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography before initiating
         TR-34  key import. If it does not exist, you can import it by calling
         by calling ImportKey for RootCertificatePublicKey .

       o ImportToken : Obtained from KRH by calling  GetParametersForImport .

       o WrappedKeyBlock : The TR-34 wrapped key block from KDH.  It  contains
         the KDH key under import, wrapped with KRH provided wrapping key cer-
         tificate and signed by the KDH private signing key.  This  TR-34  key
         block  is generated by the KDH Hardware Security Module (HSM) outside
         of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.

       o SigningKeyCertificate : The public component of the private key  that
         signed the KDH TR-34 wrapped key block. In PEM certificate format.

       NOTE:
              TR-34  is intended primarily to exchange 3DES keys. Your ability
              to export AES-128 and larger AES keys may be dependent  on  your
              source system.

          Import working keys

       Amazon  Web  Services Payment Cryptography uses TR-31 symmetric key ex-
       change standard to import working  keys.  A  KEK  must  be  established
       within  Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by using TR-34 key im-
       port. To initiate a TR-31 key import, set the following parameters:

       o WrappedKeyBlock : The key under import and encrypted using  KEK.  The
         TR-31  key block generated by your HSM outside of Amazon Web Services
         Payment Cryptography.

       o WrappingKeyIdentifier : The KeyArn of the KEK that  Amazon  Web  Ser-
         vices  Payment  Cryptography  uses to decrypt or unwrap the key under
         import.
          Cross-account use: This operation can't  be  used  across  different
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

OPTIONS
       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether import key is enabled.

       --key-check-value-algorithm (string)
          The  algorithm that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses to
          calculate the key check value (KCV) for DES and AES keys.

          For DES key, the KCV is computed by encrypting 8  bytes,  each  with
          value  '00',  with the key to be checked and retaining the 3 highest
          order bytes of the encrypted result. For AES key, the  KCV  is  com-
          puted  by  encrypting 8 bytes, each with value '01', with the key to
          be checked and retaining the 3 highest order bytes of the  encrypted
          result.

          Possible values:

          o CMAC

          o ANSI_X9_24

       --tags (list)
          The tags to attach to the key. Each tag consists of a tag key and  a
          tag  value. Both the tag key and the tag value are required, but the
          tag value can be an empty (null) string. You can't  have  more  than
          one  tag on an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key with the
          same tag key.

          You can't have more than one tag on an Amazon Web  Services  Payment
          Cryptography  key  with the same tag key. If you specify an existing
          tag key with a different tag  value,  Amazon  Web  Services  Payment
          Cryptography replaces the current tag value with the specified one.

          To use this parameter, you must have TagResource permission.

          WARNING:
              Don't  include  confidential  or  sensitive  information in this
              field. This field may be displayed in  plaintext  in  CloudTrail
              logs and other output.

          NOTE:
              Tagging or untagging an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
              key can allow or deny permission to the key.

          (structure)
              A structure that contains information about a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          KeyCheckValue -> (string)
              The key check value (KCV) is used to check if all parties  hold-
              ing  a  given  key have the same key or to detect that a key has
              changed. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography calculates the
              KCV  by  using standard algorithms, typically by encrypting 8 or
              16 bytes or "00" or "01" and then truncating the result  to  the
              first 3 bytes, or 6 hex digits, of the resulting cryptogram.

          KeyCheckValueAlgorithm -> (string)
              The algorithm used for calculating key check value (KCV) for DES
              and AES keys. For a DES key, Amazon Web Services  Payment  Cryp-
              tography computes the KCV by encrypting 8 bytes, each with value
              '00', with the key to be checked and retaining the 3 highest or-
              der  bytes  of  the encrypted result. For an AES key, Amazon Web
              Services Payment Cryptography computes the KCV by  encrypting  8
              bytes,  each with value '01', with the key to be checked and re-
              taining the 3 highest order bytes of the encrypted result.

          KeyOrigin -> (string)
              The source of the key material. For keys created  within  Amazon
              Web   Services  Payment  Cryptography,  the  value  is  AWS_PAY-
              MENT_CRYPTOGRAPHY . For keys imported into Amazon  Web  Services
              Payment Cryptography, the value is EXTERNAL .

          KeyState -> (string)
              The state of key that is being created or deleted.

          UsageStartTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment Cryp-
              tography will start using the key material for cryptographic op-
              erations.

          UsageStopTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment Cryp-
              tography will stop using the key material for cryptographic  op-
              erations.
