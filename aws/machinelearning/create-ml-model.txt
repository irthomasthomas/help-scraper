CREATE-ML-MODEL()                                            CREATE-ML-MODEL()



NAME
       create-ml-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new MLModel using the DataSource and the recipe as informa-
       tion sources.

       An MLModel is nearly immutable. Users can update only  the  MLModelName
       and the ScoreThreshold in an MLModel without creating a new MLModel .
          CreateMLModel  is  an  asynchronous  operation.  In response to Cre-
          ateMLModel , Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns
          and  sets the MLModel status to PENDING . After the MLModel has been
          created and ready is for use, Amazon ML sets the status to COMPLETED
          .

       You  can  use  the  GetMLModel  operation  to check the progress of the
       MLModel during the creation operation.
          CreateMLModel requires a DataSource with computed statistics,  which
          can  be  created by setting ComputeStatistics to true in CreateData-
          SourceFromRDS , CreateDataSourceFromS3 , or CreateDataSourceFromRed-
          shift operations.

OPTIONS
       --ml-model-id (string)
          A user-supplied ID that uniquely identifies the MLModel .

       --ml-model-name (string)
          A user-supplied name or description of the MLModel .

       --ml-model-type (string)
          The  category of supervised learning that this MLModel will address.
          Choose from the following types:

          o Choose REGRESSION if the MLModel will be used to predict a numeric
            value.

          o Choose BINARY if the MLModel result has two possible values.

          o Choose  MULTICLASS  if  the MLModel result has a limited number of
            values.

          For more information, see  the  Amazon  Machine  Learning  Developer
          Guide .

          Possible values:

          o REGRESSION

          o BINARY

          o MULTICLASS

       --parameters (map)
          A  list  of the training parameters in the MLModel . The list is im-
          plemented as a map of key-value pairs.

          The following is the current set of training parameters:

          o sgd.maxMLModelSizeInBytes - The maximum allowed size of the model.
            Depending  on  the  input data, the size of the model might affect
            its performance. The value is an integer that ranges  from  100000
            to 2147483648 . The default value is 33554432 .

          o sgd.maxPasses - The number of times that the training process tra-
            verses the observations to build the MLModel . The value is an in-
            teger that ranges from 1 to 10000 . The default value is 10 .

          o sgd.shuffleType  -  Whether  Amazon ML shuffles the training data.
            Shuffling the data improves a model's ability to find the  optimal
            solution  for  a  variety of data types. The valid values are auto
            and none . The default value is none . We strongly recommend  that
            you shuffle your data.

          o sgd.l1RegularizationAmount  -  The  coefficient  regularization L1
            norm. It controls overfitting the data by penalizing large coeffi-
            cients.  This  tends to drive coefficients to zero, resulting in a
            sparse feature set. If you use this parameter, start by specifying
            a small value, such as 1.0E-08 . The value is a double that ranges
            from 0 to MAX_DOUBLE . The default is to not use L1 normalization.
            This parameter can't be used when L2 is specified. Use this param-
            eter sparingly.

          o sgd.l2RegularizationAmount -  The  coefficient  regularization  L2
            norm. It controls overfitting the data by penalizing large coeffi-
            cients. This tends to drive coefficients to small, nonzero values.
            If you use this parameter, start by specifying a small value, such
            as 1.0E-08 . The value is a double that ranges from 0 to  MAX_DOU-
            BLE  .  The default is to not use L2 normalization. This parameter
            can't be used when L1 is specified. Use this parameter sparingly.

          key -> (string)
              String type.

          value -> (string)
              String type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --training-data-source-id (string)
          The DataSource that points to the training data.

       --recipe (string)
          The data recipe for creating the MLModel . You must  specify  either
          the  recipe  or  its  URI. If you don't specify a recipe or its URI,
          Amazon ML creates a default.

       --recipe-uri (string)
          The Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location and file name
          that contains the MLModel recipe. You must specify either the recipe
          or its URI. If you don't specify a recipe or its URI, Amazon ML cre-
          ates a default.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       MLModelId -> (string)
          A user-supplied ID that uniquely identifies the MLModel . This value
          should be identical to the value of the MLModelId in the request.
