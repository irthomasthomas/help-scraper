CREATE-REALTIME-ENDPOINT()                          CREATE-REALTIME-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       create-realtime-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  real-time  endpoint for the MLModel . The endpoint contains
       the URI of the MLModel ; that is, the location to send  real-time  pre-
       diction requests for the specified MLModel .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

SYNOPSIS

          --ml-model-id <value>

          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ml-model-id (string)
          The ID assigned to the MLModel during creation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       MLModelId -> (string)
          A user-supplied ID that uniquely identifies the MLModel . This value
          should be identical to the value of the MLModelId in the request.

       RealtimeEndpointInfo -> (structure)
          The endpoint information of the MLModel

          PeakRequestsPerSecond -> (integer)
              The maximum processing  rate  for  the  real-time  endpoint  for
              MLModel , measured in incoming requests per second.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that the request to create the real-time endpoint for
              the MLModel was received. The time is expressed in epoch time.

          EndpointUrl -> (string)
              The URI that specifies where to send  real-time  prediction  re-
              quests for the MLModel .
                 Note:  The application must wait until the real-time endpoint
                 is ready before using this URI.

          EndpointStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the real-time endpoint for the  MLModel  .
              This element can have one of the following values:

              o NONE - Endpoint does not exist or was previously deleted.

              o READY  -  Endpoint  is  ready to be used for real-time predic-
                tions.

              o UPDATING - Updating/creating the endpoint.
