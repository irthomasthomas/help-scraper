DESCRIBE-DATA-SOURCES()                                DESCRIBE-DATA-SOURCES()



NAME
       describe-data-sources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of DataSource that match the search criteria in the re-
       quest.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-data-sources is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Results

OPTIONS
       --filter-variable (string)

          o CreatedAt - Sets the search criteria to DataSource creation dates.

          o Status - Sets the search criteria to DataSource statuses.

          o Name  -  Sets  the  search  criteria to the contents of DataSource
            Name .

          o DataUri - Sets the search criteria to the URI of data  files  used
            to  create  the DataSource . The URI can identify either a file or
            an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or directory.

          o IAMUser - Sets the search criteria to the user  account  that  in-
            voked the DataSource creation.

          Possible values:

          o CreatedAt

          o LastUpdatedAt

          o Status

          o Name

          o DataLocationS3

          o IAMUser

       --eq (string)
          The  equal to operator. The DataSource results will have FilterVari-
          able values that exactly match the value specified with EQ .

       --gt (string)
          The greater than operator. The DataSource results will have  Filter-
          Variable values that are greater than the value specified with GT .

       --lt (string)
          The less than operator. The DataSource results will have FilterVari-
          able values that are less than the value specified with LT .

       --ge (string)
          The greater than or equal to operator. The DataSource  results  will
          have  FilterVariable  values  that  are greater than or equal to the
          value specified with GE .

       --le (string)
          The less than or equal to operator. The DataSource results will have
          FilterVariable values that are less than or equal to the value spec-
          ified with LE .

       --ne (string)
          The not equal to operator. The DataSource results will have  Filter-
          Variable values not equal to the value specified with NE .

       --prefix (string)
          A  string that is found at the beginning of a variable, such as Name
          or Id .

          For example, a DataSource could have the  Name   2014-09-09-Holiday-
          GiftMailer  .  To  search  for this DataSource , select Name for the
          FilterVariable and any of the following strings for the Prefix :

          o 2014-09

          o 2014-09-09

          o 2014-09-09-Holiday

       --sort-order (string)
          A two-value parameter that determines the sequence of the  resulting
          list of DataSource .

          o asc - Arranges the list in ascending order (A-Z, 0-9).

          o dsc - Arranges the list in descending order (Z-A, 9-0).

          Results are sorted by FilterVariable .

          Possible values:

          o asc

          o dsc

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
