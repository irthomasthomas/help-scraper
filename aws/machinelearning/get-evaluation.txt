OPTIONS
       --evaluation-id (string)
          The ID of the Evaluation to retrieve. The evaluation of each MLModel
          is  recorded  and cataloged. The ID provides the means to access the
          information.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EvaluationId -> (string)
          The evaluation ID which is same as the EvaluationId in the request.

       MLModelId -> (string)
          The ID of the MLModel that was the focus of the evaluation.

       EvaluationDataSourceId -> (string)
          The DataSource used for this evaluation.

       InputDataLocationS3 -> (string)
          The  location of the data file or directory in Amazon Simple Storage
          Service (Amazon S3).

       CreatedByIamUser -> (string)
          The AWS user account that invoked the evaluation. The  account  type
          can be either an AWS root account or an AWS Identity and Access Man-
          agement (IAM) user account.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The time that the Evaluation was created. The time is  expressed  in
          epoch time.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The time of the most recent edit to the Evaluation . The time is ex-
          pressed in epoch time.

       Name -> (string)
          A user-supplied name or description of the Evaluation .

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the evaluation. This element can have one of the  fol-
          lowing values:

          o PENDING  - Amazon Machine Language (Amazon ML) submitted a request
            to evaluate an MLModel .

          o INPROGRESS - The evaluation is underway.

          o FAILED - The request to evaluate an MLModel did not run to comple-
            tion. It is not usable.

          o COMPLETED - The evaluation process completed successfully.

          o DELETED - The Evaluation is marked as deleted. It is not usable.

       PerformanceMetrics -> (structure)
          Measurements  of  how  well the MLModel performed using observations
          referenced by the DataSource . One of the following  metric  is  re-
          turned based on the type of the MLModel :

          o BinaryAUC:  A  binary  MLModel uses the Area Under the Curve (AUC)
            technique to measure performance.

          o RegressionRMSE: A regression MLModel uses the Root Mean Square Er-
            ror  (RMSE)  technique  to  measure performance. RMSE measures the
            difference between predicted and actual values for a single  vari-
            able.

          o MulticlassAvgFScore:  A multiclass MLModel uses the F1 score tech-
            nique to measure performance.

          For more information  about  performance  metrics,  please  see  the
          Amazon Machine Learning Developer Guide .

          Properties -> (map)
              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          tion.

       Message -> (string)
          A description of  the  most  recent  details  about  evaluating  the
          MLModel .

       ComputeTime -> (long)
          The  approximate CPU time in milliseconds that Amazon Machine Learn-
          ing spent processing the Evaluation , normalized and scaled on  com-
          putation  resources. ComputeTime is only available if the Evaluation
          is in the COMPLETED state.

       FinishedAt -> (timestamp)
          The epoch time when Amazon Machine Learning marked the Evaluation as
          COMPLETED  or FAILED . FinishedAt is only available when the Evalua-
          tion is in the COMPLETED or FAILED state.

       StartedAt -> (timestamp)
          The epoch time when Amazon Machine Learning marked the Evaluation as
          INPROGRESS  .  StartedAt isn't available if the Evaluation is in the
