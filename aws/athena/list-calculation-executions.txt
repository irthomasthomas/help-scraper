OPTIONS
       --session-id (string)
          The session ID.

       --state-filter (string)
          A  filter  for a specific calculation execution state. A description
          of each state follows.
              CREATING - The calculation is in the process of being created.

              CREATED - The calculation has been created and is ready to run.

              QUEUED - The calculation has been queued for processing.

              RUNNING - The calculation is running.

              CANCELING - A request to cancel the  calculation  has  been  re-
              ceived and the system is working to stop it.

              CANCELED - The calculation is no longer running as the result of
              a cancel request.

              COMPLETED - The calculation has completed without error.

              FAILED - The calculation failed and is no longer running.

          Possible values:

          o CREATING

          o CREATED

          o QUEUED

          o RUNNING

          o CANCELING

          o CANCELED

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of calculation executions to return.

       --next-token (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue  pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain the
          next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of
          the previous page call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT

                 State -> (string)
                     The state of the calculation execution. A description  of
                     each state follows.
                        CREATING  - The calculation is in the process of being
                        created.

                        CREATED - The calculation  has  been  created  and  is
