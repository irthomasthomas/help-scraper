OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the data catalog to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a data catalog

       The following delete-data-catalog example deletes the UnusedDataCatalog
       data catalog.

          aws athena delete-data-catalog \
              --name UnusedDataCatalog

       This command produces no output.

       For  more  information,  see Deleting a Catalog: delete-data-catalog in
       the Amazon Athena User Guide.

OUTPUT
       DataCatalog -> (structure)
          Contains information about a data catalog in an Amazon Web  Services
          account.

          NOTE:
              In  the  Athena  console,  data  catalogs  are  listed  as "data
              sources" on the Data sources page under  the  Data  source  name
              column.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  of  the data catalog. The catalog name must be unique
              for the Amazon Web Services account and can use a maximum of 127
              alphanumeric, underscore, at sign, or hyphen characters. The re-
              mainder of the length constraint of 256 is reserved for  use  by
              Athena.

          Description -> (string)
              An optional description of the data catalog.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of data catalog to create: LAMBDA for a federated cata-
              log, GLUE for an Glue Data Catalog, and  HIVE  for  an  external
              Apache  Hive  metastore.  FEDERATED  is  a federated catalog for
              which Athena creates the connection and the Lambda function  for
              you based on the parameters that you pass.

          Parameters -> (map)
              Specifies  the  Lambda function or functions to use for the data
              catalog. This is a mapping whose values depend  on  the  catalog
              type.

              o For  the HIVE data catalog type, use the following syntax. The
                metadata-function parameter is required. The  sdk-version  pa-
                rameter  is  optional  and defaults to the currently supported
                version.
                ``
                metadata-function=*lambda_arn* ,  sdk-version=*version_number*
                ``

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 240)
                Inline literal start-string without end-string.

              o For  the  LAMBDA  data  catalog type, use one of the following
                sets of required parameters, but not both.

                o If you have one Lambda function that processes metadata  and
                  another  for reading the actual data, use the following syn-
                  tax. Both parameters are required.
                  ``
                  metadata-function=*lambda_arn*        ,         record-func-
                  tion=*lambda_arn* ``

                System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 245)
                  Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                o If  you have a composite Lambda function that processes both
                  metadata and data, use the following syntax to specify  your
                  Lambda function.
                  ``
                  function=*lambda_arn* ``

                System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 247)
                  Inline literal start-string without end-string.

              o The  GLUE  type  takes a catalog ID parameter and is required.
                The `` catalog_id `` is the account ID of the Amazon Web  Ser-
                vices account to which the Glue catalog belongs.
                ``
                catalog-id=*catalog_id* ``

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 252)
                Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                o The  GLUE data catalog type also applies to the default Aws-
                  DataCatalog that already exists in your  account,  of  which
                  you can have only one and cannot modify.

              o The  FEDERATED data catalog type uses one of the following pa-
                rameters, but not both. Use  connection-arn  for  an  existing
                Glue connection. Use connection-type and connection-properties
                to specify the configuration setting for a new connection.

                o

                  ``

                System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 263)
                  Inline literal start-string without end-string.
