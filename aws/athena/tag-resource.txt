TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  one or more tags to an Athena resource. A tag is a label that you
       assign to a resource. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value,
       both  of  which you define. For example, you can use tags to categorize
       Athena workgroups, data catalogs, or capacity reservations by  purpose,
       owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys to make it eas-
       ier to search and filter the resources in your account. For best  prac-
       tices, see Tagging Best Practices . Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8
       Unicode characters, and tag values can be from 0 to 256  UTF-8  Unicode
       characters.  Tags  can  use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8,
       and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values  are
       case-sensitive.  Tag  keys  must be unique per resource. If you specify
       more than one tag, separate them by commas.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          Specifies the ARN of the Athena resource to which  tags  are  to  be
          added.

       --tags (list)
          A  collection  of one or more tags, separated by commas, to be added
          to an Athena resource.

          (structure)
              A label that you assign to a resource. Athena resources  include
              workgroups,  data  catalogs, and capacity reservations. Each tag
              consists of a key and an optional value, both of which  you  de-
              fine.  For  example,  you  can use tags to categorize Athena re-
              sources by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent  set
              of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter the resources
              in your account. For best practices, see Tagging Best  Practices
              .  Tag  keys  can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode characters, and
              tag values can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode  characters.  Tags
              can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
              lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.  Tag  keys  and  values  are
              case-sensitive.  Tag  keys  must  be unique per resource. If you
              specify more than one tag, separate them by commas.

              Key -> (string)
                 A tag key. The tag key length is from 1 to 128 Unicode  char-
                 acters  in  UTF-8.  You  can  use  letters and numbers repre-
                 sentable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _  :
                 /  @.  Tag keys are case-sensitive and must be unique per re-
                 source.

              Value -> (string)
                 A tag value. The tag value length is from 0  to  256  Unicode
                 characters  in  UTF-8. You can use letters and numbers repre-
                 sentable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _  :
                 / @. Tag values are case-sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To add a tag to a resource

       The  following  tag-resource  example  adds  three  tags  to  the   dy-
       namo_db_catalog data catalog.

          aws athena tag-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:athena:us-west-2:111122223333:datacatalog/dynamo_db_catalog \
              --tags Key=Organization,Value=Retail Key=Division,Value=Mountain Key=Product_Line,Value=Shoes Key=Location,Value=Denver

       This  command  produces  no  output. To see the  result, use aws athena
       list-tags-for-resource                                   --resource-arn
       arn:aws:athena:us-west-2:111122223333:datacatalog/dynamo_db_catalog.

       For  more  information,  see Adding tags to a resource: tag-resource in
       the Amazon Athena User Guide.
