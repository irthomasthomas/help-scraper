OPTIONS
       --session-id (string)
          The session ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SessionId -> (string)
          The session ID.

       Description -> (string)
          The session description.

       WorkGroup -> (string)
          The workgroup to which the session belongs.

       EngineVersion -> (string)
          The  engine version used by the session (for example, PySpark engine
          version 3 ). You can get a list of engine versions by calling   Lis-
          tEngineVersions .

       EngineConfiguration -> (structure)
          Contains engine configuration information like DPU usage.

          CoordinatorDpuSize -> (integer)
              The  number of DPUs to use for the coordinator. A coordinator is
              a special executor that orchestrates processing work and manages
              other executors in a notebook session.

          MaxConcurrentDpus -> (integer)
              The maximum number of DPUs that can run concurrently.

          DefaultExecutorDpuSize -> (integer)
              The  default number of DPUs to use for executors. An executor is
              the smallest unit of compute that a notebook session can request
              from Athena.

          AdditionalConfigs -> (map)
              Contains  additional notebook engine MAP<string, string> parame-
              ter mappings in the form  of  key-value  pairs.  To  specify  an
              Athena notebook that the Jupyter server will download and serve,
              specify a  value  for  the   StartSessionRequest$NotebookVersion
              field,  and then add a key named NotebookId to AdditionalConfigs
              that has the value of the Athena notebook ID.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       NotebookVersion -> (string)
          The notebook version.

       SessionConfiguration -> (structure)
          Contains the workgroup configuration information used  by  the  ses-
          sion.

          ExecutionRole -> (string)
              The ARN of the execution role used for the session.

          WorkingDirectory -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 location that stores information for the notebook.

          IdleTimeoutSeconds -> (long)
              The idle timeout in seconds for the session.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              If query and calculation results are encrypted in Amazon S3, in-
              dicates the encryption option  used  (for  example,  SSE_KMS  or
              CSE_KMS ) and key information.

              EncryptionOption -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether Amazon S3 server-side encryption with Ama-
                 zon S3-managed keys (SSE_S3 ),  server-side  encryption  with
                 KMS-managed  keys  (SSE_KMS ), or client-side encryption with
                 KMS-managed keys (CSE_KMS ) is used.

                 If a query runs in a workgroup and  the  workgroup  overrides
                 client-side  settings,  then  the workgroup's setting for en-
                 cryption is used. It specifies whether query results must  be
                 encrypted, for all queries that run in this workgroup.

              KmsKey -> (string)
                 For SSE_KMS and CSE_KMS , this is the KMS key ARN or ID.

          StartDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the session started.

              The date and time starting at which the session became idle. Can
              be empty if the session is not currently idle.

                 resources.

                 CREATED - The session has been started.

                 IDLE - The session is able to accept a calculation.
