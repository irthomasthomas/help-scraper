OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The query name.

       --description (string)
          The query description.

       --database (string)
          The database to which the query belongs.

       --query-string (string)
          The contents of the query with all query statements.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique case-sensitive string used to ensure the request to  create
          the  query  is  idempotent  (executes only once). If another Create-
          NamedQuery request is received, the same response  is  returned  and
          another  query is not created. If a parameter has changed, for exam-
          ple, the QueryString , an error is returned.

          WARNING:
              This token is listed as not required because Amazon Web Services
              SDKs  (for  example  the  Amazon  Web  Services  SDK  for  Java)
              auto-generate the token for users. If you are not using the Ama-
              zon  Web  Services  SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI, you must
              provide this token or the action will fail.

       --work-group (string)
          The name of the workgroup in which the named query is being created.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a named query

       The following create-named-query example creates a saved query  in  the
       AthenaAdmin  workgroup  that  queries  the  flights_parquet  table  for
       flights from Seattle to New York in January, 2016 whose  departure  and
       arrival were both delayed by more than ten minutes. Because the airport
       code values in the table are strings that include  double  quotes  (for
       example, "SEA"), they are escaped by backslashes and surrounded by sin-
       gle quotes.

          aws athena create-named-query \
              --name "SEA to JFK delayed flights Jan 2016" \
              --description "Both arrival and departure delayed more than 10 minutes." \
              --database sampledb \
              --query-string "SELECT flightdate, carrier, flightnum, origin, dest, depdelayminutes, arrdelayminutes FROM sampledb.flights_parquet WHERE yr = 2016 AND month = 1 AND origin = '\"SEA\"' AND dest = '\"JFK\"' AND depdelayminutes > 10 AND arrdelayminutes > 10" \
              --work-group AthenaAdmin

       Output:

          {
              "NamedQueryId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For more information, see Running SQL Queries Using  Amazon  Athena  in
       the Amazon Athena User Guide.

OUTPUT
       NamedQueryId -> (string)
          The unique ID of the query.
