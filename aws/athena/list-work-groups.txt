OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain  the
          next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of
          the previous page call.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of workgroups to return in this request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list workgroups

       The following list-work-groups example lists the workgroups in the cur-
       rent account.

                  },
                  {
                      "Name": "primary",
                      "State": "ENABLED",
                      "Description": "",
                      "CreationTime": 1567465222.723
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       WorkGroups -> (list)
          A list of  WorkGroupSummary objects that include the names, descrip-
          tions, creation times, and states for each workgroup.

          (structure)
              The  summary  information  for the workgroup, which includes its
              name, state, description, and the date and time it was created.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the workgroup.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the workgroup.

              Description -> (string)
                 The workgroup description.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The workgroup creation date and time.

              EngineVersion -> (structure)
                 The engine version setting for all queries on the  workgroup.
                 Queries on the AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality workgroup run
                 on the preview engine regardless of this setting.

                 SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                     The engine version requested by the user. Possible values
                     are  determined by the output of ListEngineVersions , in-
                     cluding Auto. The default is Auto.

                 EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                     Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If
                     the user requests a valid engine version other than Auto,
                     the effective engine version is the same  as  the  engine
                     version  that  the  user  requested. If the user requests
                     Auto, the effective engine version is chosen  by  Athena.
                     When  a request to update the engine version is made by a
                     CreateWorkGroup or UpdateWorkGroup operation, the  Effec-
                     tiveEngineVersion field is ignored.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain  the
          next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of
          the previous page call.
