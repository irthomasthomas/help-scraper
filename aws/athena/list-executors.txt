NAME
       list-executors -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists,  in descending order, the executors that joined a session. Newer
       executors are listed first; older executors are listed later.  The  re-
       sult can be optionally filtered by state.

OPTIONS
       --session-id (string)
          The session ID.

       --executor-state-filter (string)
          A  filter for a specific executor state. A description of each state
          follows.
              CREATING - The executor is being  started,  including  acquiring
              resources.

              CREATED - The executor has been started.

              REGISTERED - The executor has been registered.

              TERMINATING - The executor is in the process of shutting down.

              TERMINATED - The executor is no longer running.

              FAILED - Due to a failure, the executor is no longer running.

          Possible values:

          o CREATING

          o CREATED

          o REGISTERED

          o TERMINATING

          o TERMINATED

          o FAILED

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of executors to return.

       --next-token (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain  the
          next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of
          the previous page call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SessionId -> (string)
          The session ID.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue  pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain the
          next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of
          the previous page call.

       ExecutorsSummary -> (list)
          Contains summary information about the executor.

          (structure)
              Contains summary information about an executor.

              ExecutorId -> (string)
                 The UUID of the executor.

              ExecutorType -> (string)
                 The  type of executor used for the application (COORDINATOR ,
                 GATEWAY , or WORKER ).

              StartDateTime -> (long)
                 The date and time that the executor started.

              TerminationDateTime -> (long)
                 The date and time that the executor was terminated.

              ExecutorState -> (string)
                 The processing state of the executor. A description  of  each
                 state follows.
                     CREATING  -  The executor is being started, including ac-
                     quiring resources.

                     CREATED - The executor has been started.

                     REGISTERED - The executor has been registered.

                     TERMINATING - The executor is in the process of  shutting
                     down.

                     ning.

              ExecutorSize -> (long)
                 The smallest unit of compute that a session can request  from
                 Athena.  Size  is measured in data processing unit (DPU) val-
                 ues, a relative measure of processing power.
