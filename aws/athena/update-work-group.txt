OPTIONS
       --work-group (string)
          The specified workgroup that will be updated.

       --description (string)
          The workgroup description.

       --configuration-updates (structure)
          Contains configuration updates for an Athena SQL workgroup.

          EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration -> (boolean)
              If set to  "true",  the  settings  for  the  workgroup  override
              client-side settings. If set to "false" client-side settings are
              used. For more  information,  see  Workgroup  Settings  Override
              Client-Side Settings .

          ResultConfigurationUpdates -> (structure)
              The  result  configuration information about the queries in this
              workgroup that will be updated. Includes the updated results lo-
              cation and an updated option for encrypting query results.

              OutputLocation -> (string)
                 The  location  in  Amazon S3 where your query and calculation
                 results are stored, such as s3://path/to/query/bucket/ .  For
                 more  information,  see  Working  with  query results, recent
                 queries, and output files . If  workgroup  settings  override
                 client-side  settings,  then  the query uses the location for
                 the query results and the encryption configuration  that  are
                 specified  for  the  workgroup. The "workgroup settings over-
                 ride"   is   specified    in    EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration
                 (true/false)  in the WorkGroupConfiguration . See  WorkGroup-
                 Configuration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration .

              RemoveOutputLocation -> (boolean)
                 If set to "true",  indicates  that  the  previously-specified
                 query  results location (also known as a client-side setting)
                 for queries in this workgroup should be ignored  and  set  to
                 null. If set to "false" or not set, and a value is present in
                 the   OutputLocation   in   ResultConfigurationUpdates   (the
                 client-side  setting),  the OutputLocation in the workgroup's
                 ResultConfiguration will be updated with the new  value.  For
                 more information, see Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side
                 Settings .

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The encryption configuration for query  and  calculation  re-
                 sults.

                 EncryptionOption -> (string)
                     Indicates  whether  Amazon S3 server-side encryption with
                     Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE_S3 ), server-side  encryption
                     with  KMS-managed keys (SSE_KMS ), or client-side encryp-
                     tion with KMS-managed keys (CSE_KMS ) is used.

                     If a query runs in a workgroup and  the  workgroup  over-
                     rides  client-side settings, then the workgroup's setting
                     for encryption is used. It specifies  whether  query  re-
                     sults must be encrypted, for all queries that run in this
                     workgroup.

                 KmsKey -> (string)
                     For SSE_KMS and CSE_KMS , this is the KMS key ARN or ID.

              RemoveEncryptionConfiguration -> (boolean)
                 If set to "true", indicates that the previously-specified en-
                 cryption  configuration  (also  known as the client-side set-
                 ting) for queries in this workgroup should be ignored and set
                 to null. If set to "false" or not set, and a value is present
                 in the EncryptionConfiguration in  ResultConfigurationUpdates
                 (the client-side setting), the EncryptionConfiguration in the
                 workgroup's ResultConfiguration will be updated with the  new
                 value.  For more information, see Workgroup Settings Override
                 Client-Side Settings .

              ExpectedBucketOwner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID that you expect to be  the
                 owner  of the Amazon S3 bucket specified by  ResultConfigura-
                 tion$OutputLocation . If set, Athena uses the value  for  Ex-
                 pectedBucketOwner when it makes Amazon S3 calls to your spec-
                 ified output location. If the ExpectedBucketOwner Amazon  Web
                 Services  account  ID  does not match the actual owner of the
                 Amazon S3 bucket, the call fails with a permissions error.

                 If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the
                 query  uses the ExpectedBucketOwner setting that is specified
                 for the workgroup, and also uses  the  location  for  storing
                 query  results specified in the workgroup. See  WorkGroupCon-
                 figuration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration and  Workgroup  Set-
                 tings Override Client-Side Settings .

              RemoveExpectedBucketOwner -> (boolean)
                 If  set to "true", removes the Amazon Web Services account ID
                 previously specified for   ResultConfiguration$ExpectedBucke-
                 tOwner . If set to "false" or not set, and a value is present
                 in the ExpectedBucketOwner in ResultConfigurationUpdates (the
                 client-side  setting),  the  ExpectedBucketOwner in the work-
                 group's ResultConfiguration is updated with  the  new  value.
                 For   more   information,  see  Workgroup  Settings  Override
                 Client-Side Settings .

              AclConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The ACL configuration for the query results.

                 S3AclOption -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 canned ACL that Athena should specify  when
                     storing  query  results.  Currently  the  only  supported
                     canned ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL . If a query runs
                     in  a  workgroup  and the workgroup overrides client-side
                     settings, then the Amazon S3 canned ACL specified in  the
                     workgroup's  settings is used for all queries that run in
                     the workgroup.  For  more  information  about  Amazon  S3
                     canned ACLs, see Canned ACL in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              RemoveAclConfiguration -> (boolean)
                 If  set to true , indicates that the previously-specified ACL
                 configuration for queries in this workgroup should be ignored
                 and  set  to null. If set to false or not set, and a value is
                 present in the AclConfiguration of ResultConfigurationUpdates
                 , the AclConfiguration in the workgroup's ResultConfiguration
                 is updated with the new  value.  For  more  information,  see
                 Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings .

          PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  this workgroup enables publishing metrics to
              Amazon CloudWatch.

          BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery -> (long)
              The upper limit (cutoff) for the amount of bytes a single  query
              in a workgroup is allowed to scan.

          RemoveBytesScannedCutoffPerQuery -> (boolean)
              Indicates  that  the  data  usage control limit per query is re-
              moved.  WorkGroupConfiguration$BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery

          RequesterPaysEnabled -> (boolean)
              If set to true , allows members assigned to a workgroup to spec-
              ify Amazon S3 Requester Pays buckets in queries. If set to false
              , workgroup members cannot query data from Requester Pays  buck-
              ets,  and queries that retrieve data from Requester Pays buckets
              cause an error. The default is  false  .  For  more  information
              about  Requester Pays buckets, see Requester Pays Buckets in the
              Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide .

          EngineVersion -> (structure)
              The engine version requested when a workgroup is updated.  After
              the  update,  all  queries on the workgroup run on the requested
              engine version. If no value was previously set, the  default  is
              Auto.  Queries on the AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality workgroup
              run on the preview engine regardless of this setting.

              SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The engine version requested by the user. Possible values are
                 determined  by  the  output of ListEngineVersions , including
                 AUTO. The default is AUTO.

              EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                 Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If the
                 user requests a valid engine version other than Auto, the ef-
                 fective engine version is the same as the engine version that
                 the  user requested. If the user requests Auto, the effective
                 engine version is chosen by Athena. When a request to  update
                 the  engine  version  is made by a CreateWorkGroup or Update-
                 WorkGroup operation, the EffectiveEngineVersion field is  ig-
                 nored.

          RemoveCustomerContentEncryptionConfiguration -> (boolean)
              Removes   content   encryption   configuration  from  an  Apache
              Spark-enabled Athena workgroup.

          AdditionalConfiguration -> (string)
              Contains a user defined string in JSON format  for  a  Spark-en-
              abled workgroup.

          ExecutionRole -> (string)
              Contains the ARN of the execution role for the workgroup

          CustomerContentEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  KMS  key that is used to encrypt the user's data
              stores in Athena. This setting does  not  apply  to  Athena  SQL
              workgroups.

              KmsKey -> (string)
                 The KMS key that is used to encrypt the user's data stores in
                 Athena.

          EnableMinimumEncryptionConfiguration -> (boolean)
              Enforces a minimal level of encryption  for  the  workgroup  for
              query  and  calculation  results  that are written to Amazon S3.
              When enabled, workgroup users can set  encryption  only  to  the
              minimum  level set by the administrator or higher when they sub-
              mit queries. This setting does not apply to Spark-enabled  work-
              groups.

              The  EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration setting takes precedence over
              the EnableMinimumEncryptionConfiguration flag. This  means  that
              if  EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration  is true, the EnableMinimumEn-
              cryptionConfiguration flag is ignored, and the workgroup config-
              uration for encryption is used.

       --state (string)
          The workgroup state that will be updated for the given workgroup.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a workgroup

       The following update-work-group example disables the Data_Analyst_Group
       workgroup. Users cannot run or create queries  in  the  disabled  work-
       group, but can still view metrics, data usage limit controls, workgroup
       settings, query history, and saved queries.

          aws athena update-work-group \
              --work-group Data_Analyst_Group \
              --state DISABLED

       This command produces no output. To verify the change in state, use aws
       athena  get-work-group  --work-group  Data_Analyst_Group  and check the
       State property in the output.

       For more information, see Managing Workgroups in the Amazon Athena User
       Guide.
