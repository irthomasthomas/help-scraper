GET-QUERY-EXECUTION()                                    GET-QUERY-EXECUTION()



NAME
       get-query-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a single execution of a query if you have ac-
       cess to the workgroup in which the query ran. Each time  a  query  exe-
       cutes, information about the query execution is saved with a unique ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

SYNOPSIS
            get-query-execution
          --query-execution-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-execution-id (string)
          The unique ID of the query execution.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To return information about a query execution

       The following get-query-execution example returns information about the
       query that has the specified query ID.

OUTPUT
       QueryExecution -> (structure)
          Information about the query execution.

          QueryExecutionId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for each query execution.

          Query -> (string)
              The SQL query statements which the query execution ran.

          StatementType -> (string)
              The  type  of  query  statement  that was run. DDL indicates DDL
              query statements. DML indicates DML (Data Manipulation Language)
              query statements, such as CREATE TABLE AS SELECT . UTILITY indi-
              cates query statements other than DDL and DML, such as SHOW CRE-
              ATE TABLE , or DESCRIBE TABLE .

          ResultConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  location  in  Amazon S3 where query and calculation results
              are stored and the encryption option, if any, used for query re-
              sults.  These  are known as "client-side settings". If workgroup
              settings override client-side settings, then the query uses  the
              location  for the query results and the encryption configuration
              that are specified for the workgroup.

              OutputLocation -> (string)
                 The location in Amazon S3 where your  query  and  calculation
                 results  are  stored, such as s3://path/to/query/bucket/ . To
                 run the query, you must specify the  query  results  location
                 using  one  of  the ways: either for individual queries using
                 either this setting (client-side), or in the workgroup, using
                 WorkGroupConfiguration  .  If none of them is set, Athena is-
                 sues an error that no output location is provided.  For  more
                 information,  see Working with query results, recent queries,
                 and output files . If workgroup settings override client-side
                 settings,  then the query uses the settings specified for the
                 workgroup.  See   WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupCon-
                 figuration .

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 If  query and calculation results are encrypted in Amazon S3,
                 indicates the encryption option used (for example, SSE_KMS or
                 CSE_KMS ) and key information. This is a client-side setting.
                 If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the
                 query uses the encryption configuration that is specified for
                 the workgroup, and also uses the location for  storing  query
                 results  specified in the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfigura-
                 tion$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration  and  Workgroup   Settings
                 Override Client-Side Settings .

                 EncryptionOption -> (string)
                     Indicates  whether  Amazon S3 server-side encryption with
                     Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE_S3 ), server-side  encryption
                     with  KMS-managed keys (SSE_KMS ), or client-side encryp-
                     tion with KMS-managed keys (CSE_KMS ) is used.

                     If a query runs in a workgroup and  the  workgroup  over-
                     rides  client-side settings, then the workgroup's setting
                     for encryption is used. It specifies  whether  query  re-
                     sults must be encrypted, for all queries that run in this
                     workgroup.

                 KmsKey -> (string)
                     For SSE_KMS and CSE_KMS , this is the KMS key ARN or ID.

              ExpectedBucketOwner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID that you expect to be  the
                 owner  of the Amazon S3 bucket specified by  ResultConfigura-
                 tion$OutputLocation . If set, Athena uses the value  for  Ex-
                 pectedBucketOwner when it makes Amazon S3 calls to your spec-
                 ified output location. If the ExpectedBucketOwner Amazon  Web
                 Services  account  ID  does not match the actual owner of the
                 Amazon S3 bucket, the call fails with a permissions error.

                 This is a client-side setting. If workgroup settings override
                 client-side  settings, then the query uses the ExpectedBucke-
                 tOwner setting that is specified for the workgroup, and  also
                 uses  the location for storing query results specified in the
                 workgroup.  See   WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupCon-
                 figuration  and  Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Set-
                 tings .

              AclConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Indicates that an Amazon S3 canned ACL should be set to  con-
                 trol  ownership  of  stored query results. Currently the only
                 supported canned ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL . This is a
                 client-side   setting.   If   workgroup   settings   override
                 client-side settings, then the query uses the ACL  configura-
                 tion  that  is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the
                 location for storing query results  specified  in  the  work-
                 group.  For more information, see  WorkGroupConfiguration$En-
                 forceWorkGroupConfiguration and Workgroup  Settings  Override
                 Client-Side Settings .

                 S3AclOption -> (string)
                     The  Amazon S3 canned ACL that Athena should specify when
                     storing  query  results.  Currently  the  only  supported
                     canned ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL . If a query runs
                     in a workgroup and the  workgroup  overrides  client-side
                     settings,  then the Amazon S3 canned ACL specified in the
                     workgroup's settings is used for all queries that run  in
                     the  workgroup.  For  more  information  about  Amazon S3
                     canned ACLs, see Canned ACL in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          ResultReuseConfiguration -> (structure)
              Specifies the query result reuse behavior that was used for  the
              query.

              ResultReuseByAgeConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Specifies  whether  previous query results are reused, and if
                 so, their maximum age.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     True if previous query results can  be  reused  when  the
                     query is run; otherwise, false. The default is false.

                 MaxAgeInMinutes -> (integer)
                     Specifies,  in  minutes,  the  maximum  age of a previous
                     query result that Athena should consider for  reuse.  The
                     default is 60.

          QueryExecutionContext -> (structure)
              The database in which the query execution occurred.

              Database -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  database used in the query execution. The
                 database must exist in the catalog.

              Catalog -> (string)
                 The name of the data catalog used in the query execution.

          Status -> (structure)
              The completion date, current state, submission time,  and  state
              change reason (if applicable) for the query execution.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of query execution. QUEUED indicates that the query
                 has been submitted to the service, and  Athena  will  execute
                 the  query  as soon as resources are available. RUNNING indi-
                 cates that the query is in execution phase.  SUCCEEDED  indi-
                 cates  that  the query completed without errors. FAILED indi-
                 cates that the query experienced an error and  did  not  com-
                 plete  processing.  CANCELLED indicates that a user input in-
                 terrupted query execution.

                 NOTE:
                     Athena automatically retries your  queries  in  cases  of
                     certain  transient  errors.  As a result, you may see the
                     query state transition from RUNNING or FAILED to QUEUED .

              StateChangeReason -> (string)
                 Further detail about the status of the query.

              SubmissionDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the query was submitted.

              CompletionDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the query completed.

              AthenaError -> (structure)
                 Provides information about an Athena query error.

                 ErrorCategory -> (integer)
                     An integer value that specifies the category of  a  query
                     failure  error. The following list shows the category for
                     each integer value.
                        1 - System

                        2 - User

                        3 - Other

                 ErrorType -> (integer)
                     An integer value that provides specific information about
                     an  Athena  query error. For the meaning of specific val-
                     ues, see the Error Type Reference in  the  Amazon  Athena
                     User Guide .

                 Retryable -> (boolean)
                     True if the query might succeed if resubmitted.

                 ErrorMessage -> (string)
                     Contains a short description of the error that occurred.

          Statistics -> (structure)
              Query  execution statistics, such as the amount of data scanned,
              the amount of time that the query took to process, and the  type
              of statement that was run.

              EngineExecutionTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that the query took to execute.

              DataScannedInBytes -> (long)
                 The number of bytes in the data that was queried.

              DataManifestLocation -> (string)
                 The location and file name of a data manifest file. The mani-
                 fest file is saved to the Athena query  results  location  in
                 Amazon  S3.  The  manifest  file  tracks files that the query
                 wrote to Amazon S3. If the query  fails,  the  manifest  file
                 also tracks files that the query intended to write. The mani-
                 fest is useful for identifying orphaned files resulting  from
                 a  failed query. For more information, see Working with Query
                 Results, Output Files, and Query History in the Amazon Athena
                 User Guide .

              TotalExecutionTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that Athena took to run the query.

              QueryQueueTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The  number  of milliseconds that the query was in your query
                 queue waiting for resources. Note that  if  transient  errors
                 occur,  Athena  might automatically add the query back to the
                 queue.

              ServicePreProcessingTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that Athena took to preprocess the
                 query before submitting the query to the query engine.

              QueryPlanningTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that Athena took to plan the query
                 processing flow. This includes the time spent retrieving  ta-
                 ble  partitions  from  the data source. Note that because the
                 query engine performs the query planning, query planning time
                 is a subset of engine processing time.

              ServiceProcessingTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The  number  of milliseconds that Athena took to finalize and
                 publish the query results after  the  query  engine  finished
                 running the query.

              ResultReuseInformation -> (structure)
                 Contains  information  about  whether  previous query results
                 were reused for the query.

                 ReusedPreviousResult -> (boolean)
                     True if a previous query result was reused; false if  the
                     result was generated from a new run of the query.

          WorkGroup -> (string)
              The name of the workgroup in which the query ran.

          EngineVersion -> (structure)
              The engine version that executed the query.

              SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The engine version requested by the user. Possible values are
                 determined by the output of  ListEngineVersions  ,  including
                 AUTO. The default is AUTO.

              EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                 Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If the
                 user requests a valid engine version other than Auto, the ef-
                 fective engine version is the same as the engine version that
                 the user requested. If the user requests Auto, the  effective
                 engine  version is chosen by Athena. When a request to update
                 the engine version is made by a  CreateWorkGroup  or  Update-
                 WorkGroup  operation, the EffectiveEngineVersion field is ig-
                 nored.

          ExecutionParameters -> (list)
              A list of values for the parameters in a query. The  values  are
              applied sequentially to the parameters in the query in the order
              in which the parameters occur. The list of parameters is not re-
              turned in the response.

              (string)

          SubstatementType -> (string)
              The kind of query statement that was run.

          QueryResultsS3AccessGrantsConfiguration -> (structure)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 access grants are enabled for query
              results.

              EnableS3AccessGrants -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether Amazon S3 access  grants  are  enabled  for
                 query results.

              CreateUserLevelPrefix -> (boolean)
                 When enabled, appends the user ID as an Amazon S3 path prefix
                 to the query result output location.

              AuthenticationType -> (string)
                 The authentication type used for  Amazon  S3  access  grants.
