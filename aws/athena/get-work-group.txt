          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --work-group (string)
          The name of the workgroup.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To return  information about a workgroup

       The  following  get-work-group  example  returns  information about the
       AthenaAdmin workgroup.

          aws athena get-work-group \
              --work-group AthenaAdmin

       Output:

OUTPUT
       WorkGroup -> (structure)
          Information about the workgroup.

          Name -> (string)
              The workgroup name.

          State -> (string)
              The state of the workgroup: ENABLED or DISABLED.

          Configuration -> (structure)
              The  configuration of the workgroup, which includes the location
              in Amazon S3 where query results are stored, the encryption con-
              figuration,  if  any, used for query results; whether the Amazon
              CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for the workgroup; whether  work-
              group settings override client-side settings; and the data usage
              limits for the amount of data scanned per  query  or  per  work-
              group.  The workgroup settings override is specified in Enforce-
              WorkGroupConfiguration (true/false) in  the  WorkGroupConfigura-
              tion . See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration
              .

              ResultConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for the workgroup, which includes the loca-
                 tion  in Amazon S3 where query results are stored and the en-
                 cryption option, if any, used for query results. To  run  the
                 query,  you must specify the query results location using one
                 of the ways: either in the workgroup using this  setting,  or
                 for individual queries (client-side), using  ResultConfigura-
                 tion$OutputLocation . If none of them is set,  Athena  issues
                 an error that no output location is provided. For more infor-
                 mation, see Query Results .

                 OutputLocation -> (string)
                     The location in Amazon S3 where your  query  results  are
                     stored,  such  as s3://path/to/query/bucket/ . To run the
                     query, you must specify the query results location  using
                     one  of the ways: either for individual queries using ei-
                     ther this setting (client-side), or in the workgroup, us-
                     ing   WorkGroupConfiguration  .  If  none of them is set,
                     Athena issues an error that no output  location  is  pro-
                     vided. For more information, see Query Results . If work-
                     group settings override client-side  settings,  then  the
                     query  uses the settings specified for the workgroup. See
                     WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration .

                 EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                     If query results are encrypted in  Amazon  S3,  indicates
                     the  encryption  option  used  (for  example,  SSE_KMS or
                     CSE_KMS ) and key information. This is a client-side set-
                     ting.  If  workgroup  settings  override client-side set-
                     tings, then the query uses the  encryption  configuration
                     that  is  specified  for the workgroup, and also uses the
                     location for storing query results specified in the work-
                     group.  See   WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupCon-
                     figuration and Workgroup  Settings  Override  Client-Side
                     Settings .

                     EncryptionOption -> (string)
                        Indicates  whether  Amazon  S3  server-side encryption
                        with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE_S3 ), server-side en-
                        cryption   with   KMS-managed   keys  (SSE_KMS  ),  or
                        client-side encryption with KMS-managed keys  (CSE_KMS
                        ) is used.

                        If a query runs in a workgroup and the workgroup over-
                        rides client-side settings, then the workgroup's  set-
                        ting  for  encryption  is  used.  It specifies whether
                        query results must be encrypted, for all queries  that
                        run in this workgroup.

                     KmsKey -> (string)
                        For  SSE_KMS  and CSE_KMS , this is the KMS key ARN or
                        ID.

                 ExpectedBucketOwner -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services account ID that you expect to  be
                     the  owner  of the Amazon S3 bucket specified by  Result-
                     Configuration$OutputLocation . If set,  Athena  uses  the
                     value  for  ExpectedBucketOwner  when  it makes Amazon S3
                     calls to your specified output location. If the Expected-
                     BucketOwner Amazon Web Services account ID does not match
                     the actual owner of the Amazon S3 bucket, the call  fails
                     with a permissions error.

                     This  is  a  client-side  setting.  If workgroup settings
                     override client-side settings, then the  query  uses  the
                     ExpectedBucketOwner  setting  that  is  specified for the
                     workgroup, and also uses the location for  storing  query
                     results specified in the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfig-
                     uration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration and Workgroup  Set-
                     tings Override Client-Side Settings .

                 AclConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Indicates  that  an Amazon S3 canned ACL should be set to
                     control ownership of stored query results. Currently  the
                     only  supported canned ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL .
                     This is a  client-side  setting.  If  workgroup  settings
                     override  client-side  settings,  then the query uses the
                     ACL configuration that is specified  for  the  workgroup,
                     and  also  uses  the  location  for storing query results
                     specified in the workgroup.  For  more  information,  see
                     WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration  and
                     Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings .

                     S3AclOption -> (string)
                        The Amazon S3 canned ACL that  Athena  should  specify
                        when  storing  query  results. Currently the only sup-
                        ported canned ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL . If  a
                        query  runs in a workgroup and the workgroup overrides
                        client-side settings, then the Amazon  S3  canned  ACL
                        specified  in the workgroup's settings is used for all
                        queries that run in the workgroup. For  more  informa-
                        tion  about  Amazon  S3 canned ACLs, see Canned ACL in
                        the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration -> (boolean)
                 If set to "true", the settings  for  the  workgroup  override
                 client-side settings. If set to "false", client-side settings
                 are used. For more information, see Workgroup Settings  Over-
                 ride Client-Side Settings .

              PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  that the Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled for
                 the workgroup.

              BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery -> (long)
                 The upper data usage limit (cutoff) for the amount of bytes a
                 single query in a workgroup is allowed to scan.

              RequesterPaysEnabled -> (boolean)
                 If  set  to  true , allows members assigned to a workgroup to
                 reference Amazon S3 Requester Pays buckets in queries. If set
                 to false , workgroup members cannot query data from Requester
                 Pays buckets, and queries that retrieve data  from  Requester
                 Pays  buckets cause an error. The default is false . For more
                 information about Requester Pays buckets, see Requester  Pays
                 Buckets  in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide
                 .

              EngineVersion -> (structure)
                 The engine version that all queries running on the  workgroup
                 use.  Queries  on  the AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality work-
                 group run on the preview engine regardless of this setting.

                 SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                     The engine version requested by the user. Possible values
                     are  determined by the output of ListEngineVersions , in-
                     cluding Auto. The default is Auto.

                 EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                     Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If
                     the user requests a valid engine version other than Auto,
                     the effective engine version is the same  as  the  engine
                     version  that  the  user  requested. If the user requests
                     Auto, the effective engine version is chosen  by  Athena.
                     When  a request to update the engine version is made by a
                     CreateWorkGroup or UpdateWorkGroup operation, the  Effec-
                     tiveEngineVersion field is ignored.

          Description -> (string)
              The workgroup description.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the workgroup was created.
