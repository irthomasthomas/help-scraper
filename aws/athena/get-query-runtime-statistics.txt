GET-QUERY-RUNTIME-STATISTICS()                  GET-QUERY-RUNTIME-STATISTICS()



NAME
       get-query-runtime-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  query  execution runtime statistics related to a single execu-
       tion of a query if you have access to the workgroup in which the  query
       ran.  Statistics  from  the Timeline section of the response object are
       available as soon as  QueryExecutionStatus$State is in a  SUCCEEDED  or
       FAILED  state.  The  remaining  non-timeline statistics in the response
       (like stage-level input and output row count and data size) are updated
       asynchronously  and may not be available immediately after a query com-
       pletes. The non-timeline statistics are also not included when a  query
       has row-level filters defined in Lake Formation.

OPTIONS
       --query-execution-id (string)
          The unique ID of the query execution.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       QueryRuntimeStatistics -> (structure)
          Runtime statistics about the query execution.

          Timeline -> (structure)
              Timeline statistics such as query queue time, planning time, ex-
              ecution time, service processing time, and total execution time.

              QueryQueueTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The  number  of milliseconds that the query was in your query
                 queue waiting for resources. Note that  if  transient  errors
                 occur,  Athena  might automatically add the query back to the
                 queue.

              ServicePreProcessingTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that Athena spends on  preprocess-
                 ing before it submits the query to the engine.

              QueryPlanningTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that Athena took to plan the query
                 processing flow. This includes the time spent retrieving  ta-
                 ble  partitions  from  the data source. Note that because the
                 query engine performs the query planning, query planning time
                 is a subset of engine processing time.

              EngineExecutionTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that the query took to execute.

              ServiceProcessingTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The  number  of milliseconds that Athena took to finalize and
                 publish the query results after  the  query  engine  finished
                 running the query.

              TotalExecutionTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that Athena took to run the query.

          Rows -> (structure)
              Statistics  such as input rows and bytes read by the query, rows
              and bytes output by the query, and the number of rows written by
              the query.

              InputRows -> (long)

              OutputRows -> (long)
                 The number of rows returned by the query.

          OutputStage -> (structure)
              Stage statistics such as input and output rows and bytes, execu-
              tion time, and stage state. This information also includes  sub-
              stages and the query stage plan.

              StageId -> (long)
