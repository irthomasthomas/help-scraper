GET-QUERY-RUNTIME-STATISTICS()                  GET-QUERY-RUNTIME-STATISTICS()



NAME
       get-query-runtime-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  query  execution runtime statistics related to a single execu-
       tion of a query if you have access to the workgroup in which the  query
       ran.  The  query  execution  runtime  statistics  is returned only when
       QueryExecutionStatus$State is in a SUCCEEDED or FAILED state.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-query-runtime-statistics
          --query-execution-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-execution-id (string)
          The unique ID of the query execution.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       QueryRuntimeStatistics -> (structure)
          Runtime statistics about the query execution.

          Timeline -> (structure)
              Timeline statistics such as query queue time, planning time, ex-
              ecution time, service processing time, and total execution time.

              QueryQueueTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that the query was in  your  query
                 queue  waiting  for  resources. Note that if transient errors
                 occur, Athena might automatically add the query back  to  the
                 queue.

              QueryPlanningTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that Athena took to plan the query
                 processing flow. This includes the time spent retrieving  ta-
                 ble  partitions  from  the data source. Note that because the
                 query engine performs the query planning, query planning time
                 is a subset of engine processing time.

              EngineExecutionTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that the query took to execute.

              ServiceProcessingTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The  number  of milliseconds that Athena took to finalize and
                 publish the query results after  the  query  engine  finished
                 running the query.

              TotalExecutionTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that Athena took to run the query.

          Rows -> (structure)
              Statistics  such as input rows and bytes read by the query, rows
              and bytes output by the query, and the number of rows written by
              the query.
