OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          The session description.

       --work-group (string)
          The workgroup to which the session belongs.

       --engine-configuration (structure)
          Contains engine data processing unit  (DPU)  configuration  settings
          and parameter mappings.

          CoordinatorDpuSize -> (integer)
              The  number of DPUs to use for the coordinator. A coordinator is
              a special executor that orchestrates processing work and manages
              other executors in a notebook session. The default is 1.

          MaxConcurrentDpus -> (integer)
              The maximum number of DPUs that can run concurrently.

          DefaultExecutorDpuSize -> (integer)
              The  default number of DPUs to use for executors. An executor is
              the smallest unit of compute that a notebook session can request
              from Athena. The default is 1.

          AdditionalConfigs -> (map)
              Contains  additional notebook engine MAP<string, string> parame-
              ter mappings in the form  of  key-value  pairs.  To  specify  an
              Athena notebook that the Jupyter server will download and serve,
              specify a  value  for  the   StartSessionRequest$NotebookVersion
              field,  and then add a key named NotebookId to AdditionalConfigs
              that has the value of the Athena notebook ID.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CoordinatorDpuSize=integer,MaxConcurrentDpus=integer,DefaultExecutorDpuSize=integer,AdditionalConfigs={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CoordinatorDpuSize": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentDpus": integer,
            "DefaultExecutorDpuSize": integer,
            "AdditionalConfigs": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --notebook-version (string)
          The notebook version. This value is supplied automatically for note-
          book sessions in the Athena console and is not required for program-
          matic session access. The only  valid  notebook  version  is  Athena
          notebook  version  1  . If you specify a value for NotebookVersion ,
          you must also specify a value for NotebookId . See  EngineConfigura-
          tion$AdditionalConfigs .

       --session-idle-timeout-in-minutes (integer)
          The idle timeout in minutes for the session.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique case-sensitive string used to ensure the request to create
          the session is idempotent (executes only once). If another StartSes-
          sionRequest  is  received, the same response is returned and another
          session is not created. If a parameter has changed, an error is  re-
          turned.

          WARNING:
              This token is listed as not required because Amazon Web Services
              SDKs  (for  example  the  Amazon  Web  Services  SDK  for  Java)
              auto-generate the token for users. If you are not using the Ama-
              zon Web Services SDK or the Amazon Web Services  CLI,  you  must
              provide this token or the action will fail.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SessionId -> (string)
          The session ID.

       State -> (string)
          The state of the session. A description of each state follows.
              CREATING - The session is being started, including acquiring re-

              TERMINATING - The session is in the process of shutting down.

              TERMINATED - The session and its resources are  no  longer  run-
              ning.

              FAILED  - Due to a failure, the session and its resources are no
              longer running.
