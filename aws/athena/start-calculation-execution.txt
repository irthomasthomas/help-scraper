OPTIONS
       --session-id (string)
          The session ID.

       --description (string)
          A description of the calculation.

       --calculation-configuration (structure)
          Contains configuration information for the calculation.

          CodeBlock -> (string)
              A string that contains the code for the calculation.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CodeBlock=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CodeBlock": "string"
          }

       --code-block (string)
          A string that contains the code of the calculation.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique case-sensitive string used to ensure the request to  create
          the  calculation  is  idempotent  (executes  only  once). If another
          StartCalculationExecutionRequest is received, the same  response  is
          returned  and another calculation is not created. If a parameter has
          changed, an error is returned.

          WARNING:
              This token is listed as not required because Amazon Web Services
              SDKs  (for  example  the  Amazon  Web  Services  SDK  for  Java)
              auto-generate the token for users. If you are not using the Ama-
              zon  Web  Services  SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI, you must
              provide this token or the action will fail.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       CalculationExecutionId -> (string)
          The calculation execution UUID.

       State -> (string)
          CREATING - The calculation is in the process of being created.

          CREATED - The calculation has been created and is ready to run.

          QUEUED - The calculation has been queued for processing.

          RUNNING - The calculation is running.

          CANCELING  -  A  request to cancel the calculation has been received
          and the system is working to stop it.

          cancel request.

          COMPLETED - The calculation has completed without error.

          FAILED - The calculation failed and is no longer running.
