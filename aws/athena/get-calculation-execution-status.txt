SYNOPSIS
            get-calculation-execution-status
          --calculation-execution-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --calculation-execution-id (string)
          The calculation execution UUID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (structure)
          Contains information about the calculation execution status.

          SubmissionDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the calculation was submitted for processing.

          CompletionDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the calculation completed processing.

          State -> (string)
              The  state  of  the calculation execution. A description of each
              state follows.
                 CREATING - The calculation is in the process  of  being  cre-
                 ated.

                 CREATED  -  The  calculation has been created and is ready to
                 run.

                 QUEUED - The calculation has been queued for processing.

                 RUNNING - The calculation is running.

                 CANCELING - A request to cancel the calculation has been  re-
                 ceived and the system is working to stop it.

                 CANCELED - The calculation is no longer running as the result
                 of a cancel request.

                 COMPLETED - The calculation has completed without error.

                 FAILED - The calculation failed and is no longer running.

          StateChangeReason -> (string)
              The reason for the calculation state change  (for  example,  the
              calculation was canceled because the session was terminated).

       Statistics -> (structure)
          Contains information about the DPU execution time and progress.

          DpuExecutionInMillis -> (long)
              The  data processing unit execution time in milliseconds for the
              calculation.

          Progress -> (string)
              The progress of the calculation.
