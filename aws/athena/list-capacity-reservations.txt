OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue pagination if a previous request was truncated.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of results to return.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain  the

                 The status of the capacity reservation.

              TargetDpus -> (integer)
                 The number of data processing units requested.

              AllocatedDpus -> (integer)
                 The number of data processing units currently allocated.

              LastAllocation -> (structure)
                 Contains  the  submission time of a single allocation request
                 for a capacity reservation and the most recent status of  the
                 attempted allocation.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the capacity allocation.

                 StatusMessage -> (string)
                     The status message of the capacity allocation.

                 RequestTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time when the capacity allocation was requested.

                 RequestCompletionTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  time  when  the capacity allocation request was com-
                     pleted.

              LastSuccessfulAllocationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time of the most recent  capacity  allocation  that  suc-
                 ceeded.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  in  UTC epoch millis when the capacity reservation
                 was created.
