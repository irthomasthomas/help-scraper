OPTIONS
       --target-dpus (integer)
          The number of requested data processing units.

       --name (string)
          The name of the capacity reservation to create.

       --tags (list)
          The tags for the capacity reservation.

          (structure)
              A label that you assign to a resource. Athena resources  include
              workgroups,  data  catalogs, and capacity reservations. Each tag
              consists of a key and an optional value, both of which  you  de-
              fine.  For  example,  you  can use tags to categorize Athena re-
              sources by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent  set
              of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter the resources
              in your account. For best practices, see Tagging Best  Practices
              .  Tag  keys  can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode characters, and
              tag values can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode  characters.  Tags
              can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
              lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.  Tag  keys  and  values  are
              case-sensitive.  Tag  keys  must  be unique per resource. If you
              specify more than one tag, separate them by commas.

              Key -> (string)
                 A tag key. The tag key length is from 1 to 128 Unicode  char-
                 acters  in  UTF-8.  You  can  use  letters and numbers repre-
                 sentable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _  :
                 /  @.  Tag keys are case-sensitive and must be unique per re-
                 source.

              Value -> (string)
                 A tag value. The tag value length is from 0  to  256  Unicode
                 characters  in  UTF-8. You can use letters and numbers repre-
                 sentable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _  :
                 / @. Tag values are case-sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

OUTPUT
       None
