       --tags (list)
          Applies one or more tags to an Amazon Chime SDK  meeting.  Note  the
          following:

          o Not all resources have tags. For a list of services with resources
            that support tagging using this operation, see Services that  sup-
            port the Resource Groups Tagging API . If the resource doesn't yet
            support this operation, the resource's service might support  tag-
            ging  using its own API operations. For more information, refer to
            the documentation for that service.

          o Each resource can have up to 50 tags. For other  limits,  see  Tag
            Naming and Usage Conventions in the AWS General Reference .

          o You  can  only tag resources that are located in the specified AWS
            Region for the AWS account.

          o To add tags to a resource, you need the necessary permissions  for
            the  service  that  the resource belongs to as well as permissions
            for adding tags. For more information, see the  documentation  for
            each service.

          WARNING:
                 Do  not  store  personally  identifiable information (PII) or
                 other confidential or sensitive information in tags.  We  use
                 tags to provide you with billing and administration services.
                 Tags are not intended to be used  for  private  or  sensitive
                 data.

              Minimum permissions

          In  addition to the tag:TagResources permission required by this op-
          eration, you must also have the tagging permission  defined  by  the
          service  that  created  the resource. For example, to tag a ChimeSD-
          KMeetings instance using the TagResources operation, you  must  have
          both of the following permissions:
              tag:TagResources

              ChimeSDKMeetings:CreateTags

          NOTE:
              Some  services might have specific requirements for tagging some
              resources. For example, to tag an Amazon  S3  bucket,  you  must
              also  have  the  s3:GetBucketTagging permission. If the expected
              minimum permissions don't work, check the documentation for that
              service's tagging APIs for more information.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that you define.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
