OPTIONS
       --meeting-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime SDK meeting ID.

       --attendee-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       Attendee -> (structure)
          The Amazon Chime SDK attendee information.

          ExternalUserId -> (string)
              The Amazon Chime SDK external user  ID.  An  idempotency  token.
              Links  the attendee to an identity managed by a builder applica-
              tion.

              Pattern: [-_&@+=,(){}\[\]\/.:|'"#a-zA-Z0-9-\s]*

              Values that begin with aws: are reserved. You can't configure  a
              value that uses this prefix. Case insensitive.

          AttendeeId -> (string)
              The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.

          JoinToken -> (string)
              The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.

          Capabilities -> (structure)
              The  capabilities assigned to an attendee: audio, video, or con-
              tent.

              NOTE:
                 You use the capabilities with a set of  values  that  control
                 what  the  capabilities can do, such as SendReceive data. For
                 more information about those values, see .

              When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:

              o You can't set content capabilities to SendReceive  or  Receive
                unless  you  also set video capabilities to SendReceive or Re-
                ceive . If you don't set the video capability to receive,  the
                response  will  contain  an  HTTP 400 Bad Request status code.
                However, you can set your video capability to receive and  you
                set your content capability to not receive.

              o When  you  change  an audio capability from None or Receive to
                Send or SendReceive , and if the attendee  left  their  micro-
                phone  unmuted, audio will flow from the attendee to the other
                meeting participants.

              o When you change a video or content capability from None or Re-
                ceive  to  Send or SendReceive , and if the attendee turned on
                their video or content streams, remote attendess  can  receive
                those  streams, but only after media renegotiation between the
                client and the Amazon Chime back-end server.

              Audio -> (string)
                 The audio capability assigned to an attendee.

              Video -> (string)
                 The video capability assigned to an attendee.

              Content -> (string)
                 The content capability assigned to an attendee.
