       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              (string)

       Attendees -> (list)
          The attendee information, including attendees' IDs and join tokens.

          (structure)
              An  Amazon  Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a unique Atten-
              deeId and JoinToken . The JoinToken allows a client to authenti-
              cate  and  join as the specified attendee. The JoinToken expires
              when the meeting ends, or when  DeleteAttendee is called.  After
              that, the attendee is unable to join the meeting.

              We  recommend  securely  transferring  each  JoinToken from your
              server application to the client so that no other client has ac-
              cess to the token except for the one authorized to represent the
              attendee.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency  token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

              AttendeeId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.

              JoinToken -> (string)
                 The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.

              Capabilities -> (structure)
                 The capabilities assigned to an attendee:  audio,  video,  or
                 content.

                 NOTE:
                     You  use  the capabilities with a set of values that con-
                     trol what the capabilities can do,  such  as  SendReceive
                     data. For more information about those values, see .

                 When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:

                 o You  can't  set  content capabilities to SendReceive or Re-
                   ceive unless you also set video capabilities to SendReceive
                   or  Receive  . If you don't set the video capability to re-
                   ceive, the response will contain an HTTP  400  Bad  Request
                   status  code. However, you can set your video capability to
                   receive and you set your content capability to not receive.

                 o When you change an audio capability from None or Receive to
                   Send or SendReceive , and if the attendee left their micro-
                   phone unmuted, audio will flow from  the  attendee  to  the
                   other meeting participants.

                 o When  you change a video or content capability from None or
                   Receive to Send or SendReceive , and if the attendee turned
                   on their video or content streams, remote attendess can re-
                   ceive those streams, but only after media renegotiation be-
                   tween the client and the Amazon Chime back-end server.

                 Audio -> (string)
                     The audio capability assigned to an attendee.

                 Video -> (string)
                     The video capability assigned to an attendee.

                 Content -> (string)
                     The content capability assigned to an attendee.

       Errors -> (list)
          If the action fails for one or more of the attendees in the request,
          a list of the attendees is returned, along with error codes and  er-
          ror messages.

          (structure)
              The  list  of errors returned when errors are encountered during
              the BatchCreateAttendee and  CreateAttendee  actions.  This  in-
              cludes external user IDs, error codes, and error messages.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message.
