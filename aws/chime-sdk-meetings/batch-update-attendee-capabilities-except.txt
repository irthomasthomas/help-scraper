BATCH-UPDATE-ATTENDEE-CAPABILITIES-BATCH-UPDATE-ATTENDEE-CAPABILITIES-EXCEPT()



NAME
       batch-update-attendee-capabilities-except -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  AttendeeCapabilities  except the capabilities listed in an Ex-
       cludedAttendeeIds table.

       NOTE:
          You use the capabilities with a set of values that control what  the
          capabilities  can do, such as SendReceive data. For more information
          about those values, see .

       When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:

       o You can't set content capabilities to SendReceive or  Receive  unless
         you  also  set  video capabilities to SendReceive or Receive . If you
         don't set the video capability to receive, the response will  contain
         an  HTTP 400 Bad Request status code. However, you can set your video
         capability to receive and you set your content capability to not  re-
         ceive.

       o When  you  change an audio capability from None or Receive to Send or
         SendReceive , and if the attendee left their microphone unmuted,  au-
         dio will flow from the attendee to the other meeting participants.

       o When you change a video or content capability from None or Receive to
         Send or SendReceive , and if the attendee turned on  their  video  or
         content streams, remote attendees can receive those streams, but only
         after media renegotiation between the client  and  the  Amazon  Chime
         back-end server.

OPTIONS
       --meeting-id (string)
          The ID of the meeting associated with the update request.

       --excluded-attendee-ids (list)
          The  AttendeeIDs that you want to exclude from one or more capabili-
          ties.

          (structure)
              A structure that contains one or more attendee IDs.

              AttendeeId -> (string)
                 A list of one or more attendee IDs.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttendeeId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AttendeeId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --capabilities (structure)
          The capabilities (audio , video , or content ) that you want to  up-
          date.

          Audio -> (string)
              The audio capability assigned to an attendee.

          Video -> (string)
              The video capability assigned to an attendee.

          Content -> (string)
              The content capability assigned to an attendee.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Audio=string,Video=string,Content=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Audio": "SendReceive"|"Send"|"Receive"|"None",
            "Video": "SendReceive"|"Send"|"Receive"|"None",
            "Content": "SendReceive"|"Send"|"Receive"|"None"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)
