NAME
       update-attendee-capabilities -

DESCRIPTION
       The capabilties that you want to update.

       NOTE:
          You  use the capabilities with a set of values that control what the
          capabilities can do, such as SendReceive data. For more  information
          about those values, see .

       When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:

       o You  can't  set content capabilities to SendReceive or Receive unless
         you also set video capabilities to SendReceive or Receive  .  If  you
         don't  set the video capability to receive, the response will contain
         an HTTP 400 Bad Request status code. However, you can set your  video
         capability  to receive and you set your content capability to not re-
         ceive.

       o When you change an audio capability from None or Receive to  Send  or
         SendReceive  , and if the attendee left their microphone unmuted, au-
         dio will flow from the attendee to the other meeting participants.

       o When you change a video or content capability from None or Receive to
         Send  or  SendReceive  , and if the attendee turned on their video or
         content streams, remote attendess can receive those streams, but only
         after  media  renegotiation  between  the client and the Amazon Chime
         back-end server.

OPTIONS
       --meeting-id (string)
          The ID of the meeting associated with the update request.

       --attendee-id (string)
          The ID of the attendee associated with the update request.

       --capabilities (structure)
          The capabilties that you want to update.

          Audio -> (string)
              The audio capability assigned to an attendee.

          Video -> (string)
              The video capability assigned to an attendee.

          Content -> (string)
              The content capability assigned to an attendee.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Audio=string,Video=string,Content=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Audio": "SendReceive"|"Send"|"Receive"|"None",
            "Video": "SendReceive"|"Send"|"Receive"|"None",
            "Content": "SendReceive"|"Send"|"Receive"|"None"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Attendee -> (structure)
          The updated attendee data.

          ExternalUserId -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Chime  SDK  external user ID. An idempotency token.
              Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder  applica-
              tion.

              Pattern: [-_&@+=,(){}\[\]\/.:|'"#a-zA-Z0-9-\s]*

              Values  that begin with aws: are reserved. You can't configure a
              value that uses this prefix. Case insensitive.

          AttendeeId -> (string)
              The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.

          JoinToken -> (string)
              The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.

          Capabilities -> (structure)
              The capabilities assigned to an attendee: audio, video, or  con-
              tent.

              NOTE:
                 You  use  the  capabilities with a set of values that control
                 what the capabilities can do, such as SendReceive  data.  For
                 more information about those values, see .

              When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:

              o You  can't  set content capabilities to SendReceive or Receive
                unless you also set video capabilities to SendReceive  or  Re-
                ceive  . If you don't set the video capability to receive, the
                response will contain an HTTP 400  Bad  Request  status  code.
                However,  you can set your video capability to receive and you
                set your content capability to not receive.

              o When you change an audio capability from None  or  Receive  to
                Send  or  SendReceive  , and if the attendee left their micro-
                phone unmuted, audio will flow from the attendee to the  other
                meeting participants.

              o When you change a video or content capability from None or Re-
                ceive to Send or SendReceive , and if the attendee  turned  on
                their  video  or content streams, remote attendess can receive
                those streams, but only after media renegotiation between  the
                client and the Amazon Chime back-end server.

              Audio -> (string)
                 The audio capability assigned to an attendee.

              Video -> (string)
                 The video capability assigned to an attendee.

              Content -> (string)
                 The content capability assigned to an attendee.
