SYNOPSIS
            update-attendee-capabilities
          --meeting-id <value>
          --attendee-id <value>
          --capabilities <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --meeting-id (string)
          The ID of the meeting associated with the update request.

       --attendee-id (string)
          The ID of the attendee associated with the update request.

       --capabilities (structure)
          The capabilties that you want to update.

          Audio -> (string)
              The audio capability assigned to an attendee.

          Video -> (string)
              The video capability assigned to an attendee.

          Content -> (string)
              The content capability assigned to an attendee.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Audio=string,Video=string,Content=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Audio": "SendReceive"|"Send"|"Receive"|"None",
            "Video": "SendReceive"|"Send"|"Receive"|"None",
            "Content": "SendReceive"|"Send"|"Receive"|"None"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Attendee -> (structure)
          An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a  unique  AttendeeId
          and  JoinToken  .  The JoinToken allows a client to authenticate and
          join as the specified attendee. The JoinToken expires when the meet-
          ing  ends,  or  when   DeleteAttendee is called. After that, the at-
          tendee is unable to join the meeting.

          We recommend securely transferring each JoinToken from  your  server
          application  to the client so that no other client has access to the
          token except for the one authorized to represent the attendee.

          ExternalUserId -> (string)
              The Amazon Chime SDK external user  ID.  An  idempotency  token.
              Links  the attendee to an identity managed by a builder applica-
              tion.

          AttendeeId -> (string)
              The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.

          JoinToken -> (string)
              The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.

          Capabilities -> (structure)
              The capabilities (audio, video, or content) assigned to  an  at-
              tendee.

              Audio -> (string)
                 The audio capability assigned to an attendee.
