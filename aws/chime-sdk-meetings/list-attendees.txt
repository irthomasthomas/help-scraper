DESCRIPTION

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-attendees
          --meeting-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --meeting-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime SDK meeting ID.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in a single call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Attendees -> (list)
          The Amazon Chime SDK attendee information.

          (structure)
              An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a  unique  Atten-
              deeId and JoinToken . The JoinToken allows a client to authenti-
              cate and join as the specified attendee. The  JoinToken  expires
              when  the meeting ends, or when  DeleteAttendee is called. After
              that, the attendee is unable to join the meeting.

              We recommend securely  transferring  each  JoinToken  from  your
              server application to the client so that no other client has ac-
              cess to the token except for the one authorized to represent the
              attendee.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

              AttendeeId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.

              JoinToken -> (string)
                 The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.

              Capabilities -> (structure)
                 The  capabilities  assigned  to an attendee: audio, video, or
                 content.

                 NOTE:
                     You use the capabilities with a set of values  that  con-
                     trol  what  the  capabilities can do, such as SendReceive
                     data. For more information about those values, see .

                 When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:

                 o You can't set content capabilities to  SendReceive  or  Re-
                   ceive unless you also set video capabilities to SendReceive
                   or Receive . If you don't set the video capability  to  re-
                   ceive,  the  response  will contain an HTTP 400 Bad Request
                   status code. However, you can set your video capability  to
                   receive and you set your content capability to not receive.

                 o When you change an audio capability from None or Receive to
                   Send or SendReceive , and if the attendee left their micro-
                   phone  unmuted,  audio  will  flow from the attendee to the
                   other meeting participants.

                 o When you change a video or content capability from None  or
                   Receive to Send or SendReceive , and if the attendee turned
                   on their video or content streams, remote attendess can re-
                   ceive those streams, but only after media renegotiation be-
                   tween the client and the Amazon Chime back-end server.

                 Audio -> (string)
                     The audio capability assigned to an attendee.

                 Video -> (string)
                     The video capability assigned to an attendee.

                 Content -> (string)
                     The content capability assigned to an attendee.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.
