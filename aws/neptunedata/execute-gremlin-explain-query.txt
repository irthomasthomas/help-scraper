NAME
       execute-gremlin-explain-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Executes a Gremlin Explain query.

       Amazon  Neptune has added a Gremlin feature named explain that provides
       is a self-service tool for understanding the execution  approach  being
       taken  by  the Neptune engine for the query. You invoke it by adding an
       explain parameter to an HTTP call that submits a Gremlin query.

       The explain feature provides information about the logical structure of
       query  execution plans. You can use this information to identify poten-
       tial evaluation and execution bottlenecks and to tune  your  query,  as
       explained  in  Tuning Gremlin queries . You can also use query hints to
       improve query execution plans.

       When invoking this operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM  authen-
       tication  enabled,  the IAM user or role making the request must have a
       policy attached that allows one of the following IAM  actions  in  that
       cluster, depending on the query:

       o neptune-db:ReadDataViaQuery

       o neptune-db:WriteDataViaQuery

       o neptune-db:DeleteDataViaQuery

       Note that the neptune-db:QueryLanguage:Gremlin IAM condition key can be
       used in the policy document to restrict the use of Gremlin queries (see
       Condition  keys  available in Neptune IAM data-access policy statements
       ).

OPTIONS
       --gremlin-query (string)
          The Gremlin explain query string.

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       output -> (blob)
          A text blob containing the Gremlin explain result, as  described  in
          Tuning Gremlin queries .
