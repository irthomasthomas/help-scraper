GET-PROPERTYGRAPH-STREAM()                          GET-PROPERTYGRAPH-STREAM()



NAME
       get-propertygraph-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a stream for a property graph.

       With  the Neptune Streams feature, you can generate a complete sequence
       of change-log entries that record every change made to your graph  data
       as it happens. GetPropertygraphStream lets you collect these change-log
       entries for a property graph.

       The Neptune streams feature needs to be enabled on your Neptune DBclus-
       ter. To enable streams, set the neptune_streams DB cluster parameter to
       1 .

       See Capturing graph changes in real time using Neptune streams .

       When invoking this operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM  authen-
       tication  enabled,  the IAM user or role making the request must have a
       policy attached that allows the neptune-db:GetStreamRecords IAM  action
       in that cluster.

       When  invoking this operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM authen-
       tication enabled, the IAM user or role making the request must  have  a
       policy  attached that enables one of the following IAM actions, depend-
       ing on the query:

       Note that you can restrict property-graph queries using  the  following
       IAM context keys:

       o neptune-db:QueryLanguage:Gremlin

       o neptune-db:QueryLanguage:OpenCypher

       See  Condition  keys available in Neptune IAM data-access policy state-
       ments ).

       get-propertygraph-stream uses document type values. Document types fol-
       low the JSON data model where valid values are: strings, numbers, bool-
       eans, null, arrays, and objects. For command input, options and  nested
       parameters  that are labeled with the type document must be provided as
       JSON. Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

OPTIONS
       --limit (long)
          Specifies the maximum number of records to return. There is  also  a
          size  limit of 10 MB on the response that can't be modified and that
          takes precedence over the number of records specified in  the  limit
          parameter. The response does include a threshold-breaching record if
          the 10 MB limit was reached.

          The range for limit is 1 to 100,000, with a default of 10.

       --iterator-type (string)
          Can be one of:

          o AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER  Indicates that reading should start  from  the
            event sequence number specified jointly by the commitNum and opNum
            parameters.

          o AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER  Indicates that reading should  start  right
            after the event sequence number specified jointly by the commitNum
            and opNum parameters.

          o TRIM_HORIZON  Indicates that reading  should  start  at  the  last
            untrimmed record in the system, which is the oldest unexpired (not
            yet deleted) record in the change-log stream.

          o LATEST  Indicates that reading should start  at  the  most  recent
            record  in  the  system,  which  is  the latest unexpired (not yet
            deleted) record in the change-log stream.

          Possible values:

          o AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER

          o AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER

          o TRIM_HORIZON

          o LATEST

       --commit-num (long)
          The commit number of the starting record to read from the change-log
          stream.  This  parameter  is  required  when iteratorType is``AT_SE-
          QUENCE_NUMBER`` or AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER , and ignored  when  itera-
          torType is TRIM_HORIZON or LATEST .

       --op-num (long)
          The  operation  sequence number within the specified commit to start
          reading from in the change-log stream data. The default is 1 .

       --encoding (string)
          If set to TRUE, Neptune compresses the response using gzip encoding.

          Possible values:

          o gzip

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
