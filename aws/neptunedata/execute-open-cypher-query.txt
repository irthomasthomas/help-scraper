EXECUTE-OPEN-CYPHER-QUERY()                        EXECUTE-OPEN-CYPHER-QUERY()



NAME
       execute-open-cypher-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Executes  an  openCypher  query.  See  Accessing the Neptune Graph with
       openCypher for more information.

       Neptune supports building graph applications using openCypher, which is
       currently  one  of  the  most  popular query languages among developers
       working with graph databases. Developers, business analysts,  and  data
       scientists  like  openCypher's declarative, SQL-inspired syntax because
       it provides a familiar structure in which to querying property graphs.

       The  openCypher  language  was  originally  developed  by  Neo4j,  then
       open-sourced in 2015 and contributed to the openCypher project under an
       Apache 2 open-source license.

       Note that when invoking this operation in a Neptune  cluster  that  has
       IAM  authentication  enabled,  the  IAM user or role making the request
       must have a policy attached that allows one of the  following  IAM  ac-
       tions in that cluster, depending on the query:

       o neptune-db:ReadDataViaQuery

       o neptune-db:WriteDataViaQuery

       o neptune-db:DeleteDataViaQuery

       Note  also  that  the neptune-db:QueryLanguage:OpenCypher IAM condition
       key can be used in the policy document to restrict  the  use  of  open-
       Cypher queries (see Condition keys available in Neptune IAM data-access
       policy statements ).

       execute-open-cypher-query uses document  type  values.  Document  types
       follow  the  JSON  data model where valid values are: strings, numbers,
       booleans, null, arrays, and objects. For  command  input,  options  and
       nested  parameters that are labeled with the type document must be pro-
       vided as JSON. Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

OPTIONS
       --open-cypher-query (string)
          The openCypher query string to be executed.

       --parameters (string)
          The openCypher query parameters for query execution. See Examples of
          openCypher parameterized queries for more information.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       results -> (document)
          The openCypherquery results.
