OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       status -> (string)
          The  HTTP  return code of the request. If the request succeeded, the
          code is 200. See Common error codes for DFE statistics request for a
          list of common errors.

          When  invoking  this operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM au-
          thentication enabled, the IAM user or role making the  request  must
          have      a      policy      attached      that      allows      the
          neptune-db:GetStatisticsStatus IAM action in that cluster.

       payload -> (structure)
          Statistics for RDF data.

          autoCompute -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether or not automatic statistics generation is  en-
              abled.

          active -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether or not DFE statistics generation is enabled at
              all.

          statisticsId -> (string)
              Reports the ID of the current statistics generation run. A value
              of -1 indicates that no statistics have been generated.

          date -> (timestamp)
              The  UTC  time  at  which DFE statistics have most recently been
              generated.

          note -> (string)
              A note about problems in the case where statistics are invalid.

          signatureInfo -> (structure)
              A StatisticsSummary structure that contains:

              o signatureCount - The total number  of  signatures  across  all
                characteristic sets.

              o instanceCount  -  The  total  number of characteristic-set in-
                stances.

              o predicateCount - The total number of unique predicates.

              signatureCount -> (integer)
                 The total number  of  signatures  across  all  characteristic
                 sets.

              instanceCount -> (integer)
                 The total number of characteristic-set instances.

              predicateCount -> (integer)
                 The total number of unique predicates.
