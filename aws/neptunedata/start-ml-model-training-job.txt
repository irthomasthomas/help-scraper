START-ML-MODEL-TRAINING-JOB()                    START-ML-MODEL-TRAINING-JOB()



NAME
       start-ml-model-training-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new Neptune ML model training job. See Model training using
       the              ``modeltraining`              command               <-
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/machine-learn-
       ing-api-modeltraining.html>`__ .

       When invoking this operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM  authen-
       tication  enabled,  the IAM user or role making the request must have a
       policy attached that allows the neptune-db:StartMLModelTrainingJob  IAM
       action in that cluster.

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          A unique identifier for the new job. The default is An autogenerated
          UUID.

       --previous-model-training-job-id (string)
          The job ID of a completed model-training job that you want to update
          incrementally based on updated data.

       --data-processing-job-id (string)
          The job ID of the completed data-processing job that has created the
          data that the training will work with.

       --train-model-s3-location (string)
          The location in Amazon S3  where  the  model  artifacts  are  to  be
          stored.

       --sagemaker-iam-role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of an IAM role for SageMaker execution.This must be listed
          in your DB cluster parameter group or an error will occur.

       --neptune-iam-role-arn (string)
          The ARN of an IAM role that provides Neptune access to SageMaker and
          Amazon  S3 resources. This must be listed in your DB cluster parame-
          ter group or an error will occur.

       --base-processing-instance-type (string)
          The type of ML instance used in preparing and managing  training  of
          ML  models.  This  is a CPU instance chosen based on memory require-
          ments for processing the training data and model.

       --training-instance-type (string)
          The type of ML instance used for model training. All Neptune ML mod-
          els  support  CPU,  GPU,  and  multiGPU  training.  The  default  is
          ml.p3.2xlarge . Choosing the right instance type  for  training  de-
          pends on the task type, graph size, and your budget.

       --training-instance-volume-size-in-gb (integer)
          The  disk  volume size of the training instance. Both input data and
          the output model are stored on disk, so  the  volume  size  must  be
          large enough to hold both data sets. The default is 0. If not speci-
          fied or 0, Neptune ML selects a disk volume size based on the recom-
          mendation generated in the data processing step.

       --training-time-out-in-seconds (integer)
          Timeout  in  seconds  for the training job. The default is 86,400 (1
          day).

       --max-hpo-number-of-training-jobs (integer)
          Maximum total number of training jobs to start for the  hyperparame-
          ter tuning job. The default is 2. Neptune ML automatically tunes the
          hyperparameters of the machine learning model.  To  obtain  a  model
          that  performs well, use at least 10 jobs (in other words, set maxH-
          PONumberOfTrainingJobs to 10). In general, the more tuning runs, the
          better the results.

       --max-hpo-parallel-training-jobs (integer)
          Maximum  number  of parallel training jobs to start for the hyperpa-
          rameter tuning job. The default is 2. The number  of  parallel  jobs
          you  can  run is limited by the available resources on your training
          instance.

       --subnets (list)
          The IDs of the subnets in the Neptune VPC. The default is None.

       --security-group-ids (list)

          encrypt  data  on  the storage volume attached to the ML compute in-
          stances that run the training job. The default is None.

       --s3-output-encryption-kms-key (string)
          The Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) key that SageMaker  uses  to
          encrypt the output of the processing job. The default is none.

       --enable-managed-spot-training    |   --no-enable-managed-spot-training
       (boolean)
          Optimizes the cost of training machine-learning models by using Ama-
          zon Elastic Compute Cloud spot instances. The default is False .

       --custom-model-training-parameters (structure)
          The configuration for custom model training. This is a JSON object.

          sourceS3DirectoryPath -> (string)
              The  path  to the Amazon S3 location where the Python module im-
              plementing your model is located. This must point to a valid ex-
              isting  Amazon S3 location that contains, at a minimum, a train-
              ing script,  a  transform  script,  and  a  model-hpo-configura-
              tion.json file.

          trainingEntryPointScript -> (string)
              The name of the entry point in your module of a script that per-
              forms model training and takes hyperparameters  as  command-line
              arguments,  including  fixed  hyperparameters.  The  default  is
              training.py .

          transformEntryPointScript -> (string)
              The name of the entry point in your  module  of  a  script  that
              should  be  run  after  the  best  model from the hyperparameter
              search has been identified, to compute the model artifacts  nec-
              essary  for  model  deployment. It should be able to run with no
              command-line arguments.The default is transform.py .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          sourceS3DirectoryPath=string,trainingEntryPointScript=string,transformEntryPointScript=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "sourceS3DirectoryPath": "string",
            "trainingEntryPointScript": "string",
            "transformEntryPointScript": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.
