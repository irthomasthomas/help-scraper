OPTIONS
       --source (string)
          The  source  parameter  accepts  an  S3 URI that identifies a single
          file, multiple files, a folder, or multiple folders.  Neptune  loads
          every data file in any folder that is specified.

          The URI can be in any of the following formats.

          o s3://(bucket_name)/(object-key-name)

          o https://s3.amazonaws.com/(bucket_name)/(object-key-name)

          o https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/(bucket_name)/(object-key-name)

          The  object-key-name  element of the URI is equivalent to the prefix
          parameter in an S3 ListObjects API call. It identifies all  the  ob-
          jects in the specified S3 bucket whose names begin with that prefix.
          That can be a single file or folder, or multiple files and/or  fold-
          ers.

          The  specified  folder  or folders can contain multiple vertex files
          and multiple edge files.

       --format (string)
          The format of the data. For more information about data formats  for
          the Neptune Loader command, see Load Data Formats .

       --s3-bucket-region (string)
          The  Amazon  region of the S3 bucket. This must match the Amazon Re-
          gion of the DB cluster.

          Possible values:

          o us-east-1

          o us-gov-west-1

          o us-gov-east-1

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an IAM role to be assumed by  the
          Neptune  DB  instance  for access to the S3 bucket. The IAM role ARN
          provided here should be attached to the DB cluster (see  Adding  the
          IAM Role to an Amazon Neptune Cluster .

       --mode (string)
          The load job mode.
              Allowed values : RESUME , NEW , AUTO .

              Default value : AUTO .

          o RESUME   In RESUME mode, the loader looks for a previous load from
            this source, and if it finds one, resumes that  load  job.  If  no
            previous  load  job  is found, the loader stops. The loader avoids
            reloading files that were successfully loaded in a  previous  job.
            It  only  tries to process failed files. If you dropped previously
            loaded data from your Neptune cluster, that data is  not  reloaded
            in  this  mode.  If  a previous load job loaded all files from the
            same source successfully, nothing is reloaded, and the loader  re-
            turns success.

          o NEW  In NEW mode, the creates a new load request regardless of any
            previous loads. You can use this mode to reload all the data  from
            a  source  after dropping previously loaded data from your Neptune
            cluster, or to load new data available at the same source.

          o AUTO  In AUTO mode, the loader looks for a previous load job  from
            the same source, and if it finds one, resumes that job, just as in
            RESUME mode. If the loader doesn't find a previous load  job  from
            the same source, it loads all data from the source, just as in NEW
            mode.

          Possible values:

          o RESUME

          o NEW

          o AUTO

       --fail-on-error | --no-fail-on-error (boolean)
              ** failOnError **  A flag to toggle a complete stop on an error.

              Allowed values : "TRUE" , "FALSE" .

              Default value : "TRUE" .

          When this parameter is set to "FALSE" , the loader tries to load all
          the  data  in  the location specified, skipping any entries with er-
          rors.

          When this parameter is set to "TRUE" , the loader stops as  soon  as
          it encounters an error. Data loaded up to that point persists.

       --parallelism (string)
          The  optional  parallelism parameter can be set to reduce the number
          of threads used by the bulk load process.
              Allowed values :

          o LOW  The number of threads used is the number of  available  vCPUs
            divided by 8.

          o MEDIUM   The number of threads used is the number of available vC-
            PUs divided by 2.

          o HIGH  The number of threads used is the  same  as  the  number  of
            available vCPUs.

          o OVERSUBSCRIBE   The number of threads used is the number of avail-
            able vCPUs multiplied by 2. If this value is used, the bulk loader
            takes  up  all  available  resources. This does not mean, however,
            that the OVERSUBSCRIBE setting results in  100%  CPU  utilization.
            Because  the load operation is I/O bound, the highest CPU utiliza-
            tion to expect is in the 60% to 70% range.
              Default value : HIGH

          The parallelism setting can sometimes result in a  deadlock  between
          threads when loading openCypher data. When this happens, Neptune re-
          turns the LOAD_DATA_DEADLOCK error. You can generally fix the  issue
          by setting parallelism to a lower setting and retrying the load com-
          mand.

          Possible values:

          o LOW

          o MEDIUM

          o HIGH

          o OVERSUBSCRIBE

       --parser-configuration (map)
              ** parserConfiguration **  An optional  object  with  additional
              parser  configuration  values.  Each  of the child parameters is
              also optional:

          o

            **
            namedGraphUri **  The default graph for all RDF  formats  when  no
            graph  is  specified (for non-quads formats and NQUAD entries with
            no  graph).  The  default  is   https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/vo-
            cab/v01/DefaultNamedGraph .

            **
            allowEmptyStrings **  Gremlin users need to be able to pass  empty
            string  values("")  as  node  and edge properties when loading CSV
            data. If allowEmptyStrings is set to  false  (the  default),  such
            empty  strings  are  treated  as  nulls and are not loaded. If al-
            lowEmptyStrings is set to true , the loader treats  empty  strings
            as valid property values and loads them accordingly.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --update-single-cardinality-properties  |  --no-update-single-cardinal-
       ity-properties (boolean)
              updateSingleCardinalityProperties is an optional parameter  that
              controls  how the bulk loader treats a new value for single-car-
              dinality vertex or edge properties. This is  not  supported  for
              loading openCypher data.

              Allowed values : "TRUE" , "FALSE" .

              Default value : "FALSE" .

          By  default, or when updateSingleCardinalityProperties is explicitly
          set to "FALSE" , the loader treats a new value as an error,  because
          it violates single cardinality.

          When  updateSingleCardinalityProperties  is  set  to "TRUE" , on the
          other hand, the bulk loader replaces the existing value with the new
          one.  If  multiple edge or single-cardinality vertex property values
          are provided in the source file(s) being loaded, the final value  at
          the  end  of the bulk load could be any one of those new values. The
          loader only guarantees that the existing value has been replaced  by
          one of the new ones.

       --queue-request | --no-queue-request (boolean)
          This  is  an optional flag parameter that indicates whether the load
          request can be queued up or not.

          You don't have to wait for one load job to complete  before  issuing
          the  next  one, because Neptune can queue up as many as 64 jobs at a
          time, provided that their queueRequest parameters  are  all  set  to
          "TRUE" .

          If  the  queueRequest  parameter  is omitted or set to "FALSE" , the
          load request will fail if another load job is already running.
              Allowed values : "TRUE" , "FALSE" .

              Default value : "FALSE" .

       --dependencies (list)
          This is an optional parameter that can make a  queued  load  request
          contingent on the successful completion of one or more previous jobs
          in the queue.

          Neptune can queue up as many as 64 load requests at a time, if their
          queueRequest parameters are set to "TRUE" . The dependencies parame-
          ter lets you make execution of such a queued  request  dependent  on
          the successful completion of one or more specified previous requests
          in the queue.

          For example, if load Job-A and Job-B are independent of each  other,
          but  load  Job-C  needs Job-A and Job-B to be finished before it be-
          gins, proceed as follows:

          o Submit load-job-A and load-job-B one after another in  any  order,
            and save their load-ids.

          o Submit  load-job-C with the load-ids of the two jobs in its depen-
            dencies field:

          Because of the dependencies parameter,  the  bulk  loader  will  not
          start  Job-C  until  Job-A and Job-B have completed successfully. If
          either one of them fails, Job-C will not be executed, and its status
          will be set to LOAD_FAILED_BECAUSE_DEPENDENCY_NOT_SATISFIED .

          You  can  set  up multiple levels of dependency in this way, so that
          the failure of one job will cause all requests that are directly  or
          indirectly dependent on it to be cancelled.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --user-provided-edge-ids | --no-user-provided-edge-ids (boolean)
          This  parameter  is  required only when loading openCypher data that
          contains relationship IDs. It must be included and set to True  when
          openCypher relationship IDs are explicitly provided in the load data
          (recommended).

          When userProvidedEdgeIds is absent or set to True ,  an  :ID  column
          must be present in every relationship file in the load.

          When  userProvidedEdgeIds is present and set to False , relationship
          files in the load must not contain an :ID column. Instead, the  Nep-
          tune loader automatically generates an ID for each relationship.

          It's  useful  to  provide  relationship  IDs  explicitly so that the
          loader can resume loading after error in  the  CSV  data  have  been
          fixed,  without having to reload any relationships that have already
          been loaded. If relationship IDs have not been explicitly  assigned,
          the  loader cannot resume a failed load if any relationship file has
          had to be corrected, and must instead reload all the relationships.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
