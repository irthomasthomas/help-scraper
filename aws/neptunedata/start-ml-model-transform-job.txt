       --model-transform-output-s3-location (string)
          The  location  in  Amazon  S3  where  the  model artifacts are to be
          stored.

       --sagemaker-iam-role-arn (string)
          The ARN of an IAM role for SageMaker execution. This must be  listed
          in your DB cluster parameter group or an error will occur.

       --neptune-iam-role-arn (string)
          The ARN of an IAM role that provides Neptune access to SageMaker and
          Amazon S3 resources. This must be listed in your DB cluster  parame-
          ter group or an error will occur.

       --custom-model-transform-parameters (structure)
          Configuration  information  for  a  model  transform  using a custom
          model. The customModelTransformParameters object contains  the  fol-
          lowing  fields,  which  must  have  values compatible with the saved
          model parameters from the training job:

          sourceS3DirectoryPath -> (string)
              The path to the Amazon S3 location where the Python  module  im-
              plementing your model is located. This must point to a valid ex-
              isting Amazon S3 location that contains, at a minimum, a  train-
              ing  script,  a  transform  script,  and  a model-hpo-configura-
              tion.json file.

          transformEntryPointScript -> (string)
              The name of the entry point in your  module  of  a  script  that
              should  be  run  after  the  best  model from the hyperparameter
              search has been identified, to compute the model artifacts  nec-
              essary  for  model  deployment. It should be able to run with no
              command-line arguments. The default is transform.py .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          sourceS3DirectoryPath=string,transformEntryPointScript=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "sourceS3DirectoryPath": "string",
            "transformEntryPointScript": "string"
          }

       --base-processing-instance-type (string)
          The type of ML instance used in preparing and managing  training  of
          ML models. This is an ML compute instance chosen based on memory re-
          quirements for processing the training data and model.

       --base-processing-instance-volume-size-in-gb (integer)
          The disk volume size of the training instance in gigabytes. The  de-
          fault is 0. Both input data and the output model are stored on disk,
          so the volume size must be large enough to hold both data  sets.  If
          not  specified  or 0, Neptune ML selects a disk volume size based on
          the recommendation generated in the data processing step.

       --subnets (list)
          The IDs of the subnets in the Neptune VPC. The default is None.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --security-group-ids (list)
          The VPC security group IDs. The default is None.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --volume-encryption-kms-key (string)
          The Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) key that SageMaker  uses  to
          encrypt  data  on  the storage volume attached to the ML compute in-
          stances that run the training job. The default is None.

       --s3-output-encryption-kms-key (string)
          The Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) key that SageMaker  uses  to
          encrypt the output of the processing job. The default is none.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

          The unique ID of the new model transform job.

       arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the model transform job.
