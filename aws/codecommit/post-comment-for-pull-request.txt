OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The  system-generated  ID  of  the pull request. To get this ID, use
          ListPullRequests .

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository where you want to post  a  comment  on  a
          pull request.

       --before-commit-id (string)
          The  full commit ID of the commit in the destination branch that was
          the tip of the branch at the time the pull request was created.

       --after-commit-id (string)
          The full commit ID of the commit in the source branch  that  is  the
          current  tip  of  the  branch for the pull request when you post the
          comment.

       --location (structure)
          The location of the change where you want to post your  comment.  If
          no  location is provided, the comment is posted as a general comment
          on the pull request difference between the before commit ID and  the
          after commit ID.

          filePath -> (string)
              The name of the file being compared, including its extension and
              subdirectory, if any.

          filePosition -> (long)
              The position of a change in a compared file, in line number for-
              mat.

          relativeFileVersion -> (string)
              In a comparison of commits or a pull request, whether the change
              is in the before or after of that comparison.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          filePath=string,filePosition=long,relativeFileVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "filePath": "string",
            "filePosition": long,
            "relativeFileVersion": "BEFORE"|"AFTER"
          }

       --content (string)
          The content of your comment on the change.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique, client-generated idempotency token that, when provided  in
          a request, ensures the request cannot be repeated with a changed pa-
          rameter. If a request is received with the same parameters and a to-
          ken  is  included, the request returns information about the initial
          request that used that token.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       change  to the ahs_count.py file in a pull request with the ID of 47 in
       a repository named MyDemoRepo.
