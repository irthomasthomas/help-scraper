BATCH-GET-REPOSITORIES()                              BATCH-GET-REPOSITORIES()



NAME
       batch-get-repositories -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about one or more repositories.

       NOTE:
          The  description  field for a repository accepts all HTML characters
          and all valid Unicode characters. Applications that do not  HTML-en-
          code the description and display it in a webpage can expose users to
          potentially malicious code. Make sure that you HTML-encode  the  de-
          scription field in any application that uses this API to display the
          repository description on a webpage.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-repositories
          --repository-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-names (list)
          The names of the repositories to get information about.

          NOTE:
              The length constraint limit is for each string in the array. The
              array itself can be empty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view details about multiple repositories

       This example shows details about multiple AWS CodeCommit repositories.
