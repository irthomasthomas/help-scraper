OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the file.

       --commit-specifier (string)
          The fully quaified reference that identifies the  commit  that  con-
          tains  the  file.  For  example, you can specify a full commit ID, a
          tag, a branch name, or a reference  such  as  refs/heads/master.  If
          none is provided, the head commit is used.

       --file-path (string)
          The  fully  qualified  path to the file, including the full name and
          extension of the file. For example, /examples/file.md is  the  fully
          qualified path to a file named file.md in a folder named examples.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  get  the  base-64  encoded  contents of a file in an AWS CodeCommit
       repository

       The following get-file example demonstrates how to get the base-64  en-
       coded  contents of a file named README.md from a branch named main in a
       repository named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit get-file \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo \
              --commit-specifier main \
              --file-path README.md

       Output:

          {
              "blobId":"559b44fEXAMPLE",
              "commitId":"c5709475EXAMPLE",
              "fileContent":"IyBQaHVzEXAMPLE",
              "filePath":"README.md",
              "fileMode":"NORMAL",
              "fileSize":1563
          }

       For more information, see GetFile in the AWS CodeCommit  API  Reference
       guide.

OUTPUT
       commitId -> (string)
          The  full commit ID of the commit that contains the content returned
          by GetFile.

       blobId -> (string)
          The blob ID of the object that represents the file content.

       filePath -> (string)
          The fully qualified path to the specified file. Returns the name and
          extension of the file.

       fileMode -> (string)
          The extrapolated file mode permissions of the blob. Valid values in-
          clude strings such as EXECUTABLE and not numeric values.

          NOTE:
              The file mode permissions returned by this API are not the stan-
              dard file mode permission values, such as 100644, but rather ex-
              trapolated values. See the supported return values.

       fileSize -> (long)
          The size of the contents of the file, in bytes.

       fileContent -> (blob)
          The base-64 encoded binary data object that represents  the  content
          of the file.
