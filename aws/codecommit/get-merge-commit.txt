OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  repository  that contains the merge commit about
          which you want to get information.

       --source-commit-specifier (string)
          The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified  reference  used  to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --destination-commit-specifier (string)
          The  branch,  tag,  HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --conflict-detail-level (string)
          The level of conflict detail to use.  If  unspecified,  the  default
          FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same
          file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a
          conflict  is  considered  not  mergeable  if  the  same file in both
          branches has differences on the same line.

          Possible values:

          o FILE_LEVEL

          o LINE_LEVEL

       --conflict-resolution-strategy (string)
          Specifies which branch to use when resolving conflicts,  or  whether
          to attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default
          is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before
          the merge operation is successful.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o ACCEPT_SOURCE

          o ACCEPT_DESTINATION

          o AUTOMERGE

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get detailed information about a merge commit

       The  following  get-merge-commit example displays details about a merge
       commit for the source branch named bugfix-bug1234  with  a  destination
       branch  named  main  using the THREE_WAY_MERGE strategy in a repository
       named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit get-merge-commit \
              --source-commit-specifier bugfix-bug1234 \
              --destination-commit-specifier main \
              --merge-option THREE_WAY_MERGE \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo

       Output:

          {
              "sourceCommitId": "c5709475EXAMPLE",
              "destinationCommitId": "317f8570EXAMPLE",
              "baseCommitId": "fb12a539EXAMPLE",
              "mergeCommitId": "ffc4d608eEXAMPLE"
          }

       For more information, see View Commit Details  in  the  AWS  CodeCommit
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       sourceCommitId -> (string)
          The  commit  ID  of the source commit specifier that was used in the
          merge evaluation.

       destinationCommitId -> (string)
          The commit ID of the destination commit specifier that was  used  in
          the merge evaluation.

       baseCommitId -> (string)
          The commit ID of the merge base.

       mergedCommitId -> (string)
          The  commit  ID  for the merge commit created when the source branch
          was merged into the destination branch. If  the  fast-forward  merge
          strategy was used, there is no merge commit.
