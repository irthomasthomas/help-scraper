OPTIONS
       --approval-rule-template-name (string)
          The name of the template you want to  associate  with  one  or  more
          repositories.

       --repository-names (list)
          The  names  of  the repositories you want to associate with the tem-
          plate.

          NOTE:
              The length constraint limit is for each string in the array. The
              array itself can be empty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  associate an approval rule template with multiple repositories in a
       single operation

       The following  batch-associate-approval-rule-template-with-repositories
       example associates the specified approval rule template with  reposito-
       ries named MyDemoRepo and MyOtherDemoRepo.

       Note: Approval rule templates are specific to the AWS Region where they
       are  created. They can only be associated with repositories in that AWS
       Region.

          aws codecommit batch-associate-approval-rule-template-with-repositories \
              --repository-names MyDemoRepo, MyOtherDemoRepo  \
              --approval-rule-template-name 2-approver-rule-for-main

       Output:

          {
              "associatedRepositoryNames": [
                  "MyDemoRepo",
                  "MyOtherDemoRepo"
              ],
              "errors": []
          }

       For more information, see Associate an Approval Rule  Template  with  a
       Repository in the AWS CodeCommit User Guide.

OUTPUT
       associatedRepositoryNames -> (list)

          the template.

          (string)

       errors -> (list)
          A list of any errors that might have occurred  while  attempting  to
          create the association between the template and the repositories.

          (structure)
              Returns  information  about  errors in a BatchAssociateApproval-
              RuleTemplateWithRepositories operation.

              repositoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the repository  where  the  association  was  not
                 made.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 An  error code that specifies whether the repository name was
