            get-repository-triggers
          --repository-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository for which the trigger is configured.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about triggers in a repository

       This example shows details about triggers configured for an  AWS  Code-
       Commit repository named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit get-repository-triggers \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo

       Output:

          {
              "configurationId": "f7579e13-b83e-4027-aaef-650c0EXAMPLE",
              "triggers": [
                  {
                      "destinationArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111111111111:MyCodeCommitTopic",
                      "branches": [
                          "main",
                          "preprod"

                      "customData": "",
                      "events": [
                          "all"
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "destinationArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:111111111111:function:MyCodeCommitPythonFunction",
                      "branches": [],
                      "name": "MySecondTrigger",
                      "customData": "EXAMPLE",

              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       configurationId -> (string)
          The system-generated unique ID for the trigger.

       triggers -> (list)
          The JSON block of configuration information for each trigger.

          (structure)
              Information about a trigger for a repository.

              NOTE:
                 If you want to receive notifications about repository events,
                 consider using notifications instead of  triggers.  For  more
                 information,  see  Configuring  notifications  for repository
                 events .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the trigger.

              destinationArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource that is the target for a trigger (for
                 example, the ARN of a topic in Amazon SNS).

              customData -> (string)
                 Any custom data associated with the trigger to be included in
                 the information sent to the target of the trigger.

              branches -> (list)
                 The branches to be included in the trigger configuration.  If
                 you  specify  an  empty  array,  the  trigger  applies to all
                 branches.

                 NOTE:
                     Although no content is required in the  array,  you  must
                     include the array itself.

                 (string)

              events -> (list)
                 The  repository  events that cause the trigger to run actions
                 in another service, such as sending  a  notification  through
                 Amazon SNS.

                 NOTE:
                     The  valid value "all" cannot be used with any other val-
                     ues.

                 (string)
