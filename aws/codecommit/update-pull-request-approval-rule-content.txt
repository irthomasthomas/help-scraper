       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-pull-request-approval-rule-content
          --pull-request-id <value>
          --approval-rule-name <value>
          [--existing-rule-content-sha256 <value>]
          --new-rule-content <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The system-generated ID of the pull request.

       --approval-rule-name (string)
          The name of the approval rule you want to update.

       --existing-rule-content-sha256 (string)
          The SHA-256 hash signature for the content of the approval rule. You
          can retrieve this information by using  GetPullRequest .

       --new-rule-content (string)
          The updated content for the approval rule.

          NOTE:
              When you update the content of the approval rule, you can  spec-
              ify approvers in an approval pool in one of two ways:

              o CodeCommitApprovers : This option only requires an AWS account
                and a resource. It can be used for both IAM users  and  feder-
                ated  access  users  whose  name matches the provided resource
                name. This is a very powerful option that offers a great  deal
                of  flexibility.  For  example, if you specify the AWS account
                123456789012 and Mary_Major , all of the following are counted
                as approvals coming from that user:

                o An   IAM  user  in  the  account  (arn:aws:iam::123456789012
                  :user/Mary_Major )

                o A  federated  user   identified   in   IAM   as   Mary_Major
                  (arn:aws:sts::123456789012 :federated-user/Mary_Major )

              This  option does not recognize an active session of someone as-
              suming the role of CodeCommitReview with a role session name  of
              Mary_Major   (arn:aws:sts::123456789012   :assumed-role/CodeCom-
              mitReview/Mary_Major ) unless you include a wildcard (
              *
              Mary_Major).

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 95)
                     Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

              o Fully qualified ARN : This option allows you  to  specify  the
                fully  qualified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user or
                role.

              For more information about IAM ARNs, wildcards, and formats, see
              IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To edit an approval rule for a pull request

       The following update-pull-request-approval-rule-content example updates
       she specified approval rule to require one user approval  from  an  ap-
       proval pool that includes any IAM user in the 123456789012 AWS account.
