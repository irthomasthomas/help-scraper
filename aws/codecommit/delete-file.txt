DESCRIPTION

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the file to delete.

       --branch-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  branch where the commit that deletes the file is
          made.

       --file-path (string)
          The fully qualified path to the file that to be  deleted,  including
          the  full  name  and  extension  of  that  file. For example, /exam-
          ples/file.md is a fully qualified path to a file named file.md in  a
          folder named examples.

       --parent-commit-id (string)
          The ID of the commit that is the tip of the branch where you want to
          create the commit that deletes the file. This must be the HEAD  com-
          mit for the branch. The commit that deletes the file is created from
          this commit ID.

       --keep-empty-folders | --no-keep-empty-folders (boolean)
          If a file is the only object in the folder or  directory,  specifies
          whether to delete the folder or directory that contains the file. By
          default, empty folders are deleted. This includes empty folders that
          are  part  of the directory structure. For example, if the path to a
          file is dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4, and dir2 and dir3 are  empty,  deleting
          the last file in dir4 also deletes the empty folders dir4, dir3, and
          dir2.

       --commit-message (string)
          The commit message you want to include as part of deleting the file.
          Commit messages are limited to 256 KB. If no message is specified, a
          default message is used.

       --name (string)
          The name of the author of the commit that deletes the  file.  If  no
          name  is  specified,  the  user's ARN is used as the author name and
          committer name.

       --email (string)
          The email address for the commit that deletes the file. If no  email
          address is specified, the email address is left blank.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a file

       The  following  delete-file  example  demonstrates how to delete a file
       named README.md from a branch named main with a most recent  commit  ID
       of c5709475EXAMPLE in a repository named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit delete-file \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo \
              --branch-name main \
              --file-path README.md \
              --parent-commit-id c5709475EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "blobId":"559b44fEXAMPLE",
              "commitId":"353cf655EXAMPLE",
              "filePath":"README.md",
              "treeId":"6bc824cEXAMPLE"
          }

       the AWS CodeCommit API Reference guide.
