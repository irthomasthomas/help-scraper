LIST-REPOSITORIES()                                        LIST-REPOSITORIES()



NAME
       list-repositories -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about one or more repositories.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-repositories  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: repositories

SYNOPSIS
            list-repositories
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          The criteria used to sort the results of a list repositories  opera-
          tion.

          Possible values:

          o repositoryName

          o lastModifiedDate

       --order (string)
          The order in which to sort the results of a list repositories opera-
          tion.

          Possible values:

          o ascending

          o descending

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view a list of repositories

       This example lists all AWS CodeCommit repositories associated with  the
       user's AWS account.

       Command:

          aws codecommit list-repositories

       Output:

          {
            "repositories": [
                {
                   "repositoryName": "MyDemoRepo"
                   "repositoryId": "f7579e13-b83e-4027-aaef-650c0EXAMPLE",
                },
                {
                   "repositoryName": "MyOtherDemoRepo"
                   "repositoryId": "cfc29ac4-b0cb-44dc-9990-f6f51EXAMPLE"
                }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       repositories -> (list)
          Lists the repositories called by the list repositories operation.

          (structure)
              Information about a repository name and ID.

              repositoryName -> (string)
                 The name associated with the repository.

              repositoryId -> (string)
                 The ID associated with the repository.

       nextToken -> (string)
          An  enumeration token that allows the operation to batch the results
          of the operation. Batch sizes are 1,000 for list  repository  opera-
          tions.  When  the client sends the token back to AWS CodeCommit, an-
          other page of 1,000 records is retrieved.
