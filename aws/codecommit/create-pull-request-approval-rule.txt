OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The  system-generated  ID  of the pull request for which you want to
          create the approval rule.

       --approval-rule-name (string)
          The name for the approval rule.

       --approval-rule-content (string)
          The content of the approval rule, including the number of  approvals
          needed  and the structure of an approval pool defined for approvals,
          if any. For more information about approval pools, see the  CodeCom-
          mit User Guide.

          NOTE:
              When  you create the content of the approval rule, you can spec-
              ify approvers in an approval pool in one of two ways:

              o CodeCommitApprovers : This option only requires an Amazon  Web
                Services  account  and a resource. It can be used for both IAM
                users and federated access users whose name matches  the  pro-
                vided  resource  name. This is a very powerful option that of-
                fers a great deal of flexibility. For example, if you  specify
                the  Amazon Web Services account 123456789012 and Mary_Major ,
                all of the following would be counted as approvals coming from
                that user:

                o An   IAM  user  in  the  account  (arn:aws:iam::123456789012
                  :user/Mary_Major )

                o A  federated  user   identified   in   IAM   as   Mary_Major
                  (arn:aws:sts::123456789012 :federated-user/Mary_Major )

              This  option does not recognize an active session of someone as-
              suming the role of CodeCommitReview with a role session name  of
              Mary_Major   (arn:aws:sts::123456789012   :assumed-role/CodeCom-
              mitReview/Mary_Major ) unless you include a wildcard (
              *
              Mary_Major).

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 99)
                     Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

              o Fully qualified ARN : This option allows you  to  specify  the
                fully  qualified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user or
                role.

              For more information about IAM ARNs, wildcards, and formats, see
              IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an approval rule for a pull request

       The  following create-pull-request-approval-rule example creates an ap-
       proval rule named  Require two approved  approvers  for  the  specified
       pull  request.  The rule specifies that two approvals are required from
       an approval pool. The pool includes all users who access CodeCommit  by
       assuming the role of  CodeCommitReview in the 123456789012 AWS account.
       It  also  includes  either  an  IAM  user  or  federated   user   named
       Nikhil_Jayashankar from the same AWS account.
