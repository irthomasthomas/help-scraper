CREATE-APPROVAL-RULE-TEMPLATE()                CREATE-APPROVAL-RULE-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       create-approval-rule-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a template for approval rules that can then be associated with
       one or more repositories in your Amazon Web Services account. When  you
       associate  a template with a repository, CodeCommit creates an approval
       rule that matches the conditions of the template for all pull  requests
       that  meet  the  conditions  of the template. For more information, see
       AssociateApprovalRuleTemplateWithRepository .

OPTIONS
       --approval-rule-template-name (string)
          The name of the approval rule template. Provide  descriptive  names,
          because this name is applied to the approval rules created automati-
          cally in associated repositories.

       --approval-rule-template-content (string)
          The content of the approval rule that is created on pull requests in
          associated repositories. If you specify one or more destination ref-
          erences (branches), approval rules  are  created  in  an  associated
          repository  only  if  their  destination references (branches) match
          those specified in the template.

          NOTE:
              When you create the content of the approval rule  template,  you
              can specify approvers in an approval pool in one of two ways:

              o CodeCommitApprovers  : This option only requires an Amazon Web
                Services account and a resource. It can be used for  both  IAM
                users  and  federated access users whose name matches the pro-
                vided resource name. This is a very powerful option  that  of-
                fers  a great deal of flexibility. For example, if you specify
                the Amazon Web Services account 123456789012 and Mary_Major  ,
                all of the following are counted as approvals coming from that
                user:

                o An  IAM  user  in  the  account   (arn:aws:iam::123456789012
                  :user/Mary_Major )

                o A   federated   user   identified   in   IAM  as  Mary_Major
                  (arn:aws:sts::123456789012 :federated-user/Mary_Major )

              This option does not recognize an active session of someone  as-
              suming  the role of CodeCommitReview with a role session name of
              Mary_Major   (arn:aws:sts::123456789012   :assumed-role/CodeCom-
              mitReview/Mary_Major ) unless you include a wildcard (
              *
              Mary_Major).

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 92)
                     Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

              o Fully  qualified  ARN  : This option allows you to specify the
                fully qualified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user  or
                role.

              For more information about IAM ARNs, wildcards, and formats, see
              IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

       --approval-rule-template-description (string)
          The description of the approval rule template. Consider providing  a
          description  that explains what this template does and when it might
          be appropriate to associate it with repositories.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an approval rule template

       The following create-approval-rule-template example creates an approval
       rule template named 2-approver-rule-for-main ``. The template  requires
       two users who assume the role of ``CodeCommitReview to approve any pull
       request before it can be merged to the main branch.

          aws codecommit create-approval-rule-template \
              --approval-rule-template-name 2-approver-rule-for-main \
              --approval-rule-template-description  "Requires two developers from the team to approve the pull request if the destination branch is main" \
              --approval-rule-template-content "{\"Version\": \"2018-11-08\",\"DestinationReferences\": [\"refs/heads/main\"],\"Statements\": [{\"Type\": \"Approvers\",\"NumberOfApprovalsNeeded\": 2,\"ApprovalPoolMembers\": [\"arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/CodeCommitReview/*\"]}]}"

       Output:

          {
              "approvalRuleTemplate": {
                  "approvalRuleTemplateName": "2-approver-rule-for-main",

                  "lastModifiedUser": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Mary_Major",
                  "approvalRuleTemplateDescription": "Requires two developers from the team to approve the pull request if the destination branch is main",
