NAME
       delete-pull-request-approval-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an approval rule from a specified pull request. Approval rules
       can be deleted from a pull request only if the pull  request  is  open,
       and  if  the  approval rule was created specifically for a pull request
       and not generated from an approval rule template  associated  with  the
       repository where the pull request was created. You cannot delete an ap-
       proval rule from a merged or closed pull request.

OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The system-generated ID of the pull request that  contains  the  ap-
          proval rule you want to delete.

       --approval-rule-name (string)
          The name of the approval rule you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete an approval rule for a pull request

       The following delete-pull-request-approval-rule example deletes the ap-
       proval rule named  My Approval Rule for the specified pull request.

          aws codecommit delete-pull-request-approval-rule  \
              --approval-rule-name "My Approval Rule"  \
              --pull-request-id 15

       Output:

          {
              "approvalRuleId": "077d8e8a8-EXAMPLE"
          }

       For more information, see Edit or Delete an Approval Rule  in  the  AWS
       CodeCommit User Guide.

OUTPUT
       approvalRuleId -> (string)
          The ID of the deleted approval rule.

          NOTE:
              If the approval rule was deleted in an earlier API call, the re-
              sponse is 200 OK without content.
