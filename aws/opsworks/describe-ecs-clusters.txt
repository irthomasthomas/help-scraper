DESCRIBE-ECS-CLUSTERS()                                DESCRIBE-ECS-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       describe-ecs-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  Amazon ECS clusters that are registered with a stack. If you
       specify only a stack ID, you can use the MaxResults and  NextToken  pa-
       rameters  to  paginate  the response. However, AWS OpsWorks Stacks cur-
       rently supports only one cluster per layer, so the  result  set  has  a
       maximum of one element.
          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions level for the stack  or  an  at-
          tached  policy  that explicitly grants permission. For more informa-
          tion about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       This call accepts only one resource-identifying parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-ecs-clusters is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: EcsClusters

OPTIONS
       --ecs-cluster-arns (list)
          A list of ARNs, one for each cluster to be described.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --stack-id (string)
          A stack ID. DescribeEcsClusters returns a description of the cluster
          that is registered with the stack.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EcsClusters -> (list)
          A list of EcsCluster objects containing the cluster descriptions.

          (structure)
              Describes a registered Amazon ECS cluster.

              EcsClusterArn -> (string)
                 The cluster's ARN.

              EcsClusterName -> (string)
                 The cluster name.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The stack ID.

              RegisteredAt -> (string)
                 The time and date that the cluster was  registered  with  the
                 stack.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If a paginated request does not return all of the remaining results,
          this parameter is set to a token that you can assign to the  request
          object's NextToken parameter to retrieve the next set of results. If
          the previous paginated request returned all  of  the  remaining  re-
          sults, this parameter is set to null .
