       Shorthand Syntax:

          Monday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Tuesday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Wednesday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Thursday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Friday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Saturday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Sunday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Monday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Tuesday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Wednesday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Thursday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Friday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Saturday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Sunday": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set the time-based scaling configuration for a layer

       The following example sets the time-based configuration for a specified
       instance.   You  must  first use create-instance to add the instance to
       the layer.

          aws opsworks --region us-east-1 set-time-based-auto-scaling --instance-id 69b6237c-08c0-4edb-a6af-78f3d01cedf2 --auto-scaling-schedule file://schedule.json

       The example puts the schedule in a separate file in the working  direc-
       tory  named  schedule.json.  For this example, the instance is on for a
       few hours around midday UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on Monday  and
       Tuesday.

          {
            "Monday": {
              "10": "on",
              "11": "on",
              "12": "on",
              "13": "on"
            },
            "Tuesday": {
              "10": "on",
              "11": "on",
              "12": "on",
              "13": "on"
            }
          }

       Output: None.
