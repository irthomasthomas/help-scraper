OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The app stack ID. If you use this parameter, DescribeApps returns  a
          description of the apps in the specified stack.

       --app-ids (list)
          An  array  of  app IDs for the apps to be described. If you use this
          parameter, DescribeApps returns a description of the specified apps.
          Otherwise, it returns a description of every app.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                     you to easily deploy new versions of an application.  One
                     of  the  simplest approaches is to have branches or revi-
                     sions in your repository that  represent  different  ver-
                     sions that can potentially be deployed.

              Environment -> (list)
                 An array of EnvironmentVariable objects that specify environ-
                 ment  variables  to be associated with the app. After you de-
                 ploy the app, these variables are defined on  the  associated
                 app  server  instances. For more information, see Environment
                 Variables .

                 NOTE:
                     There is no specific limit on the number  of  environment
                     variables.  However,  the  size  of  the  associated data
                     structure - which includes the  variable  names,  values,
                     and  protected  flag  values  - cannot exceed 20 KB. This
                     limit should accommodate most if not all use  cases,  but
                     if  you  do  exceed it, you will cause an exception (API)
                     with an "Environment: is too large (maximum  is  20  KB)"
                     message.

                 (structure)
                     Represents an app's environment variable.

                     Key -> (string)
                        (Required)  The environment variable's name, which can
                        consist of up to 64 characters and must be  specified.
                        The  name  can  contain  upper- and lowercase letters,
                        numbers, and underscores (_), but it must start with a
                        letter or underscore.

                     Value -> (string)
                        (Optional) The environment variable's value, which can
                        be left empty. If you specify a value, it can  contain
                        up to 256 characters, which must all be printable.

                     Secure -> (boolean)
                        (Optional)  Whether  the  variable's value will be re-
                        turned by the  DescribeApps action. To conceal an  en-
                        vironment  variable's  value, set Secure to true . De-
                        scribeApps then returns *****FILTERED***** instead  of
                        the  actual  value.  The  default  value for Secure is
                        false .
