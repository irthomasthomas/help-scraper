OPTIONS
       --layer-ids (list)
          An array of layer IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a layer's load-based scaling configuration

       The following example describes a specified layer's load-based  scaling
       configuration.   The layer is identified by its layer ID, which you can
       find on the layer's details page or by running describe-layers.

          aws opsworks describe-load-based-auto-scaling --region us-east-1 --layer-ids 6bec29c9-c866-41a0-aba5-fa3e374ce2a1

       Output: The example layer has a single load-based instance.

          {
            "LoadBasedAutoScalingConfigurations": [
              {
                "DownScaling": {
                  "IgnoreMetricsTime": 10,
                  "ThresholdsWaitTime": 10,

OUTPUT
       LoadBasedAutoScalingConfigurations -> (list)
          An  array of LoadBasedAutoScalingConfiguration objects that describe
          each layer's configuration.

          (structure)
              Describes a layer's load-based auto scaling configuration.

              LayerId -> (string)
                 The layer ID.

              Enable -> (boolean)
                 Whether load-based auto scaling is enabled for the layer.

              UpScaling -> (structure)
                 An AutoScalingThresholds object that describes the  upscaling
                 configuration, which defines how and when AWS OpsWorks Stacks
                 increases the number of instances.

                 InstanceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of instances to add or remove  when  the  load
                     exceeds a threshold.

                 ThresholdsWaitTime -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in minutes, that the load must exceed
                     a threshold before more instances are added or removed.

                 IgnoreMetricsTime -> (integer)
                     The amount of time (in minutes) after a scaling event oc-
                     curs  that  AWS OpsWorks Stacks should ignore metrics and
                     suppress additional  scaling  events.  For  example,  AWS
                     OpsWorks Stacks adds new instances following an upscaling
                     event but the instances won't start reducing the load un-
                     til  they  have  been  booted and configured. There is no
                     point in raising additional scaling  events  during  that
                     operation, which typically takes several minutes. Ignore-
                     MetricsTime allows you to direct AWS OpsWorks  Stacks  to
                     suppress  scaling  events  long enough to get the new in-
                     stances online.

                 CpuThreshold -> (double)
                     The CPU utilization threshold, as a percent of the avail-
                     able CPU. A value of -1 disables the threshold.

                 MemoryThreshold -> (double)
                     The  memory  utilization  threshold,  as a percent of the
                     available memory. A value of -1 disables the threshold.

                 LoadThreshold -> (double)
                     The load threshold. A value of -1 disables the threshold.

                     (computing) .

                 Alarms -> (list)
                     Custom Cloudwatch auto scaling  alarms,  to  be  used  as
                     thresholds.  This  parameter  takes  a list of up to five
                     alarm names, which are case sensitive and must be in  the
                     same region as the stack.

                     NOTE:
                        To  use  custom  alarms,  you must update your service
                        role to allow cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms . You can  ei-
                        ther  have AWS OpsWorks Stacks update the role for you
                        when you first use this feature or you  can  edit  the
                        role  manually. For more information, see Allowing AWS
                        OpsWorks Stacks to Act on Your Behalf .

                     (string)

              DownScaling -> (structure)
                 An AutoScalingThresholds object that describes the  downscal-
                 ing  configuration,  which  defines how and when AWS OpsWorks
                 Stacks reduces the number of instances.

                 InstanceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of instances to add or remove  when  the  load
                     exceeds a threshold.

                 ThresholdsWaitTime -> (integer)
