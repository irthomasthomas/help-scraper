          Manage  permissions  level for the stack, or an attached policy that

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The stack ID.

       --iam-user-arn (string)
          The user's IAM ARN. This can also be a federated user's ARN.

       --allow-ssh | --no-allow-ssh (boolean)
          The user is allowed to use SSH to communicate with the instance.

       --allow-sudo | --no-allow-sudo (boolean)
          The user is allowed to use sudo to elevate privileges.

       --level (string)
          The user's permission level, which must be set to one of the follow-
          ing strings. You cannot set your own permissions level.

          o deny

          o show

          o deploy

          o manage

          o iam_only

          For more information about the  permissions  associated  with  these
          levels, see Managing User Permissions .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To grant per-stack AWS OpsWorks permission levels

       When you import an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)  user  into
       AWS  OpsWorks  by  calling create-user-profile, the user has only those
       permissions that are granted by the attached  IAM  policies.   You  can
       grant  AWS  OpsWorks  permissions by modifying a user's policies.  How-
       ever, it is often easier to import a user and then use the  set-permis-
       sion  command  to  grant the user one of the standard permission levels
       for each stack to which the user will need access.

       The following example grants permission for the specified stack  for  a
       user,  who  is  identified  by  Amazon Resource Name (ARN). The example
       grants the user a Manage permissions level, with sudo  and  SSH  privi-
       leges on the stack's instances.

          aws opsworks set-permission --region us-east-1 --stack-id 71c7ca72-55ae-4b6a-8ee1-a8dcded3fa0f --level manage  --iam-user-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789102:user/cli-user-test --allow-ssh --allow-sudo

       Output: None.
