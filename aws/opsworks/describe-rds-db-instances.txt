NAME
       describe-rds-db-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes Amazon RDS instances.
          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions level for the stack, or  an  at-
          tached  policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more informa-
          tion about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       This call accepts only one resource-identifying parameter.

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The ID of the stack with which the instances are registered. The op-
          eration returns descriptions of all registered Amazon RDS instances.

       --rds-db-instance-arns (list)
          An array containing the ARNs of the instances to be described.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a stack's registered Amazon RDS instances

       The following example describes the  Amazon  RDS  instances  registered
       with a specified stack.

          aws opsworks --region us-east-1 describe-rds-db-instances --stack-id d72553d4-8727-448c-9b00-f024f0ba1b06

       Output: The following is the output for a stack with one registered RDS
       instance.

          {
            "RdsDbInstances": [
              {
                "Engine": "mysql",
                "StackId": "d72553d4-8727-448c-9b00-f024f0ba1b06",
                "MissingOnRds": false,
                "Region": "us-west-2",
                "RdsDbInstanceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:db:clitestdb",
                "DbPassword": "*****FILTERED*****",
                "Address": "clitestdb.cdlqlk5uwd0k.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com",
                "DbUser": "cliuser",
                "DbInstanceIdentifier": "clitestdb"
              }
            ]
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       RdsDbInstances -> (list)
          An a array of RdsDbInstance objects that describe the instances.

          (structure)
              Describes an Amazon RDS instance.

              RdsDbInstanceArn -> (string)
                 The instance's ARN.

              DbInstanceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The database instance identifier.

              DbUser -> (string)
                 The master user name.

              DbPassword -> (string)
                 OpsWorks Stacks returns *****FILTERED***** instead of the ac-
                 tual value.

              Region -> (string)
                 The instance's Amazon Web Services Region.

              Address -> (string)
                 The instance's address.

              Engine -> (string)
                 The instance's database engine.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack with which the instance is registered.

              MissingOnRds -> (boolean)
                 Set to true if OpsWorks Stacks is unable to discover the Ama-
                 zon  RDS  instance.  OpsWorks Stacks attempts to discover the
                 instance only once. If this value is set to true ,  you  must
                 deregister the instance, and then register it again.
