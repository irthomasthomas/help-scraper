          (structure)
              Describes an app's data source.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  data  source's  type,  AutoSelectOpsworksMysqlInstance ,
                 OpsworksMysqlInstance , RdsDbInstance , or None .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The data source's ARN.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 The database name.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Arn=string,DatabaseName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "string",
              "Arn": "string",
              "DatabaseName": "string"

            ...
          ]

       --type (string)
          The app type. Each supported type is associated  with  a  particular
          layer.  For  example,  PHP  applications  are  associated with a PHP
          layer. OpsWorks Stacks deploys an  application  to  those  instances
          that  are  members of the corresponding layer. If your app isn't one
          of the standard types, or you prefer to implement  your  own  Deploy
          recipes, specify other .

          Possible values:

          o aws-flow-ruby

          o java

          o rails

          o php

          o nodejs

          o static

          o other

       --app-source (structure)
          A Source object that specifies the app repository.

          Type -> (string)
              The repository type.

          Url -> (string)
              The  source  URL.  The  following  is an example of an Amazon S3
              source                  URL:                  https://s3.amazon-
              aws.com/opsworks-demo-bucket/opsworks_cookbook_demo.tar.gz .

          Username -> (string)
              This parameter depends on the repository type.

              o For Amazon S3 bundles, set Username to the appropriate IAM ac-
                cess key ID.

              o For HTTP bundles, Git repositories, and  Subversion  reposito-
                ries, set Username to the user name.

          Password -> (string)
              When included in a request, the parameter depends on the reposi-
              tory type.

              o For Amazon S3 bundles, set Password to the appropriate IAM se-
                cret access key.

              o For  HTTP bundles and Subversion repositories, set Password to
                the password.

              For more information on how to safely  handle  IAM  credentials,
              see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html
              .

              In responses, OpsWorks Stacks returns *****FILTERED***** instead
              of the actual value.

          SshKey -> (string)
              In requests, the repository's SSH key.

              In responses, OpsWorks Stacks returns *****FILTERED***** instead
              of the actual value.

          Revision -> (string)
              The application's version. OpsWorks Stacks enables you to easily
              deploy new versions of an application. One of the  simplest  ap-
              proaches  is  to  have  branches or revisions in your repository
              that represent different versions that can  potentially  be  de-
              ployed.

          One or more user-defined key/value pairs to be added  to  the  stack
          attributes.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

          Where valid key names are:
            DocumentRoot
            RailsEnv
            AutoBundleOnDeploy
            AwsFlowRubySettings

       JSON Syntax:

          {"DocumentRoot"|"RailsEnv"|"AutoBundleOnDeploy"|"AwsFlowRubySettings": "string"
            ...}

       --environment (list)
          An  array  of  EnvironmentVariable  objects that specify environment
          variables to be associated with the app. After you deploy  the  app,
          these  variables  are defined on the associated app server instance.
          For more information, see Environment Variables .

          There is no specific limit on the number of  environment  variables.
          However,  the size of the associated data structure - which includes
          the variables' names, values, and protected flag values - cannot ex-
          ceed 20 KB. This limit should accommodate most if not all use cases.
          Exceeding it will cause an exception with the message, "Environment:
          is too large (maximum is 20KB)."

          NOTE:
              If  you  have  specified  one or more environment variables, you
              cannot modify the stack's Chef version.

          (structure)
              Represents an app's environment variable.

              Key -> (string)
                 (Required) The environment variable's name, which can consist
                 of  up  to  64 characters and must be specified. The name can
                 contain upper- and lowercase  letters,  numbers,  and  under-
                 scores (_), but it must start with a letter or underscore.

              Value -> (string)
                 (Optional)  The  environment  variable's  value, which can be
                 left empty. If you specify a value, it can contain up to  256
                 characters, which must all be printable.

              Secure -> (boolean)
                 (Optional)  Whether  the  variable's value is returned by the
                 DescribeApps action. To hide an environment variable's value,
                 set  Secure to true . DescribeApps returns *****FILTERED*****
                 instead of the actual value. The default value for Secure  is
                 false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Secure=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Secure": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create an app

       The  following  example  creates a PHP app named SimplePHPApp from code
       stored in a GitHub repository.  The command uses the shorthand form  of
       the application source definition.

          aws opsworks create-app \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --stack-id f6673d70-32e6-4425-8999-265dd002fec7 \
              --name SimplePHPApp \
              --type php \
              --app-source Type=git,Url=git://github.com/amazonwebservices/opsworks-demo-php-simple-app.git,Revision=version1

       Output:

          {
              "AppId": "6cf5163c-a951-444f-a8f7-3716be75f2a2"
          }

       Example 2: To create an app with an attached database

       The  following  example  creates a JSP app from code stored in .zip ar-
       chive in a public S3 bucket.  It attaches an RDS DB instance  to  serve
       as  the  app's data store. The application and database sources are de-
       fined in separate JSON files that are in the directory from  which  you
       run the command.

          aws opsworks create-app \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --stack-id 8c428b08-a1a1-46ce-a5f8-feddc43771b8 \
              --name SimpleJSP \
              --type java \
              --app-source file://appsource.json \
              --data-sources file://datasource.json

       The  application  source  information is in appsource.json and contains
       the following.

          {
              "Type": "archive",
              "Url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/opsworks-demo-assets/simplejsp.zip"
          }

       The database source information is in datasource.json and contains  the
       following.

          [
              {
                  "Type": "RdsDbInstance",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:db:clitestdb",
                  "DatabaseName": "mydb"
              }
          ]

       Note:  For  an  RDS DB instance, you must first use register-rds-db-in-
       stance to register the instance with the stack.  For MySQL  App  Server
       instances,  set Type to OpsworksMysqlInstance. These instances are cre-
       ated by AWS OpsWorks, so they do not have to be registered.

       Output:

          {
              "AppId": "26a61ead-d201-47e3-b55c-2a7c666942f8"
          }

       For more information, see Adding Apps in the AWS OpsWorks User Guide.

OUTPUT
       AppId -> (string)
          The app ID.
