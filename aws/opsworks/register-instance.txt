REGISTER-INSTANCE()                                        REGISTER-INSTANCE()



NAME
       register-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers instances that were created outside of OpsWorks Stacks with a
       specified stack.

       NOTE:
          We do not recommend using this action  to  register  instances.  The
          complete  registration  operation includes two tasks: installing the
          OpsWorks Stacks agent on the instance, and registering the  instance
          with  the  stack. RegisterInstance handles only the second step. You
          should instead use the CLI register command, which performs the  en-
          tire  registration  operation. For more information, see Registering
          an Instance with an OpsWorks Stacks Stack .

       Registered instances have the same requirements as instances  that  are
       created  by  using the  CreateInstance API. For example, registered in-
       stances must be running a supported Linux-based operating  system,  and
       they  must  have  a supported instance type. For more information about
       requirements for instances that you want to register, see Preparing the
       Instance .
          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Manage permissions level for the stack or an  attached  policy  that
          explicitly  grants permissions. For more information on user permis-
          sions, see Managing User Permissions .

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The ID of the stack that the instance is to be registered with.

       --hostname (string)
          The instance's host name. The following are character limits for in-
          stance host names.

          o Linux-based instances: 63 characters

          o Windows-based instances: 15 characters

       --public-ip (string)
          The instance's public IP address.

       --private-ip (string)
          The instance's private IP address.

       --rsa-public-key (string)
          The instances public RSA key. This key is used to encrypt communica-
          tion between the instance and the service.

       --rsa-public-key-fingerprint (string)
          The instances public RSA key fingerprint.

       --instance-identity (structure)
          An InstanceIdentity object that contains the instance's identity.

          Document -> (string)
              A JSON document that contains the metadata.

          Signature -> (string)
              A signature that can be used to verify the  document's  accuracy
              and authenticity.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Document=string,Signature=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Document": "string",
            "Signature": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
