RESOURCE-GROUPS()                                            RESOURCE-GROUPS()



NAME
       resource-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Resource Groups lets you organize Amazon Web Services resources such as
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, Amazon Relational Database Ser-
       vice  databases,  and Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets into groups
       using criteria that you define as tags. A resource group is  a  collec-
       tion  of  resources that match the resource types specified in a query,
       and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You can create a  group
       of resources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecy-
       cle stages, regions, application layers, or virtually any criteria. Re-
       source Groups enable you to automate management tasks, such as those in
       Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Automation  documents,  on  tag-re-
       lated  resources  in  Amazon  Web  Services  Systems Manager. Groups of
       tagged resources also let you quickly view a custom console  in  Amazon
       Web  Services  Systems  Manager  that shows Config compliance and other
       monitoring data about member resources.

       To create a resource group, build a resource query,  and  specify  tags
       that  identify  the  criteria that members of the group have in common.
       Tags are key-value pairs.

       For more information about Resource Groups,  see  the  Resource  Groups
       User Guide .
