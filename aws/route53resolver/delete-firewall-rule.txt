OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of the firewall rule group that you want to
          delete the rule from.

       --firewall-domain-list-id (string)
          The ID of the domain list that's used in the rule.

       --firewall-threat-protection-id (string)
          The ID that is created for a DNS Firewall Advanced rule.

       --qtype (string)
          The DNS query type that the rule you are deleting evaluates. Allowed
          values are;

          o A: Returns an IPv4 address.

          o AAAA: Returns an Ipv6 address.

          o CAA:  Restricts CAs that can create SSL/TLS certifications for the
            domain.

          o CNAME: Returns another domain name.

          o DS: Record that identifies the DNSSEC signing key of  a  delegated
            zone.

          o MX: Specifies mail servers.

          o NAPTR: Regular-expression-based rewriting of domain names.

          o NS: Authoritative name servers.

          o PTR: Maps an IP address to a domain name.

          o SOA: Start of authority record for the zone.

          o SPF: Lists the servers authorized to send emails from a domain.

          o SRV: Application specific values that identify servers.

          o TXT: Verifies email senders and application-specific values.

          o A  query  type you define by using the DNS type ID, for example 28
            for AAAA. The values must be defined as TYPENUMBER, where the NUM-
            BER can be 1-65334, for example, TYPE28. For more information, see
            List of DNS record types .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       FirewallRule -> (structure)
          The specification for the firewall rule that you just deleted.

          FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the Firewall rule group of the rule.

          FirewallDomainListId -> (string)
              The ID of the domain list that's used in the rule.

          FirewallThreatProtectionId -> (string)
              ID of the DNS Firewall Advanced rule.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the rule.

          Priority -> (integer)
              The  priority  of the rule in the rule group. This value must be
              unique within the rule group. DNS Firewall processes  the  rules
              in  a  rule group by order of priority, starting from the lowest
              setting.

          Action -> (string)
              The action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query when  it
              matches  one  of  the  domains  in  the rule's domain list, or a
              threat in a DNS Firewall Advanced rule:

              o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.  Not  available  for
                DNS Firewall Advanced rules.

              o ALERT  - Permit the request to go through but send an alert to
                the logs.

              o BLOCK - Disallow the request. If this is specified, additional
                handling details are provided in the rule's BlockResponse set-
                ting.

          BlockResponse -> (string)
              The way that you want DNS Firewall to block  the  request.  Used
              for the rule action setting BLOCK .

              o NODATA - Respond indicating that the query was successful, but
                no response is available for it.

              o NXDOMAIN - Respond indicating that the domain name  that's  in
                the query doesn't exist.

              o OVERRIDE - Provide a custom override in the response. This op-
                tion requires custom handling details in the rule's BlockOver-
                ride* settings.

          BlockOverrideDomain -> (string)
              The  custom  DNS  record  to send back in response to the query.
              Used for the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse  setting  of
              OVERRIDE .

          BlockOverrideDnsType -> (string)
              The  DNS record's type. This determines the format of the record
              value that you provided in BlockOverrideDomain .  Used  for  the
              rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          BlockOverrideTtl -> (integer)
              The recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver
              or web browser to cache the provided override record.  Used  for
              the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string defined by you to identify the request. This al-
              lows you to retry failed requests without the risk of  executing
              the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for example,
              a timestamp.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the rule was created, in Unix time format
              and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The  date and time that the rule was last modified, in Unix time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          FirewallDomainRedirectionAction -> (string)
              How you want the the rule to evaluate DNS redirection in the DNS
              redirection chain, such as CNAME or DNAME.
                 INSPECT_REDIRECTION_DOMAIN  :  (Default) inspects all domains
                 in the redirection chain. The individual domains in the redi-
                 rection chain must be added to the domain list.

                 TRUST_REDIRECTION_DOMAIN  : Inspects only the first domain in
                 the redirection chain. You don't need to add  the  subsequent
                 domains  in  the domain in the redirection list to the domain
                 list.

          Qtype -> (string)
              The DNS query type you want the rule to evaluate. Allowed values
              are;

              o A: Returns an IPv4 address.

              o AAAA: Returns an Ipv6 address.

              o CAA:  Restricts CAs that can create SSL/TLS certifications for
                the domain.

              o CNAME: Returns another domain name.

              o DS: Record that identifies the DNSSEC signing key of  a  dele-
                gated zone.

              o MX: Specifies mail servers.

              o NAPTR: Regular-expression-based rewriting of domain names.

              o PTR: Maps an IP address to a domain name.

              o SOA: Start of authority record for the zone.

              o SPF:  Lists  the  servers authorized to send emails from a do-
                main.

              o SRV: Application specific values that identify servers.

              o TXT: Verifies email senders and application-specific values.

              o A query type you define by using the DNS type ID, for  example
                28  for  AAAA. The values must be defined as TYPENUMBER, where
                the NUMBER can be 1-65334, for example, TYPE28. For  more  in-
                formation, see List of DNS record types .

          DnsThreatProtection -> (string)
              The type of the DNS Firewall Advanced rule. Valid values are:

              o DGA : Domain generation algorithms detection. DGAs are used by
                attackers to generate a large number of domains to  to  launch
                malware attacks.

              o DNS_TUNNELING : DNS tunneling detection. DNS tunneling is used
                by attackers to exfiltrate data from the client by  using  the
                DNS tunnel without making a network connection to the client.

          ConfidenceThreshold -> (string)
              The  confidence  threshold  for  DNS Firewall Advanced. You must
              provide this value when you create a DNS Firewall Advanced rule.
              The confidence level values mean:

              o LOW  :  Provides  the  highest detection rate for threats, but
                also increases false positives.

              o MEDIUM : Provides a  balance  between  detecting  threats  and
                false positives.

              o HIGH  : Detects only the most well corroborated threats with a
                low rate of false positives.
