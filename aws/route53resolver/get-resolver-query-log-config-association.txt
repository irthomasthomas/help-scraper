NAME
       get-resolver-query-log-config-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a specified association between a Resolver query
       logging configuration and an Amazon VPC. When you associate a VPC  with
       a query logging configuration, Resolver logs DNS queries that originate
       in that VPC.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --resolver-query-log-config-association-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver query logging configuration association  that
          you want to get information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociation -> (structure)
          Information  about the Resolver query logging configuration associa-
          tion that you specified in a GetQueryLogConfigAssociation request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the query logging association.

          ResolverQueryLogConfigId -> (string)
              The ID of the query logging configuration that a VPC is  associ-
              ated with.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              The  ID of the Amazon VPC that is associated with the query log-
              ging configuration.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the specified  query  logging  association.  Valid
              values include the following:

              o CREATING : Resolver is creating an association between an Ama-
                zon VPC and a query logging configuration.

              o CREATED : The association between an Amazon VPC  and  a  query
                logging  configuration  was  successfully created. Resolver is
                logging queries that originate in the specified VPC.

              o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this  query  logging  associa-
                tion.

              o FAILED  :  Resolver  either couldn't create or couldn't delete
                the query logging association.

          Error -> (string)
              If the value of Status is FAILED , the value of Error  indicates
              the cause:

              o DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND  :  The specified destination (for exam-
                ple, an Amazon S3 bucket) was deleted.

              o ACCESS_DENIED : Permissions don't allow sending  logs  to  the
                destination.

              If  the  value of Status is a value other than FAILED , Error is
              null.

          ErrorMessage -> (string)
              Contains additional information about the error. If the value or
              Error is null, the value of ErrorMessage also is null.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time  that the VPC was associated with the query
              logging configuration, in Unix time format and Coordinated  Uni-
              versal Time (UTC).
