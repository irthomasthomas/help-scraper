DISASSOCIATE-RESOLVER-RULE()                      DISASSOCIATE-RESOLVER-RULE()



NAME
       disassociate-resolver-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the association between a specified Resolver rule and a speci-
       fied VPC.

       WARNING:
          If you disassociate a Resolver rule from a VPC, Resolver stops  for-
          warding  DNS  queries  for the domain name that you specified in the
          Resolver rule.

OPTIONS
       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC that you want to disassociate  the  Resolver  rule
          from.

       --resolver-rule-id (string)
          The  ID  of the Resolver rule that you want to disassociate from the
          specified VPC.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disassociate a Resolver rule from an Amazon VPC

       The  following  disassociate-resolver-rule example removes the associa-
       tion between the specified Resolver rule and the specified VPC. You can
       disassociate a rule from a VPC in the following circumstances:

       o For DNS queries that originate in this VPC, you want Resolver to stop
         forwarding queries to your network for the domain name that is speci-
         fied in the rule.

       o You  want to delete the forwarding rule. If a rule is currently asso-
         ciated with one or more VPCs, you must disassociate the rule from all
         VPCs before you can delete it.

            aws route53resolver disassociate-resolver-rule \
                --resolver-rule-id rslvr-rr-4955cb98ceexample \
                --vpc-id vpc-304bexam

       Output:

          {
              "ResolverRuleAssociation": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-rrassoc-322f4e8b9cexample",

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the association between a Resolver rule and a VPC. Re-

              AssociateResolverRule request.

          ResolverRuleId -> (string)
              The ID of the Resolver rule that you  associated  with  the  VPC
              that is specified by VPCId .

              The ID of the VPC that you associated the Resolver rule with.

          Status -> (string)
              A  code that specifies the current status of the association be-
              tween a Resolver rule and a VPC.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of the association  between
