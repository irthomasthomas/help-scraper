OPTIONS
       --resource-id (string)
          Resource ID of the Amazon VPC  that  you  want  to  get  information
          about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

OUTPUT
       ResolverConfig -> (structure)
          Information about the behavior configuration of  Route  53  Resolver
          behavior for the VPC you specified in the GetResolverConfig request.

          Id -> (string)
              ID for the Resolver configuration.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              The  ID of the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPC that you're con-
              figuring Resolver for.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The owner account ID of the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPC.

          AutodefinedReverse -> (string)
              The status of whether or not the Resolver  will  create  autode-

              The status can be one of following:

              Status of the rules generated by VPCs based on  CIDR/Region  for
              reverse DNS resolution. The status can be one of following:

              o ENABLING:  Autodefined rules for reverse DNS lookups are being
                enabled but are not complete.

              o ENABLED: Autodefined rules for reverse  DNS  lookups  are  en-
                abled.

              o DISABLING: Autodefined rules for reverse DNS lookups are being
                disabled but are not complete.

              o DISABLED: Autodefined rules for reverse DNS lookups  are  dis-
                abled.
