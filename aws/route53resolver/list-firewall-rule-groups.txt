LIST-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUPS()                        LIST-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-firewall-rule-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  minimal high-level information for the rule groups that
       you have defined.

       A single call might return only a partial list of the rule groups.  For
       information, see MaxResults .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-firewall-rule-groups  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: FirewallRuleGroups

SYNOPSIS
            list-firewall-rule-groups
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a list of your Firewall rule groups

       The following list-firewall-rule-groups example lists your DNS Firewall
       rule groups.

          aws route53resolver list-firewall-rule-groups

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRuleGroups": [
                  {
                      "Id": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-rule-group/rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                      "Name": "test",
                      "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "CreatorRequestId": "my-request-id",
                      "ShareStatus": "NOT_SHARED"
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Managing rule groups and rules in  DNS  Fire-
       wall in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns this
          token in the response. To retrieve the next batch of  objects,  pro-
          vide this token in your next request.

       FirewallRuleGroups -> (list)
          A list of your firewall rule groups.

          This  might  be  a partial list of the rule groups that you have de-
          fined. For information, see MaxResults .

          (structure)
              Minimal high-level information for a firewall  rule  group.  The
              action   ListFirewallRuleGroups  returns  an  array of these ob-
              jects.

              To retrieve full information for a  firewall  rule  group,  call
              GetFirewallRuleGroup and  ListFirewallRules .

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the rule group.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the rule group.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule group.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that cre-
                 ated the rule group. When a rule group is  shared  with  your
                 account,  this  is the account that has shared the rule group
                 with you.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A unique string defined by you to identify the request.  This
                 allows  you to retry failed requests without the risk of run-
                 ning the operation twice. This can be any unique string,  for
                 example, a timestamp.

              ShareStatus -> (string)
                 Whether  the  rule group is shared with other Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices accounts, or was shared with the current account by an-
                 other  Amazon  Web  Services  account.  Sharing is configured
                 through Resource Access Manager (RAM).
