OPTIONS
       --resource-id (string)
          Resource ID of the Amazon VPC that you want to update  the  Resolver
          configuration for.

       --autodefined-reverse-flag (string)
          Indicates  whether or not the Resolver will create autodefined rules
          for reverse DNS lookups. This is enabled by default. Disabling  this
          option will also affect EC2-Classic instances using ClassicLink. For
          more information, see ClassicLink in the Amazon EC2 guide .

          WARNING:
              We are retiring EC2-Classic on August  15,  2022.  We  recommend
              that  you  migrate  from EC2-Classic to a VPC. For more informa-
              tion, see Migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC in  the  Amazon  EC2
              guide and the blog EC2-Classic Networking is Retiring  Heres How
              to Prepare .

          NOTE:
              It can take some time for the status change to be completed.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLE

          o DISABLE

          o USE_LOCAL_RESOURCE_SETTING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

OUTPUT
       ResolverConfig -> (structure)
          An  array that contains settings for the specified Resolver configu-
          ration.

          Id -> (string)
              ID for the Resolver configuration.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPC that you're  con-
              figuring Resolver for.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The owner account ID of the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPC.

          AutodefinedReverse -> (string)
              The  status  of  whether or not the Resolver will create autode-
              fined rules for reverse DNS lookups. This is enabled by default.
              The status can be one of following:

              o ENABLING:  Autodefined rules for reverse DNS lookups are being
                enabled but are not complete.

              o ENABLED: Autodefined rules for reverse  DNS  lookups  are  en-
                abled.

              o DISABLING: Autodefined rules for reverse DNS lookups are being
                disabled but are not complete.

              o DISABLED: Autodefined rules for reverse DNS lookups  are  dis-
                abled.
