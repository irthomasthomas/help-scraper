NAME
       get-firewall-rule-group-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a firewall rule group association, which enables DNS filter-
       ing for a VPC with one rule group. A VPC can have more than  one  fire-
       wall  rule  group  association, and a rule group can be associated with
       more than one VPC.

OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-association-id (string)
          The identifier of the  FirewallRuleGroupAssociation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a firewall rule group association

       The  following  get-firewall-rule-group-association example retrieves a
       firewall rule group association.

          aws route53resolver get-firewall-rule-group-association \
              --firewall-rule-group-association-id rslvr-frgassoc-57e8873d7example

       Output:

                  "FirewallRuleGroupId": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "VpcId": "vpc-31e92222",
                  "Name": "test-association",
                  "Priority": 101,

                  "Status": "COMPLETE",

OUTPUT
       FirewallRuleGroupAssociation -> (structure)
          The association that you requested.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier for the association.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall rule group  asso-
              ciation.

          FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the firewall rule group.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  of  the VPC that is associated with the
              rule group.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the association.

          Priority -> (integer)
              The setting that determines the processing  order  of  the  rule
              group  among  the  rule groups that are associated with a single
              VPC. DNS Firewall filters VPC traffic starting from  rule  group
              with the lowest numeric priority setting.

          MutationProtection -> (string)
              If  enabled,  this  setting disallows modification or removal of
              the association, to help prevent against  accidentally  altering
              DNS firewall protections.

          ManagedOwnerName -> (string)
              The  owner  of  the association, used only for associations that
              are not managed by you. If you use Firewall  Manager  to  manage
              your  DNS  Firewalls,  then this reports Firewall Manager as the
              managed owner.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the association.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Additional information about the  status  of  the  response,  if
              available.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string defined by you to identify the request. This al-
              lows you to retry failed requests without the  risk  of  running
              the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for example,
              a timestamp.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the association was created, in Unix time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time  that the association was last modified, in
              Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
