LIST-FIREWALL-RULES()                                    LIST-FIREWALL-RULES()



NAME
       list-firewall-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  firewall  rules that you have defined for the specified
       firewall rule group. DNS Firewall uses the rules in  a  rule  group  to
       filter DNS network traffic for a VPC.

       A single call might return only a partial list of the rules. For infor-
       mation, see MaxResults .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-firewall-rules is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: FirewallRules

OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of the firewall rule group that you want to
          retrieve the rules for.

       --priority (integer)
          Optional additional filter for the rules to retrieve.

          The setting that determines the processing order of the rules  in  a
          rule  group. DNS Firewall processes the rules in a rule group by or-
          der of priority, starting from the lowest setting.

       --action (string)
          Optional additional filter for the rules to retrieve.

          The action that DNS Firewall should take on  a  DNS  query  when  it
          matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

          o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

          o ALERT  - Permit the request to go through but send an alert to the
            logs.

          o BLOCK - Disallow the request. If  this  is  specified,  additional
            handling details are provided in the rule's BlockResponse setting.

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o BLOCK

          o ALERT

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns  this
          token  in  the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, pro-
          vide this token in your next request.

       FirewallRules -> (list)
          A list of the rules that you have defined.

          This might be a partial list of the firewall rules that  you've  de-
          fined. For information, see MaxResults .

          (structure)
              A single firewall rule in a rule group.

              FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the firewall rule group of the rule.

              FirewallDomainListId -> (string)
                 The ID of the domain list that's used in the rule.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The  priority  of the rule in the rule group. This value must
                 be unique within the rule group. DNS Firewall  processes  the
                 rules in a rule group by order of priority, starting from the
                 lowest setting.

              Action -> (string)
                 The action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query  when
                 it matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

                 o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

                 o ALERT  - Permit the request to go through but send an alert
                   to the logs.

                 o BLOCK - Disallow the request. If this is  specified,  addi-
                   tional handling details are provided in the rule's BlockRe-
                   sponse setting.

              BlockResponse -> (string)
                 The way that you want DNS Firewall to block the request. Used
                 for the rule action setting BLOCK .

                 o NODATA  - Respond indicating that the query was successful,
                   but no response is available for it.

                 o NXDOMAIN - Respond indicating that the domain  name  that's
                   in the query doesn't exist.

                 o OVERRIDE  - Provide a custom override in the response. This
                   option requires  custom  handling  details  in  the  rule's
                   BlockOverride* settings.

              BlockOverrideDomain -> (string)
                 The  custom DNS record to send back in response to the query.
                 Used for the rule action BLOCK with a  BlockResponse  setting
                 of OVERRIDE .

              BlockOverrideDnsType -> (string)
                 The  DNS  record's  type.  This  determines the format of the
                 record value that you provided in BlockOverrideDomain .  Used
                 for  the  rule  action  BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of
                 OVERRIDE .

              BlockOverrideTtl -> (integer)
                 The recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the  DNS  re-
                 solver  or web browser to cache the provided override record.
                 Used for the rule action BLOCK with a  BlockResponse  setting
                 of OVERRIDE .

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A  unique string defined by you to identify the request. This
                 allows you to retry failed requests without the risk of  exe-
                 cuting  the  operation  twice. This can be any unique string,
                 for example, a timestamp.

              CreationTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that the rule was  created,  in  Unix  time
                 format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

              ModificationTime -> (string)
                 The  date  and  time that the rule was last modified, in Unix
                 time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

              FirewallDomainRedirectionAction -> (string)
                 How you want the the rule to evaluate DNS redirection in  the
                 DNS redirection chain, such as CNAME, DNAME, ot ALIAS.
                     Inspect_Redirection_Domain (Default) inspects all domains
                     in the redirection chain. The individual domains  in  the
                     redirection chain must be added to the allow domain list.

                     Trust_Redirection_Domain  inspects  only the first domain
                     in the redirection chain. You don't need to add the  sub-
                     sequent  domains in the domain in the redirection list to
                     the domain alloww list.

              Qtype -> (string)
                 The DNS query type you want the  rule  to  evaluate.  Allowed
                 values are;

                 o A: Returns an IPv4 address.

                 o AAAA: Returns an Ipv6 address.

                   for the domain.

                 o CNAME: Returns another domain name.

                 o DS: Record that identifies the DNSSEC signing key of a del-
                   egated zone.

                 o MX: Specifies mail servers.

                 o NAPTR: Regular-expression-based rewriting of domain names.

                 o NS: Authoritative name servers.

                 o PTR: Maps an IP address to a domain name.

                 o SOA: Start of authority record for the zone.

                 o SPF: Lists the servers authorized to send emails from a do-
                   main.

                 o SRV: Application specific values that identify servers.

                 o TXT: Verifies email senders and  application-specific  val-
                   ues.

                 o A query type you define by using the DNS type ID, for exam-
                   ple 28 for AAAA. The values must be defined as  TYPENUMBER,
                   where  the  NUMBER can be 1-65334, for example, TYPE28. For
                   more information, see List of DNS record types .
