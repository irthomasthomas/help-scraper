OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          A  unique string defined by you to identify the request. This allows
          you to retry failed requests without the risk of running the  opera-
          tion twice. This can be any unique string, for example, a timestamp.

       --name (string)
          A name that lets you identify the rule group, to manage and use it.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  the tag keys and values that you want to associate with
          the rule group.

          (structure)
              One tag that you want to add to the specified  resource.  A  tag
              consists of a Key (a name for the tag) and a Value .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  for the tag. For example, if you want to associate
                 Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for
                 billing purposes, the value of Key might be account-id .

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  for  the tag. For example, if Key is account-id ,
                 then Value might be the  ID  of  the  customer  account  that
                 you're creating the resource for.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a Firewall rule group

       The following create-firewall-rule-group example creates a DNS Firewall
       rule group.

          aws route53resolver create-firewall-rule-group \
              --creator-request-id my-request-id \
              --name test

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRuleGroup": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-rule-group/rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "Name": "test",
                  "RuleCount": 0,
                  "Status": "COMPLETE",
                  "StatusMessage": "Created Firewall Rule Group",
                  "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "my-request-id",
                  "ShareStatus": "NOT_SHARED",
                  "CreationTime": "2021-05-25T18:59:26.490017Z",
                  "ModificationTime": "2021-05-25T18:59:26.490017Z"
              }
          }
