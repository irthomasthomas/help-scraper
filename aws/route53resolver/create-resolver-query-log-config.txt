CREATE-RESOLVER-QUERY-LOG-CONFIG()          CREATE-RESOLVER-QUERY-LOG-CONFIG()



NAME
       create-resolver-query-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Resolver query logging configuration, which defines where you
       want Resolver to save DNS query logs that originate in your  VPCs.  Re-
       solver can log queries only for VPCs that are in the same Region as the
       query logging configuration.

       To specify which VPCs you want to log queries for, you use AssociateRe-
       solverQueryLogConfig      .      For      more     information,     see
       AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig .

       You can optionally use Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share  a  query
       logging  configuration  with  other  Amazon  Web Services accounts. The
       other accounts can then associate  VPCs  with  the  configuration.  The
       query  logs  that  Resolver creates for a configuration include all DNS
       queries that originate in all VPCs that are associated with the config-
       uration.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name that you want to give the query logging configuration.

       --destination-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the resource that you want Resolver to send query logs.
          You can send query logs to an  S3  bucket,  a  CloudWatch  Logs  log
          group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Examples of valid
          values include the following:

          o S3 bucket :   arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket   You can optionally  ap-
            pend  a  file prefix to the end of the ARN.  arn:aws:s3:::example-
            bucket/development/

          o CloudWatch          Logs           log           group           :
            arn:aws:logs:us-west-1:123456789012:log-group:/mystack-test-
            group-12ABC1AB12A1:*

          o Kinesis   Data   Firehose   delivery   stream   :    arn:aws:kine-
            sis:us-east-2:0123456789:stream/my_stream_name

       --creator-request-id (string)
          A  unique  string that identifies the request and that allows failed
          requests to be retried without the risk  of  running  the  operation
          twice.  CreatorRequestId  can  be  any unique string, for example, a
          date/time stamp.

       --tags (list)
          A list of the tag keys and values that you want  to  associate  with
          the query logging configuration.

          (structure)
              One  tag  that  you want to add to the specified resource. A tag
              consists of a Key (a name for the tag) and a Value .

              Key -> (string)
                 The name for the tag. For example, if you want  to  associate
                 Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for
                 billing purposes, the value of Key might be account-id .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the tag. For example, if Key  is  account-id  ,
                 then  Value  might  be  the  ID  of the customer account that
                 you're creating the resource for.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResolverQueryLogConfig -> (structure)

          ing the status of the request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID for the query logging configuration.

          OwnerId -> (string)

              values include the following:

              o CREATING : Resolver is creating the query  logging  configura-
                tion.

              o DELETING  : Resolver is deleting this query logging configura-
                tion.

          DestinationArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the  resource that you want Resolver to send query
              logs: an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch Logs log group, or a Ki-

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A  unique  string  that  identifies the request that created the
              query logging configuration. The CreatorRequestId allows  failed

              twice.

          CreationTime -> (string)
