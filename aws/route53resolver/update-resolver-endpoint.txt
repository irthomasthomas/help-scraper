OPTIONS
       --resolver-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver endpoint that you want to update.

       --name (string)
          The name of the Resolver endpoint that you want to update.

       --resolver-endpoint-type (string)
          Specifies the endpoint type for what type of IP address the endpoint
          uses to forward DNS queries.

          Updating to IPV6 type isn't currently supported.

          Possible values:

          o IPV6

          o IPV4

          o DUALSTACK

       --update-ip-addresses (list)
          Specifies the IPv6 address when you  update  the  Resolver  endpoint
          from  IPv4  to dual-stack. If you don't specify an IPv6 address, one
          will be automatically chosen from your subnet.

          (structure)
              Provides information about the IP address type  in  response  to
              UpdateResolverEndpoint .

              IpId -> (string)
                 The ID of the IP address, specified by the ResolverEndpointId
                 .

              Ipv6 -> (string)
                 The IPv6 address that you want to use for DNS queries.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IpId=string,Ipv6=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "IpId": "string",
              "Ipv6": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --protocols (list)
          The protocols you want to use for the endpoint. DoH-FIPS is applica-
          ble for inbound endpoints only.

          For an inbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

          o Do53 and DoH in combination.

          o Do53 and DoH-FIPS in combination.

          o Do53 alone.

          o DoH alone.

          o DoH-FIPS alone.

          o None, which is treated as Do53.

          For an outbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

          o Do53 and DoH in combination.

          o Do53 alone.

          o DoH alone.

          o None, which is treated as Do53.

          WARNING:
              You  can't  change  the protocol of an inbound endpoint directly
              from only Do53 to only DoH, or DoH-FIPS. This is  to  prevent  a
              sudden  disruption  to  incoming traffic that relies on Do53. To
              change the protocol from Do53 to  DoH,  or  DoH-FIPS,  you  must
              first  enable  both  Do53 and DoH, or Do53 and DoH-FIPS, to make
              sure that all incoming traffic has transferred to using the  DoH
              protocol, or DoH-FIPS, and then remove the Do53.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            DoH
            Do53
            DoH-FIPS

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update the name of a Resolver endpoint

       The  following  update-resolver-endpoint  example updates the name of a
       Resolver endpoint. Updating other values isn't supported.

          aws route53resolver update-resolver-endpoint \
              --resolver-endpoint-id rslvr-in-b5d45e32bdc445f09 \
              --name my-renamed-inbound-endpoint

       Output:

          {
              "ResolverEndpoint": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-in-b5d45e32bdexample",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "2020-01-02-18:48",

OUTPUT
       ResolverEndpoint -> (structure)
          The response to an UpdateResolverEndpoint request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the Resolver endpoint.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that identifies the request that created the Re-
              solver  endpoint. The CreatorRequestId allows failed requests to
              be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver endpoint.

          Name -> (string)
              The name that you assigned to the  Resolver  endpoint  when  you
              submitted a CreateResolverEndpoint request.

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The  ID  of  one  or more security groups that control access to
              this VPC. The security group must include one  or  more  inbound
              rules  (for  inbound  endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound
              endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow  TCP  and  UDP
              access.  For  inbound access, open port 53. For outbound access,
              open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your network.

              (string)

          Direction -> (string)
              Indicates whether the Resolver endpoint allows inbound  or  out-
              bound DNS queries:

              o INBOUND : allows DNS queries to your VPC from your network

              o OUTBOUND : allows DNS queries from your VPC to your network

          IpAddressCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  IP addresses that the Resolver endpoint can use
              for DNS queries.

          HostVPCId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC that you want to create the Resolver  endpoint
              in.

          Status -> (string)
              A  code  that  specifies the current status of the Resolver end-
              point. Valid values include the following:

              o CREATING : Resolver is creating and configuring  one  or  more
                Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.

              o OPERATIONAL  : The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this end-
                point are correctly configured and able  to  pass  inbound  or
                outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.

              o UPDATING  :  Resolver  is associating or disassociating one or
                more network interfaces with this endpoint.

              o AUTO_RECOVERING : Resolver is trying to recover one or more of
                the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint.
                During the recovery process, the endpoint functions with  lim-
                ited  capacity  because  of  the  limit  on  the number of DNS
                queries per IP address (per network interface). For  the  cur-
                rent limit, see Limits on Route 53 Resolver .

              o ACTION_NEEDED : This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can't
                automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend
                that  you  check  each IP address that you associated with the
                endpoint. For each IP address that isn't  available,  add  an-
                other  IP  address  and  then delete the IP address that isn't
                available. (An endpoint must always include at  least  two  IP
                addresses.)  A  status  of ACTION_NEEDED can have a variety of
                causes. Here are two common causes:

                o One or more of the network interfaces  that  are  associated
                  with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.

                o The  network  interface  couldn't be created for some reason
                  that's outside the control of Resolver.

              o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the  associ-
                ated network interfaces.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of the Resolver endpoint.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time that the endpoint was created, in Unix time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the endpoint was last modified,  in  Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          OutpostArn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Outpost.

          PreferredInstanceType -> (string)
              The Amazon EC2 instance type.

          ResolverEndpointType -> (string)
              The Resolver endpoint IP address type.

          Protocols -> (list)
              Protocols  used for the endpoint. DoH-FIPS is applicable for in-
              bound endpoints only.

              For an inbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

              o Do53 and DoH in combination.

              o Do53 and DoH-FIPS in combination.

              o Do53 alone.

              o DoH alone.

              o DoH-FIPS alone.

              o None, which is treated as Do53.

              For an outbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

              o Do53 and DoH in combination.

              o Do53 alone.

              o DoH alone.

              o None, which is treated as Do53.

              (string)
