NAME
       disassociate-resolver-query-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates a VPC from a query logging configuration.

       NOTE:
          Before  you can delete a query logging configuration, you must first
          disassociate all VPCs from the configuration. If you  used  Resource
          Access  Manager  (RAM)  to  share a query logging configuration with
          other accounts, VPCs can be disassociated from the configuration  in
          the following ways:

          o The accounts that you shared the configuration with can disassoci-
            ate VPCs from the configuration.

          o You can stop sharing the configuration.

OPTIONS
       --resolver-query-log-config-id (string)
          The ID of the query logging configuration that you want to  disasso-
          ciate a specified VPC from.

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon VPC that you want to disassociate from a speci-
          fied query logging configuration.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociation -> (structure)
          A  complex  type that contains settings for the association that you
          deleted between an Amazon VPC and a query logging configuration.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the query logging association.

          ResolverQueryLogConfigId -> (string)
              The ID of the query logging configuration that a VPC is  associ-
              ated with.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              The  ID of the Amazon VPC that is associated with the query log-
              ging configuration.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the specified  query  logging  association.  Valid
              values include the following:

              o CREATING : Resolver is creating an association between an Ama-
                zon VPC and a query logging configuration.

              o CREATED : The association between an Amazon VPC  and  a  query
                logging  configuration  was  successfully created. Resolver is
                logging queries that originate in the specified VPC.

              o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this  query  logging  associa-
                tion.

              o FAILED  :  Resolver  either couldn't create or couldn't delete
                the query logging association.

          Error -> (string)
              If the value of Status is FAILED , the value of Error  indicates
              the cause:

              o DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND  :  The specified destination (for exam-
                ple, an Amazon S3 bucket) was deleted.

              o ACCESS_DENIED : Permissions don't allow sending  logs  to  the
                destination.

              Contains additional information about the error. If the value or
              Error is null, the value of ErrorMessage also is null.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time  that the VPC was associated with the query
              logging configuration, in Unix time format and Coordinated  Uni-
              versal Time (UTC).
