OPTIONS
       --resolver-query-log-config-id (string)
          The  ID of the Resolver query logging configuration that you want to
          get information about.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResolverQueryLogConfig -> (structure)
          Information about the Resolver query logging configuration that  you
          specified in a GetQueryLogConfig request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID for the query logging configuration.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The  Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that created
              the query logging configuration.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the specified query logging  configuration.  Valid
              values include the following:

              o CREATING  :  Resolver is creating the query logging configura-
                tion.

              o CREATED : The query  logging  configuration  was  successfully
                created.  Resolver  is  logging  queries that originate in the
                specified VPC.

              o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this query logging  configura-
                tion.

              o FAILED  :  Resolver can't deliver logs to the location that is
                specified in the query logging  configuration.  Here  are  two
                common causes:

                o The specified destination (for example, an Amazon S3 bucket)
                  was deleted.

                o Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.

          ShareStatus -> (string)
              An indication of whether  the  query  logging  configuration  is
              shared  with  other  Amazon Web Services accounts, or was shared
              with the current account by another Amazon Web Services account.
              Sharing is configured through Resource Access Manager (RAM).

          AssociationCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  VPCs that are associated with the query logging
              configuration.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN for the query logging configuration.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the query logging configuration.

          DestinationArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the resource that you want  Resolver  to  send  query
              logs: an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch Logs log group, or a Ki-
              nesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that identifies the  request  that  created  the
              query  logging configuration. The CreatorRequestId allows failed
              requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation
              twice.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date and time that the query logging configuration was cre-
              ated, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
