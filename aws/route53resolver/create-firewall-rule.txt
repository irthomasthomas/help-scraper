OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request and that allows  you  to
          retry  failed  requests  without  the  risk of running the operation
          twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique  string,  for  example,  a
          date/time stamp.

       --firewall-rule-group-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier of the firewall rule group where you want to
          create the rule.

       --firewall-domain-list-id (string)
          The ID of the domain list that you want to use in the rule.

       --priority (integer)
          The setting that determines the processing order of the rule in  the
          rule  group. DNS Firewall processes the rules in a rule group by or-
          der of priority, starting from the lowest setting.

          You must specify a unique priority for each rule in a rule group. To
          make  it  easier to insert rules later, leave space between the num-
          bers, for example, use 100, 200, and so on. You can change the  pri-
          ority setting for the rules in a rule group at any time.

       --action (string)
          The  action  that  DNS  Firewall  should take on a DNS query when it
          matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

          o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

          o ALERT - Permit the request and send  metrics  and  logs  to  Cloud
            Watch.

          o BLOCK  - Disallow the request. This option requires additional de-
            tails in the rule's BlockResponse .

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o BLOCK

          o ALERT

       --block-response (string)
          The way that you want DNS Firewall to block the request,  used  with
          the rule action setting BLOCK .

          o NODATA  - Respond indicating that the query was successful, but no
            response is available for it.

          o NXDOMAIN - Respond indicating that the domain name that's  in  the
            query doesn't exist.

          o OVERRIDE  - Provide a custom override in the response. This option
            requires custom handling details in the rule's BlockOverride* set-
            tings.

          This setting is required if the rule action setting is BLOCK .

          Possible values:

          o NODATA

          o NXDOMAIN

          o OVERRIDE

       --block-override-domain (string)
          The  custom  DNS  record to send back in response to the query. Used
          for the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          This setting is required if the BlockResponse setting is OVERRIDE .

       --block-override-dns-type (string)
          The DNS record's type. This determines  the  format  of  the  record
          value  that  you provided in BlockOverrideDomain . Used for the rule
          action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          This setting is required if the BlockResponse setting is OVERRIDE .

          Possible values:

          o CNAME

       --block-override-ttl (integer)
          The recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver  or
          web browser to cache the provided override record. Used for the rule
          action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          This setting is required if the BlockResponse setting is OVERRIDE .

       --name (string)
          A name that lets you identify the rule in the rule group.

       --firewall-domain-redirection-action (string)
          How you want the the rule to evaluate DNS redirection in the DNS re-
          direction chain, such as CNAME or DNAME.
              Inspect_Redirection_Domain (Default) inspects all domains in the
              redirection chain. The individual  domains  in  the  redirection
              chain must be added to the domain list.

              Trust_Redirection_Domain  inspects  only the first domain in the
              redirection chain. You don't need to add the subsequent  domains
              in the domain in the redirection list to the domain list.

          Possible values:

          o SRV: Application specific values that identify servers.

          o TXT: Verifies email senders and application-specific values.

          o A query type you define by using the DNS type ID, for  example  28
            for AAAA. The values must be defined as TYPENUMBER, where the NUM-
            BER can be 1-65334, for example, TYPE28. For more information, see
            List of DNS record types .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a firewall rule

       The following create-firewall-rule example creates a firewall rule in a
       DNS Firewall rule for domains listed in a DNS Firewall domain list.

          aws route53resolver create-firewall-rule \
              --name allow-rule \
              --firewall-rule-group-id rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample \
              --firewall-domain-list-id rslvr-fdl-9e956e9ffexample \
              --priority 101 \
              --action ALLOW

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRule": {
                  "FirewallRuleGroupId": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "FirewallDomainListId": "rslvr-fdl-9e956e9ffexample",
                  "Name": "allow-rule",
                  "Priority": 101,
                  "Action": "ALLOW",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "d81e3fb7-020b-415e-939f-EXAMPLE11111",

              The  priority  of the rule in the rule group. This value must be
              unique within the rule group. DNS Firewall processes  the  rules
              in  a  rule group by order of priority, starting from the lowest
              setting.

          Action -> (string)
              The action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query when  it
              matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

              o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

              o ALERT  - Permit the request to go through but send an alert to
                the logs.

              o BLOCK - Disallow the request. If this is specified, additional
                handling details are provided in the rule's BlockResponse set-
                ting.

          BlockResponse -> (string)
              The way that you want DNS Firewall to block  the  request.  Used
              for the rule action setting BLOCK .

                no response is available for it.

              o NXDOMAIN - Respond indicating that the domain name  that's  in
                the query doesn't exist.

              o OVERRIDE - Provide a custom override in the response. This op-
                tion requires custom handling details in the rule's BlockOver-
                ride* settings.

          BlockOverrideDomain -> (string)
              The  custom  DNS  record  to send back in response to the query.
              Used for the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse  setting  of

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string defined by you to identify the request. This al-
              lows you to retry failed requests without the risk of  executing
              the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for example,
              a timestamp.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the rule was created, in Unix time format
              and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)

                 list.

          Qtype -> (string)
              The DNS query type you want the rule to evaluate. Allowed values
              are;

              o A: Returns an IPv4 address.

              o AAAA: Returns an Ipv6 address.
