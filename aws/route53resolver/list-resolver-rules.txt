LIST-RESOLVER-RULES()                                    LIST-RESOLVER-RULES()



NAME
       list-resolver-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the Resolver rules that were created using the current Amazon Web
       Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-resolver-rules is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ResolverRules

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An optional specification to return a subset of Resolver rules, such
          as all Resolver rules that are associated  with  the  same  Resolver
          endpoint.

          NOTE:
              If  you  submit a second or subsequent ListResolverRules request
              and specify the NextToken parameter, you must use the same  val-
              ues for Filters , if any, as in the previous request.

          (structure)
              For    Resolver   list   operations   (ListResolverEndpoints   ,
              ListResolverRules     ,      ListResolverRuleAssociations      ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                                    ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations          ),           and
              ListResolverDnssecConfigs ), an optional specification to return
              a subset of objects.

              To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules,
              you  specify Name and Values . For example, to list only inbound
              Resolver endpoints, specify Direction for Name and  specify  IN-
              BOUND for Values .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the parameter that you want to use to filter ob-
                 jects.

                 The valid values for Name depend on the  action  that  you're
                 including    the    filter    in,   ListResolverEndpoints   ,
                 ListResolverRules    ,     ListResolverRuleAssociations     ,
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                ,               or
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations .

                 NOTE:
                        In early versions of Resolver, values  for  Name  were
                        listed  as  uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters.
                        For example, CreatorRequestId was originally listed as
                        CREATOR_REQUEST_ID  .  Uppercase  values  for Name are
                        still supported.

                     ListResolverEndpoints

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId : The value that you  specified  when  you
                   created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Direction  : Whether you want to return inbound or outbound
                   Resolver endpoints. If you specify  DIRECTION  for  Name  ,
                   specify INBOUND or OUTBOUND for Values .

                 o HostVPCId : The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass
                   through on the way from your network to your VPCs in a  re-
                   gion,  or the VPC that outbound queries pass through on the
                   way   from   your   VPCs   to   your    network.    In    a
                   CreateResolverEndpoint request, SubnetId indirectly identi-
                   fies the VPC. In a GetResolverEndpoint request, the VPC  ID
                   for  a  Resolver endpoint is returned in the HostVPCId ele-
                   ment.

                 o IpAddressCount : The number of IP addresses that  you  have
                   associated with the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Name : The name of the Resolver endpoint.

                 o SecurityGroupIds  : The IDs of the VPC security groups that
                   you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Status : The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you  spec-
                   ify  Status  for Name , specify one of the following status
                   codes for Values : CREATING  ,  OPERATIONAL  ,  UPDATING  ,
                   AUTO_RECOVERING  ,  ACTION_NEEDED  , or DELETING . For more
                   information, see Status in ResolverEndpoint .
                     ListResolverRules

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId : The value that you  specified  when  you
                   created the Resolver rule.

                 o DomainName : The domain name for which Resolver is forward-
                   ing DNS queries to your network.  In  the  value  that  you
                   specify  for  Values , include a trailing dot (.) after the
                   domain name. For example,  if  the  domain  name  is  exam-
                   ple.com,  specify  the  following value. Note the "." after
                   com :  example.com.

                 o ResolverEndpointId : The ID of the Resolver  endpoint  that
                   the Resolver rule is associated with.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can  filter  on the Resolver endpoint only for rules
                     that have a value of FORWARD for RuleType .

                 o Status : The status of the Resolver rule.  If  you  specify
                   Status for Name , specify one of the following status codes
                   for Values : COMPLETE , DELETING , UPDATING , or FAILED .

                 o Type : The type of the Resolver rule. If you  specify  TYPE
                   for Name , specify FORWARD or SYSTEM for Values .

              Values -> (list)
                 When you're using a List operation and you want the operation
                 to return a subset of objects, such as Resolver endpoints  or
                 Resolver  rules,  the value of the parameter that you want to
                 use to filter objects. For example, to list only inbound  Re-
                 solver  endpoints, specify Direction for Name and specify IN-
                 BOUND for Values .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list Resolver rules

       The following list-resolver-rules example lists all the Resolver  rules
       in the current AWS account.

          If more than MaxResults Resolver rules match the specified criteria,
          you  can  submit  another  ListResolverRules request to get the next
          group of results. In the next request, specify the value of  NextTo-
          ken from the previous response.

       MaxResults -> (integer)
          The value that you specified for MaxResults in the request.

       ResolverRules -> (list)
          The  Resolver  rules  that were created using the current Amazon Web
          Services account and that match the specified filters, if any.

          (structure)
              For queries that originate in  your  VPC,  detailed  information
              about  a Resolver rule, which specifies how to route DNS queries
              out of the VPC. The ResolverRule parameter appears  in  the  re-
              sponse   to   a   CreateResolverRule   ,   DeleteResolverRule  ,
              GetResolverRule , ListResolverRules , or UpdateResolverRule  re-
              quest.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  ID  that Resolver assigned to the Resolver rule when you
                 created it.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A unique string that you specified when you created  the  Re-
                 solver  rule. CreatorRequestId identifies the request and al-
                 lows failed requests to be retried without the risk  of  run-
                 ning the operation twice.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver rule speci-
                 fied by Id .

              DomainName -> (string)
                 DNS queries for this domain name are forwarded to the IP  ad-
                 dresses  that are specified in TargetIps . If a query matches
                 multiple Resolver rules  (example.com  and  www.example.com),
                 the query is routed using the Resolver rule that contains the
                 most specific domain name (www.example.com).

              Status -> (string)
                 A code that specifies the  current  status  of  the  Resolver
                 rule.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 A detailed description of the status of a Resolver rule.

              RuleType -> (string)
                 When  you  want  to  forward DNS queries for specified domain
                 name to resolvers on your network, specify FORWARD .

                 When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for  a
                 domain  to  your  network  and  you  want Resolver to process
                 queries for a subdomain of that domain, specify SYSTEM .

                 For example, to forward DNS queries for  example.com  to  re-
                 solvers  on  your network, you create a rule and specify FOR-
                 WARD for RuleType . To then have Resolver process queries for
                 apex.example.com,  you  create  a rule and specify SYSTEM for
                 RuleType .

                 Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have  a  value
                 of RECURSIVE for RuleType .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name for the Resolver rule, which you specified when you
                 created the Resolver rule.

              TargetIps -> (list)
                 An array that contains the IP addresses  and  ports  that  an
                 outbound  endpoint  forwards DNS queries to. Typically, these
                 are the IP addresses of DNS resolvers on your network.

                 (structure)
                     In a CreateResolverRule request, an array of the IPs that
                     you want to forward DNS queries to.

                     Ip -> (string)
                        One  IPv4 address that you want to forward DNS queries
                        to.

                     Port -> (integer)
                        The port at Ip that you want to  forward  DNS  queries
                        to.

                     Ipv6 -> (string)
                        One  IPv6 address that you want to forward DNS queries
                        to.

                     Protocol -> (string)
                        The protocols for the Resolver endpoints. DoH-FIPS  is
                        applicable for inbound endpoints only.

                        For an inbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as
                        follows:

                        o Do53 and DoH in combination.

                        o Do53 and DoH-FIPS in combination.

                        o Do53 alone.

                        o DoH alone.

                        o DoH-FIPS alone.

                        o None, which is treated as Do53.

                        For an outbound endpoint you can apply  the  protocols
                        as follows:

                        o Do53 and DoH in combination.

                        o Do53 alone.

                        o DoH alone.

                        o None, which is treated as Do53.

                     ServerNameIndication -> (string)
                        The  Server Name Indication of the DoH server that you
                        want to forward queries to. This is only used  if  the
                        Protocol of the TargetAddress is DoH .

              ResolverEndpointId -> (string)
                 The ID of the endpoint that the rule is associated with.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 When  a  rule  is shared with another Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count, the account ID of the account that the rule is  shared
                 with.

              ShareStatus -> (string)
                 Whether  the  rule  is shared and, if so, whether the current
                 account is sharing the rule with another account, or  another
                 account is sharing the rule with the current account.

              CreationTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that the Resolver rule was created, in Unix
                 time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
