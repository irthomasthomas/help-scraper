OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule that you  want  to  share
          with another account.

       --resolver-rule-policy (string)
          An  Identity  and  Access Management policy statement that lists the
          rules that you want to share with another Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
          count  and  the  operations  that you want the account to be able to
          perform. You can specify the following operations in the Action sec-
          tion of the statement:

          o route53resolver:GetResolverRule

          o route53resolver:AssociateResolverRule

          o route53resolver:DisassociateResolverRule

          o route53resolver:ListResolverRules

          o route53resolver:ListResolverRuleAssociations

          In  the  Resource  section of the statement, specify the ARN for the
          rule that you want to share with another account. Specify  the  same
          ARN that you specified in Arn .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To share a Resolver rule with another AWS account

       The  following  put-resolver-rule-policy  example  specifies a Resolver
       rule that you want to share with another AWS account, the account  that
       you  want  to share the rule with, and the rule-related operations that
       you want the account to be able to perform on the rules.

       Note You must run this command using credentials from the same  account
       that created the rule.

          aws route53resolver put-resolver-rule-policy \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --arn "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-east-1:111122223333:resolver-rule/rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example" \
              --resolver-rule-policy "{\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \
                  \"Statement\": [ { \
                  \"Effect\" : \"Allow\", \
                  \"Principal\" : {\"AWS\" : \"444455556666\" }, \
                  \"Action\" : [ \
                      \"route53resolver:GetResolverRule\", \
                      \"route53resolver:AssociateResolverRule\", \
                      \"route53resolver:DisassociateResolverRule\", \
                      \"route53resolver:ListResolverRules\", \
                      \"route53resolver:ListResolverRuleAssociations\" ], \
                  \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:route53resolver:us-east-1:111122223333:resolver-rule/rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example\" ] } ] }"

       Output:

          {
              "ReturnValue": true
          }

       After  you  run put-resolver-rule-policy, you can run the following two
       Resource Access Manager (RAM) commands. You must use the  account  that
       you want to share the rule with:

       o get-resource-share-invitations returns the value resourceShareInvita-
         tionArn. You need this value to accept  the  invitation  to  use  the
         shared rule.

       o accept-resource-share-invitation  accepts  the  invitation to use the
         shared rule.

       For more information, see the following documentation:

       o get-resource-share-invitations

       o accept-resource-share-invitations

       o Sharing Forwarding Rules with Other AWS  Accounts  and  Using  Shared
         Rules in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide

OUTPUT
       ReturnValue -> (boolean)
          Whether the PutResolverRulePolicy request was successful.
