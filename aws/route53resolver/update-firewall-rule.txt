OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the firewall rule group for the rule.

       --firewall-domain-list-id (string)
          The ID of the domain list to use in the rule.

       --priority (integer)
          The  setting that determines the processing order of the rule in the
          rule group. DNS Firewall processes the rules in a rule group by  or-
          der of priority, starting from the lowest setting.

          You must specify a unique priority for each rule in a rule group. To
          make it easier to insert rules later, leave space between  the  num-
          bers,  for example, use 100, 200, and so on. You can change the pri-
          ority setting for the rules in a rule group at any time.

       --action (string)
          The action that DNS Firewall should take on  a  DNS  query  when  it
          matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

          o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

          o ALERT  - Permit the request to go through but send an alert to the
            logs.

          o BLOCK - Disallow the request. This option requires additional  de-
            tails in the rule's BlockResponse .

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o BLOCK

          o ALERT

       --block-response (string)
          The  way  that  you want DNS Firewall to block the request. Used for
          the rule action setting BLOCK .

          o NODATA - Respond indicating that the query was successful, but  no
            response is available for it.

          o NXDOMAIN  -  Respond indicating that the domain name that's in the
            query doesn't exist.

          o OVERRIDE - Provide a custom override in the response. This  option
            requires custom handling details in the rule's BlockOverride* set-
            tings.

          Possible values:

          o NODATA

          o NXDOMAIN

          o OVERRIDE

       --block-override-domain (string)
          The custom DNS record to send back in response to  the  query.  Used
          for the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

       --block-override-dns-type (string)
          The  DNS  record's  type.  This  determines the format of the record
          value that you provided in BlockOverrideDomain . Used for  the  rule
          action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          Possible values:

          o CNAME

       --block-override-ttl (integer)
          The  recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver or
          web browser to cache the provided override record. Used for the rule
          action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

       --name (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --qtype (string)
          The  DNS  query  type  you want the rule to evaluate. Allowed values
          are;

          o A: Returns an IPv4 address.

          o AAAA: Returns an Ipv6 address.

          o CAA: Restricts CAs that can create SSL/TLS certifications for  the
            domain.

          o CNAME: Returns another domain name.

          o DS:  Record  that identifies the DNSSEC signing key of a delegated
            zone.

          o MX: Specifies mail servers.

          o NAPTR: Regular-expression-based rewriting of domain names.

          o NS: Authoritative name servers.

          o PTR: Maps an IP address to a domain name.

          o SOA: Start of authority record for the zone.

          o SPF: Lists the servers authorized to send emails from a domain.

          o SRV: Application specific values that identify servers.

          o TXT: Verifies email senders and application-specific values.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a firewall rule

       The following update-firewall-rule example updates a firewall rule with
       the parameters you specify.

          aws route53resolver update-firewall-rule \
              --firewall-rule-group-id rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample \
              --firewall-domain-list-id rslvr-fdl-9e956e9ffexample \
              --priority 102

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRule": {
                  "FirewallRuleGroupId": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",

OUTPUT
       FirewallRule -> (structure)
          The firewall rule that you just updated.

          FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the firewall rule group of the rule.

              The priority of the rule in the rule group. This value  must  be
              unique  within  the rule group. DNS Firewall processes the rules
              in a rule group by order of priority, starting from  the  lowest
              setting.

          Action -> (string)
              The  action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query when it
              matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

              o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

              o ALERT - Permit the request to go through but send an alert  to
                the logs.

              o BLOCK - Disallow the request. If this is specified, additional
                handling details are provided in the rule's BlockResponse set-
                ting.

          BlockResponse -> (string)
              The  way  that  you want DNS Firewall to block the request. Used
              for the rule action setting BLOCK .

              o NODATA - Respond indicating that the query was successful, but
                no response is available for it.

              o NXDOMAIN  -  Respond indicating that the domain name that's in
                the query doesn't exist.

              o OVERRIDE - Provide a custom override in the response. This op-
                tion requires custom handling details in the rule's BlockOver-
                ride* settings.

          BlockOverrideDomain -> (string)
              The custom DNS record to send back in  response  to  the  query.

          BlockOverrideDnsType -> (string)
              The DNS record's type. This determines the format of the  record
              value  that  you  provided in BlockOverrideDomain . Used for the
              rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          BlockOverrideTtl -> (integer)
              The recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver
              or  web  browser to cache the provided override record. Used for

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string defined by you to identify the request. This al-
              lows  you to retry failed requests without the risk of executing
              the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for example,
              a timestamp.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the rule was created, in Unix time format
              and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
