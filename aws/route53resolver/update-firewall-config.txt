NAME
       update-firewall-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  configuration  of  the  firewall behavior provided by DNS
       Firewall for a single VPC from Amazon  Virtual  Private  Cloud  (Amazon
       VPC).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

SYNOPSIS
            update-firewall-config
          --resource-id <value>
          --firewall-fail-open <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC that the configuration is for.

       --firewall-fail-open (string)
          Determines  how  Route  53 Resolver handles queries during failures,
          for example when all traffic that is sent to DNS Firewall  fails  to
          receive a reply.

          o By default, fail open is disabled, which means the failure mode is
            closed. This approach favors security over availability. DNS Fire-
            wall blocks queries that it is unable to evaluate properly.

          o If you enable this option, the failure mode is open. This approach
            favors availability over security. DNS Firewall allows queries  to
            proceed if it is unable to properly evaluate them.

          This  behavior  is only enforced for VPCs that have at least one DNS
          Firewall rule group association.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a firewall config

       The following update-firewall-config example updates DNS Firewall  con-
       figuration.

          aws route53resolver update-firewall-config \
              --resource-id vpc-31e92222 \
              --firewall-fail-open DISABLED

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallConfig": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-fc-86016850cexample",
                  "ResourceId": "vpc-31e92222",
                  "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                  "FirewallFailOpen": "DISABLED"
              }
          }

       For  more information, see DNS Firewall VPC configuration in the Amazon
       Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       FirewallConfig -> (structure)
          Configuration of the firewall behavior provided by DNS Firewall  for
          a single VPC.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the firewall configuration.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC that this firewall configuration applies to.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The  Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner of the VPC that
              this firewall configuration applies to.

          FirewallFailOpen -> (string)
              Determines how DNS Firewall operates during failures, for  exam-
              ple  when  all traffic that is sent to DNS Firewall fails to re-
              ceive a reply.

              o By default, fail open is disabled,  which  means  the  failure
                mode  is closed. This approach favors security over availabil-
                ity. DNS Firewall returns a failure error when it is unable to
                properly evaluate a query.

              o If  you enable this option, the failure mode is open. This ap-
                proach favors availability over security. DNS Firewall  allows
                queries to proceed if it is unable to properly evaluate them.

              This  behavior  is only enforced for VPCs that have at least one
              DNS Firewall rule group association.
