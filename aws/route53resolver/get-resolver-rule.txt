          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-rule-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver rule that you want to get information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a Resolver rule

       The  following  get-resolver-rule  example  displays  details about the
       specified Resolver rule, such as the domain name that the rule forwards
       DNS  queries  for and the ID of the outbound resolver endpoint that the
       rule is associated with.

          aws route53resolver get-resolver-rule \
              --resolver-rule-id rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example

       Output:

OUTPUT
       ResolverRule -> (structure)
          Information  about  the Resolver rule that you specified in a GetRe-
          solverRule request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Resolver assigned to the Resolver rule when you cre-
              ated it.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that you specified when you created the Resolver
              rule. CreatorRequestId identifies the request and allows  failed
              requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation
              twice.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver  rule  specified
              by Id .

          DomainName -> (string)
              DNS  queries  for  this  domain name are forwarded to the IP ad-
              dresses that are specified in TargetIps .  If  a  query  matches
              multiple  Resolver  rules (example.com and www.example.com), the
              query is routed using the Resolver rule that contains  the  most
              specific domain name (www.example.com).

          Status -> (string)
              A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver rule.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of a Resolver rule.

          RuleType -> (string)
              When  you  want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name
              to resolvers on your network, specify FORWARD .

              When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a do-
              main  to  your  network and you want Resolver to process queries
              for a subdomain of that domain, specify SYSTEM .

              For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers
              on your network, you create a rule and specify FORWARD for Rule-
              Type . To then have  Resolver  process  queries  for  apex.exam-
              ple.com, you create a rule and specify SYSTEM for RuleType .

              Currently,  only  Resolver can create rules that have a value of
              RECURSIVE for RuleType .

          Name -> (string)
              The name for the Resolver rule, which  you  specified  when  you
              created the Resolver rule.

          TargetIps -> (list)
              An  array  that contains the IP addresses and ports that an out-
              bound endpoint forwards DNS queries to. Typically, these are the
              IP addresses of DNS resolvers on your network.

              (structure)
                 In a CreateResolverRule request, an array of the IPs that you
                 want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Ip -> (string)
                     One IPv4 address that you want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port at Ip that you want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Ipv6 -> (string)
                     One IPv6 address that you want to forward DNS queries to.

          ResolverEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the endpoint that the rule is associated with.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              When a rule is shared with another Amazon Web Services  account,
              the account ID of the account that the rule is shared with.

          ShareStatus -> (string)
              Whether  the  rule is shared and, if so, whether the current ac-
              count is sharing the rule with another account, or  another  ac-
              count is sharing the rule with the current account.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time that the Resolver rule was created, in Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the Resolver rule was  last  updated,  in
              Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
