NAME
       list-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists queues.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-queues  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: queues

OPTIONS
       --farm-id (string)
          The farm ID of the queue.

       --principal-id (string)
          The principal IDs to include in the list of queues.

       --status (string)
          The status of the queues listed.

          o ACTIVE The queues are active.

          o SCHEDULING The queues are scheduling.

          o SCHEDULING_BLOCKED The  queue  scheduling  is  blocked  for  these
            queues.

          Possible values:

          o IDLE

          o SCHEDULING

          o SCHEDULING_BLOCKED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 The display name of the queue summary to update.

                 WARNING:
                     This  field  can store any content. Escape or encode this
                     content before displaying it on a webpage  or  any  other
                     system that might interpret the content of this field.

              status -> (string)
                 That status of the queue.

              defaultBudgetAction -> (string)
                 The  default  action  taken  on  a  queue summary if a budget
                 wasn't configured.

              blockedReason -> (string)
                 The reason the queue is blocked, if applicable.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the resource was created.

              createdBy -> (string)
                 The user or system that created this resource.

              updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the resource was updated.

              updatedBy -> (string)
                 The user or system that updated this resource.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If Deadline Cloud returns nextToken , then there  are  more  results
          available.  The  value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for
          each page. To retrieve the next page, call the operation again using
          the  returned  token.  Keep all other arguments unchanged. If no re-
          sults remain, then nextToken is set to null . Each pagination  token
          expires  after  24  hours.  If you provide a token that isn't valid,
          then you receive an HTTP 400 ValidationException error.
