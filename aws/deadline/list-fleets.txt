LIST-FLEETS()                                                    LIST-FLEETS()



NAME
       list-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists fleets.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-fleets  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: fleets

OPTIONS
       --farm-id (string)
          The farm ID of the fleets.

       --principal-id (string)
          The principal ID of the members to include in the fleet.

       --display-name (string)
          The display names of a list of fleets.

          WARNING:
              This field can store any content. Escape or encode this  content
              before displaying it on a webpage or any other system that might
              interpret the content of this field.

       --status (string)
          The status of the fleet.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS

          o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS

          o CREATE_FAILED

          o UPDATE_FAILED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  Deadline  Cloud  returns nextToken , then there are more results
          available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagination  token  for
          each page. To retrieve the next page, call the operation again using
          the returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.  If  no  re-
          sults  remain, then nextToken is set to null . Each pagination token
          expires after 24 hours. If you provide a  token  that  isn't  valid,
          then you receive an HTTP 400 ValidationException error.
