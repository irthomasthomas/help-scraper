LIST-MONITORS()                                                LIST-MONITORS()



NAME
       list-monitors -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of your monitors in Deadline Cloud.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-monitors  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: monitors

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT

          Deadline Cloud.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a monitor in Deadline Cloud.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  UNIX timestamp of the date and time that the monitor was

              identityCenterApplicationArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that the IAM Identity Center
                 assigned to the monitor when it was created.

              identityCenterInstanceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM Identity Center in-
                 stance responsible for authenticating monitor users.

                 tor. Users of the monitor use this role  to  access  Deadline
                 Cloud resources.

              subdomain -> (string)
                 The  subdomain  used for the monitor URL. The full URL of the
                 monitor is subdomain.Region.deadlinecloud.amazonaws.com.

              updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The UNIX timestamp of the date and time that the monitor  was

                 is subdomain.Region.deadlinecloud.amazonaws.com.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If Deadline Cloud returns nextToken , then there  are  more  results
          available.  The  value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for
          each page. To retrieve the next page, call the operation again using
          the  returned  token.  Keep all other arguments unchanged. If no re-
          sults remain, then nextToken is set to null . Each pagination  token
          expires  after  24  hours.  If you provide a token that isn't valid,
          then you receive an HTTP 400 ValidationException error.
