NAME
       get-sessions-statistics-aggregation -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  set of statistics for queues or farms. Before you can call the
       GetSessionStatisticsAggregation operation,  you  must  first  call  the
       StartSessionsStatisticsAggregation  operation. Statistics are available
       for 1 hour after you call the StartSessionsStatisticsAggregation opera-
       tion.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-sessions-statistics-aggregation  is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: statistics

OPTIONS
       --farm-id (string)
          The identifier of the farm to include in the statistics. This should
          be  the  same  as  the farm ID used in the call to the StartSession-
          sStatisticsAggregation operation.

       --aggregation-id (string)
          The identifier returned  by  the  StartSessionsStatisticsAggregation
          operation that identifies the aggregated statistics.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

          the  returned  token.  Keep all other arguments unchanged. If no re-
          sults remain, then nextToken is set to null . Each pagination  token
          expires  after  24  hours.  If you provide a token that isn't valid,

          the StartSessionsStatisticsAggregation operation  after  you  reduce
          the aggregation time frame, reduce the number of queues or fleets in
          the aggregation, or increase the period length.

          If you call the  StartSessionsStatisticsAggregation  operation  when
          the status is IN_PROGRESS , you will receive a ThrottlingException .
