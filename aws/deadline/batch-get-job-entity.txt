NAME
       batch-get-job-entity -

DESCRIPTION
       Get batched job details for a worker.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       batch-get-job-entity  uses  document type values. Document types follow
       the JSON data model where valid values are: strings, numbers, booleans,
       null, arrays, and objects. For command input, options and nested param-
       eters that are labeled with the type document must be provided as JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
