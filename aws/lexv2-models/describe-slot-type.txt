OPTIONS
       --slot-type-id (string)
          The identifier of the slot type.

       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot associated with the slot type.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot associated with the slot type.

       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the language and locale of the slot type to de-
          scribe. The string must match one of the supported locales. For more
          information, see Supported languages .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       slotTypeId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the slot type.

       slotTypeName -> (string)

          The  values  that  the slot type can take. Includes any synonyms for
          the slot type values.

          (structure)
              Each slot type can have a set of values. Each SlotTypeValue rep-
              resents a value that the slot type can take.

              sampleValue -> (structure)
                 The value of the slot type entry.

                 value -> (string)

              synonyms -> (list)
                 Additional values related to the slot type entry.

                 (structure)
                     Defines one of the values for a slot type.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value that can be used for a slot type.

       valueSelectionSetting -> (structure)
          The  strategy  that Amazon Lex uses to choose a value from a list of
          possible values.

          resolutionStrategy -> (string)
              Determines the slot resolution strategy that Amazon Lex uses  to
              return slot type values. The field can be set to one of the fol-
              lowing values:

              o ORIGINAL_VALUE - Returns the value entered by the user, if the
                user value is similar to the slot value.

              o TOP_RESOLUTION  -  If there is a resolution list for the slot,
                return the first value in the resolution list as the slot type
                value. If there is no resolution list, null is returned.

              If you don't specify the valueSelectionStrategy , the default is
              ORIGINAL_VALUE .

          regexFilter -> (structure)
              A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

                 " u0041" or " u005A".

                 The following regular expression operators are not supported:

                 o Infinite repeaters:
                   *
