LIST-SESSION-METRICS()                                  LIST-SESSION-METRICS()



NAME
       list-session-metrics -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves summary metrics for the user sessions with your bot. The fol-
       lowing fields are required:

       o metrics  A list of AnalyticsSessionMetric objects.  In  each  object,
         use  the name field to specify the metric to calculate, the statistic
         field to specify whether to calculate the Sum , Average , or Max num-
         ber,  and  the  order field to specify whether to sort the results in
         Ascending or Descending order.

       o startDateTime and endDateTime  Define a time range for which you want
         to retrieve results.

       Of  the  optional fields, you can organize the results in the following
       ways:

       o Use the filters field to filter the results,  the  groupBy  field  to
         specify categories by which to group the results, and the binBy field
         to specify time intervals by which to group the results.

       o Use the maxResults field to limit the number of results to return  in
         a single response and the nextToken field to return the next batch of
         results if the response does not return the full set of results.

       Note that an order field exists in both binBy and metrics .  Currently,
       you can specify it in either field, but not in both.

              values -> (list)
                 An  array  containing  the values of the category by which to
                 apply the operator to filter the  results.  You  can  provide
                 multiple  values if the operator is EQ or CO . If you provide
                 multiple values, you filter for  results  that  equal/contain
                 any  of the values. For example, if the name , operator , and
                 values fields are Modality , EQ , and [Speech,  Text]  ,  the
                 operation  filters  for results where the modality was either
                 Speech or Text .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,operator=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "BotAliasId"|"BotVersion"|"LocaleId"|"Modality"|"Channel"|"Duration"|"ConversationEndState"|"SessionId"|"OriginatingRequestId"|"IntentPath",

              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in each page of results.  If
          there  are fewer results than the maximum page size, only the actual
          number of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from the ListSessionMetrics operation contains  more
          results  than  specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is re-
          turned in the response.

          Use the returned token in the nextToken parameter of a  ListSession-
          Metrics  request  to return the next page of results. For a complete
          set of results, call  the  ListSessionMetrics  operation  until  the
          nextToken returned in the response is null.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
