SYNOPSIS
            describe-import
          --import-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --import-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the import to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

          ulary.

          botImportSpecification -> (structure)
              Parameters for importing a bot.

                 zon Lex handles special cases of securing the data  for  your
                 bot.

                 childDirected -> (boolean)
                     For each Amazon Lex bot created with the Amazon Lex Model
                     Building Service, you must specify whether  your  use  of
                     Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other ap-
                     plication that is directed or targeted, in  whole  or  in
                     part,  to  children under age 13 and subject to the Chil-
                     dren's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by  specify-
                     ing true or false in the childDirected field. By specify-
                     ing true in the childDirected  field,  you  confirm  that
                     your  use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program,

                     whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to
                     COPPA. By specifying false in  the  childDirected  field,
                     you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is not related to
                     a website, program, or other application that is directed
                     or  targeted,  in whole or in part, to children under age

                     value  for  the  childDirected  field that does not accu-
                     rately reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is  related
                     to  a  website, program, or other application that is di-
                     rected or targeted, in whole or in part, to children  un-
                     der  age  13  and subject to COPPA. If your use of Amazon
                     Lex relates to a website, program, or  other  application
                     that  is  directed in whole or in part, to children under
                     age 13, you must obtain any required verifiable  parental
                     consent under COPPA. For information regarding the use of
                     Amazon Lex in  connection  with  websites,  programs,  or
                     other  applications  that  are  directed  or targeted, in
                     whole or in part, to  children  under  age  13,  see  the
                     Amazon Lex FAQ .

              idleSessionTTLInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The time, in seconds, that Amazon Lex should keep information
                 about a user's conversation with the bot.

                 A user interaction remains active  for  the  amount  of  time
                 specified.  If  no  conversation occurs during this time, the
                 session expires and Amazon Lex deletes any data provided  be-
                 fore the timeout.

                 You  can  specify between 60 (1 minute) and 86,400 (24 hours)
                 seconds.

              botTags -> (map)
                 A list of tags to add to the bot. You can only add tags  when
                 you  import  a  bot. You can't use the UpdateBot operation to
                 update tags. To update tags, use the TagResource operation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              testBotAliasTags -> (map)
                 A list of tags to add to the test alias for a  bot.  You  can
                 only  add  tags  when you import a bot. You can't use the Up-
                 dateAlias operation to update tags. To  update  tags  on  the
                 test alias, use the TagResource operation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

          botLocaleImportSpecification -> (structure)
              Parameters for importing a bot locale.

              botId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the bot to import the locale to.

              botVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the bot to import the locale to. This can only
                 be the DRAFT version of the bot.

              localeId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the language and locale that the  bot  will
                 be  used  in.  The string must match one of the supported lo-
                 cales. All of the intents, slot types, and slots used in  the
                 bot  must  have  the  same  locale. For more information, see
                 Supported languages .

              nluIntentConfidenceThreshold -> (double)
                 Determines the threshold where Amazon  Lex  will  insert  the
                 AMAZON.FallbackIntent  ,  AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent , or both
                 when returning alternative intents. AMAZON.FallbackIntent and
                 AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent  are only inserted if they are con-
                 figured for the bot.

                 For example, suppose a bot is configured with the  confidence
                 threshold  of 0.80 and the AMAZON.FallbackIntent . Amazon Lex
                 returns three alternative intents with the  following  confi-
                 dence scores: IntentA (0.70), IntentB (0.60), IntentC (0.50).
                 The response from the PostText operation would be:

                 o AMAZON.FallbackIntent

                 o IntentA

                 o IntentB

                 o IntentC

              voiceSettings -> (structure)
                 Defines settings for using an Amazon Polly voice to  communi-
                 cate with a user.

                 voiceId -> (string)
                     The identifier of the Amazon Polly voice to use.

                 engine -> (string)
                     Indicates  the type of Amazon Polly voice that Amazon Lex
                     should use for voice interaction with the user. For  more
                     information,  see  the  ` engine parameter of the Synthe-
