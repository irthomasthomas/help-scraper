OPTIONS
       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale of the slot types to list.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --sort-by (structure)
          Determines the sort order for the response from the ListBuiltInSlot-
          Types operation. You can choose to sort by the slot  type  signature
          in either ascending or descending order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list of built-in intents.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the list. You can choose ascending or descend-
              ing.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "SlotTypeSignature",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of built-in slot types to return in each page  of
          results. If there are fewer results than the max page size, only the
          actual number of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from  the  ListBuiltInSlotTypes  operation  contains
          more  results than specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is
          returned in the response. Use that token in the nextToken  parameter
          to return the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       builtInSlotTypeSummaries -> (list)
          Summary information for the built-in slot types that meet the filter
          criteria specified in the request. The length of the list is  speci-
          fied  in  the maxResults parameter of the request. If there are more
          slot types available, the nextToken field contains a  token  to  get
          the next page of results.

          (structure)
              Provides  summary information about a built-in slot type for the
              ListBuiltInSlotTypes operation.

              slotTypeSignature -> (string)
                 The signature of the built-in slot type. Use this to  specify
                 the parent slot type of a derived slot type.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the built-in slot type.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response to the ListBuiltInSlotTypes  operation.  If  the  nextToken
          field  is  present, you send the contents as the nextToken parameter
          of a LIstBuiltInSlotTypes operation request to get the next page  of
          results.

       localeId -> (string)
          The language and locale of the slot types in the list.
