OPTIONS
       --test-execution-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of  the  test  execution to list the result
          items.

       --result-filter-by (structure)
          The filter for the list of results from the test set execution.

          resultTypeFilter -> (string)
              Specifies which results to filter. See Test result details">Test
              results details for details about different types of results.

          conversationLevelTestResultsFilterBy -> (structure)
              Contains information about the method for filtering Conversation
              level test results.

              endToEndResult -> (string)
                 The selection of matched or mismatched end-to-end  status  to
                 filter test set results data at the conversation level.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          resultTypeFilter=string,conversationLevelTestResultsFilterBy={endToEndResult=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "resultTypeFilter": "OverallTestResults"|"ConversationLevelTestResults"|"IntentClassificationTestResults"|"SlotResolutionTestResults"|"UtteranceLevelResults",
            "conversationLevelTestResultsFilterBy": {
              "endToEndResult": "Matched"|"Mismatched"|"ExecutionError"
            }
          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of test execution result items to return in each
          page. If there are fewer results than the max page  size,  only  the
          actual number of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from the ListTestExecutionResultItems operation con-
          tains more results than specified in the maxResults parameter, a to-
          ken is returned in the response. Use that token in the nextToken pa-
          rameter to return the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
