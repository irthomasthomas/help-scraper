LIST-INTENT-PATHS()                                        LIST-INTENT-PATHS()



NAME
       list-intent-paths -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves summary statistics for a path of intents that users take over
       sessions with your bot. The following fields are required:

       o startDateTime and endDateTime  Define a time range for which you want
         to retrieve results.

       o intentPath  Define an order of intents for which you want to retrieve
         metrics. Separate intents in the path with a forward slash. For exam-
         ple, populate the intentPath field with /BookCar/BookHotel to see de-
         tails about how many times users invoked the  BookCar  and  BookHotel
         intents in that order.

       Use the optional filters field to filter the results.

OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The  identifier  for  the  bot for which you want to retrieve intent
          path metrics.

       --start-date-time (timestamp)
          The date and time that marks the beginning of the range of time  for
          which you want to see intent path metrics.

       --end-date-time (timestamp)
          The  date and time that marks the end of the range of time for which
          you want to see intent path metrics.

       --intent-path (string)
          The intent path for which you want to retrieve metrics. Use  a  for-
          ward slash to separate intents in the path. For example:

          o /BookCar

          o /BookCar/BookHotel

          o /BookHotel/BookCar

       --filters (list)
          A  list  of objects, each describes a condition by which you want to
          filter the results.

          (structure)
              Contains fields describing a condition by which  to  filter  the
              paths.  The expression may be understood as name  operator  val-
              ues . For example:

              o LocaleId EQ en  The locale is "en".

              o BotVersion EQ 2  The bot version is equal to two.

              The operators that each filter supports are listed below:

              o BotAlias  EQ .

              o BotVersion  EQ .

              o LocaleId  EQ .

              o Modality  EQ .

              o Channel  EQ .

              name -> (string)
                 The category by which to filter the  intent  paths.  The  de-
                 scriptions for each option are as follows:

                 o BotAlias  The name of the bot alias.

                 o BotVersion  The version of the bot.

                 o LocaleId  The locale of the bot.

                 o Modality   The modality of the session with the bot (audio,
                   DTMF, or text).

                 o Channel  The channel that the bot is integrated with.

              operator -> (string)
                 The operation by which to filter the category. The  following
                 operations are possible:

                 o CO  Contains

                 o EQ  Equals

                 o GT  Greater than

                 o LT  Less than

                 The operators that each filter supports are listed below:

                 o BotAlias  EQ .

                 o BotVersion  EQ .

                 o LocaleId  EQ .

                 o Modality  EQ .

                 o Channel  EQ .

              values -> (list)
                 An  array  containing  the values of the category by which to
                 apply the operator to filter the  results.  You  can  provide
                 multiple  values if the operator is EQ or CO . If you provide
                 multiple values, you filter for  results  that  equal/contain
                 any  of the values. For example, if the name , operator , and
                 values fields are Modality , EQ , and [Speech,  Text]  ,  the
                 operation  filters  for results where the modality was either
                 Speech or Text .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,operator=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "BotAliasId"|"BotVersion"|"LocaleId"|"Modality"|"Channel",
              "operator": "EQ"|"GT"|"LT",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
