LIST-BUILT-IN-INTENTS()                                LIST-BUILT-IN-INTENTS()



NAME
       list-built-in-intents -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of built-in intents provided by Amazon Lex that you can use
       in your bot.

       To use a built-in intent as a the base for your own intent, include the
       built-in  intent  signature in the parentIntentSignature parameter when
       you  call  the  CreateIntent  operation.  For  more  information,   see
       CreateIntent .

OPTIONS
       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the language and locale of the intents to list.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --sort-by (structure)
          Specifies  sorting  parameters for the list of built-in intents. You
          can specify that the list be sorted by the built-in intent signature
          in either ascending or descending order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list of built-in intents.

          order -> (string)
              The  order  to  sort  the list. You can specify ascending or de-
              scending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "IntentSignature",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of built-in intents to return in each page of re-
          sults.  If  there are fewer results than the max page size, only the
          actual number of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from the ListBuiltInIntents operation contains  more
          results  than  specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is re-
          turned in the response. Use that token in the nextToken parameter to
          return the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       builtInIntentSummaries -> (list)
          Summary information for the built-in intents that  meet  the  filter
          criteria  specified in the request. The length of the list is speci-
          fied in the maxResults parameter of the request. If there  are  more
          intents  available,  the nextToken field contains a token to get the
          next page of results.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information about a  built-in  intent  for  the
              ListBuiltInIntents operation.

              intentSignature -> (string)
                 The signature of the built-in intent. Use this to specify the
                 parent intent of a derived intent.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the intent.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response to the ListBuiltInIntents operation. If the nextToken field
          is present, you send the contents as the nextToken  parameter  of  a
          ListBotAliases operation request to get the next page of results.

       localeId -> (string)
          The language and locale of the intents in the list.
