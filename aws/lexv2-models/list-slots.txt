          tion, see Supported languages .

       --intent-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the intent that contains the slot.

       --sort-by (structure)
          Determines the sort order for the response from the ListSlots opera-
          tion. You can choose to sort by the slot name or last  updated  date
          in either ascending or descending order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the list. You can choose ascending or descend-

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "SlotName"|"LastUpdatedDateTime",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --filters (list)
          Provides the specification of a filter used to limit  the  slots  in
          the  response to only those that match the filter specification. You
          can only specify one filter and only one string to filter on.

          (structure)
              Filters the response from the ListSlots operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the field to use for filtering.

              values -> (list)
                 The value to use to filter the response.

                 (string)

              operator -> (string)
                 The operator to use for the filter. Specify EQ when the List-
                 Slots  operation  should  return  only aliases that equal the
                 specified value. Specify  CO  when  the  ListSlots  operation
                 should return aliases that contain the specified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "SlotName",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "operator": "CO"|"EQ"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of slots to return in each page of results. If
          there are fewer results than the max page size, only the actual num-
          ber of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  response from the ListSlots operation contains more results
          than specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is  returned  in
          the  response.  Use  that token in the nextToken parameter to return
          the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

                            ations are defined, Amazon Lex chooses the primary
                            message  or  one  of the variations to send to the

                                      displaying  the response card has access
                                      to the image.

                                      rangement of the buttons  is  determined
                                      by  the  platform that displays the but-

          Slots operation request to get the next page of results.
