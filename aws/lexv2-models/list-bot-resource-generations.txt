OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The  unique identifier of the bot whose generation requests you want
          to view.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot whose generation requests you want to view.

       --locale-id (string)
          The locale of the bot whose generation requests you want to view.

       --sort-by (structure)
          An object containing information about the attribute and the  method
          by which to sort the results

          attribute -> (string)
              The  attribute  by which to sort the generation request informa-
              tion. You can sort by the following attributes.

              o creationStartTime  The time at which  the  generation  request
                was created.

              o lastUpdatedTime   The time at which the generation request was
                last updated.

          order -> (string)
              The order by which to sort the generation request information.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "creationStartTime"|"lastUpdatedTime",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in the response.

       --next-token (string)
          If the total number of results is greater than the number  specified
          in  the  maxResults  , the response returns a token in the nextToken
          field. Use this token when making a request to return the next batch
          of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       botId -> (string)

              creationDateTime -> (timestamp)

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time at which the generation request was last
                 updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the total number of results is greater than the number  specified
          in  the  maxResults  , the response returns a token in the nextToken
