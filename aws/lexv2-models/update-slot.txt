                                   the  bot.  You  can choose to use the value
                                   entered by the user, or you can have Amazon
                                   Lex choose the first value in the resolved-
                                   Values list.

                            values -> (list)
                               A list of one or more values that the user pro-
                               vided  for  the  slot.  For example, for a slot

                                      When the shape value is List , it  indi-
                                      cates  that  the values field contains a
                                      list of slot values. When the  value  is
                                      Scalar  ,  it  indicates  that the value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                   value -> (structure)

                                          pends on the setting  of  the  value
                                          selection  strategy for the bot. You
                                          can choose to use the value  entered
                                          by  the user, or you can have Amazon
                                          Lex choose the first  value  in  the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                   values -> (list)

                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When  the  shape  value is List , it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains  a  list  of slot values. When
                                          the value is Scalar ,  it  indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                             mines  for  the  slot. The actual
                                             value depends on the  setting  of
                                             the  value selection strategy for
                                             the bot. You can  choose  to  use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you can have  Amazon  Lex  choose
                                             the  first value in the resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                      values -> (list)

                                          the  user provided for the slot. For
                                          example, for  a  slot  that  elicits
                                          pizza  toppings, the values might be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          (structure)

                                             a dialog step.

                                             shape -> (string)
                                                 When the shape value is  List
                                                 ,  it indicates that the val-
                                                 ues field contains a list  of
                                                 slot  values.  When the value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the  value  field  contains a
                                                 single value.

                                                 interpretedValue -> (string)
                                                    The  value that Amazon Lex
                                                    determines for  the  slot.
                                                    The  actual  value depends
                                                    on  the  setting  of   the
                                                    value  selection  strategy
                                                    for  the  bot.   You   can
                                                    choose  to  use  the value
                                                    entered by  the  user,  or
                                                    you  can  have  Amazon Lex
                                                    choose the first value  in
                                                    the resolvedValues list.

                                                 the  slot. For example, for a
                                                 slot that elicits pizza  top-
                                                 pings,  the  values  might be
                                                 "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                      When  the shape value is List , it indi-
                                      cates that the values field  contains  a
                                      list  of  slot values. When the value is
                                      Scalar , it  indicates  that  the  value

                                          for the slot. The actual  value  de-
                                          pends  on  the  setting of the value
                                          selection strategy for the bot.  You
                                          can  choose to use the value entered
                                          by the user, or you can have  Amazon
                                          Lex  choose  the  first value in the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                      user provided for the slot. For example,
                                      for a slot that elicits pizza  toppings,
                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                   A  map  of  all of the slot value overrides
                                   for the intent. The name of the  slot  maps
                                   to  the  value  of the slot. Slots that are
                                   not included in the map aren't overridden.,

                                   key -> (string)

                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When the shape value is  List  ,  it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                      value -> (structure)

                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose
                                             the first value in the  resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                      values -> (list)

                                          the user provided for the slot.  For
                                          example,  for  a  slot  that elicits
                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          (structure)

                                             a dialog step.

                                             shape -> (string)
                                                 When  the shape value is List
                                                 , it indicates that the  val-
                                                 ues  field contains a list of
                                                 slot values. When  the  value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the value  field  contains  a
                                                 single value.

                                                 interpretedValue -> (string)
                                                    The value that Amazon  Lex
                                                    determines  for  the slot.
                                                    The actual  value  depends
                                                    on   the  setting  of  the
                                                    value  selection  strategy
                                                    for   the   bot.  You  can
                                                    choose to  use  the  value
                                                    entered  by  the  user, or
                                                    you can  have  Amazon  Lex
                                                    choose  the first value in
                                                    the resolvedValues list.

                                                 the slot. For example, for  a
                                                 slot  that elicits pizza top-
                                                 pings, the  values  might  be
                                                 "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                             When the value is Scalar , it in-
                                             dicates that the value field con-

                                                 actual value depends  on  the

                            slots -> (map)
                               A  map  of  all of the slot value overrides for
                               the intent. The name of the slot  maps  to  the
                               value  of the slot. Slots that are not included
                               in the map aren't overridden.,

                               key -> (string)

                               value -> (structure)

                                   shape -> (string)
                                      When  the shape value is List , it indi-
                                      cates that the values field  contains  a
                                      list  of  slot values. When the value is
                                      Scalar , it  indicates  that  the  value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                   value -> (structure)
                                      The current value of the slot.

                                          for the slot. The actual  value  de-
                                          pends  on  the  setting of the value
                                          selection strategy for the bot.  You
                                          can  choose to use the value entered
                                          by the user, or you can have  Amazon
                                          Lex  choose  the  first value in the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                      user provided for the slot. For example,
                                      for a slot that elicits pizza  toppings,
                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                      (structure)
                                          The slot values that Amazon Lex uses
                                          when it sets slot values in a dialog
                                          step.

                                          shape -> (string)
                                             When the shape value is List , it
                                             indicates  that  the values field
                                             contains a list of  slot  values.
                                             When the value is Scalar , it in-
                                             dicates that the value field con-
                                             tains a single value.

                                          value -> (structure)
                                             The current value of the slot.

                                                 termines for  the  slot.  The
                                                 actual  value  depends on the
                                                 setting of the  value  selec-
                                                 tion  strategy  for  the bot.
                                                 You can  choose  to  use  the
                                                 value entered by the user, or
                                                 you  can  have   Amazon   Lex
                                                 choose the first value in the
                                                 resolvedValues list.

                                             A list of one or more values that
                                             the  user  provided for the slot.
                                             For  example,  for  a  slot  that
                                             elicits  pizza toppings, the val-
                                             ues  might  be  "pepperoni"   and

                                                        slot. The actual value
                                                        depends on the setting

                                          The slot values that Amazon Lex uses
                                          when it sets slot values in a dialog
                                          step.

                                          shape -> (string)
                                             When the shape value is List , it
                                             indicates that the  values  field
                                             contains  a  list of slot values.
                                             When the value is Scalar , it in-
                                             dicates that the value field con-
                                             tains a single value.

                                          value -> (structure)

                                                 termines  for  the  slot. The
                                                 actual value depends  on  the
                                                 setting  of  the value selec-
                                                 tion strategy  for  the  bot.
                                                 You  can  choose  to  use the
                                                 value entered by the user, or
                                                 you   can   have  Amazon  Lex
                                                 choose the first value in the
                                                 resolvedValues list.

                                          pends  on  the  setting of the value
                                          selection strategy for the bot.  You
                                          can  choose to use the value entered
                                          by the user, or you can have  Amazon
                                          Lex  choose  the  first value in the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                             When the shape value is List , it
                                             indicates  that  the values field
                                             contains a list of  slot  values.
                                             When the value is Scalar , it in-
                                             dicates that the value field con-
                                             tains a single value.

                                                 termines for  the  slot.  The
                                                 actual  value  depends on the
                                                 setting of the  value  selec-
                                                 tion  strategy  for  the bot.
                                                 You can  choose  to  use  the
                                                 value entered by the user, or
                                                 you  can  have   Amazon   Lex

                                             elicits  pizza toppings, the val-
                                             ues  might  be  "pepperoni"   and

                                                        is List , it indicates

                                                        slot. The actual value
                                                        depends on the setting

          CloudWatch logs.

          obfuscationSettingType -> (string)
              Value that determines whether Amazon Lex obscures slot values in
              conversation logs. The default is to obscure the values.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          obfuscationSettingType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "obfuscationSettingType": "None"|"DefaultObfuscation"
          }

       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot that contains the slot.

       --bot-version (string)
          The  version of the bot that contains the slot. Must always be DRAFT
          .

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale that  contains  the  slot.
          The  string must match one of the supported locales. For more infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --intent-id (string)
          The identifier of the intent that contains the slot.

       --multiple-values-setting (structure)
          Determines whether the slot accepts multiple values in one response.
          Multiple  value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you
          set this value to true in any other locale, Amazon Lex throws a Val-
          idationException .

          If  the multipleValuesSetting is not set, the default value is false
          .

          allowMultipleValues -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether a slot can return multiple values. When true ,
              the  slot  may  return  more  than one value in a response. When
              false , the slot returns only a single value.

              Multi-value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you
              set  this value to true in any other locale, Amazon Lex throws a
              ValidationException .

              If the allowMutlipleValues is not  set,  the  default  value  is
              false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          allowMultipleValues=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "allowMultipleValues": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                               When the shape value is  List  ,  it  indicates
                               that  the  values field contains a list of slot
                               values. When the value is Scalar , it indicates
                               that the value field contains a single value.

                                   the bot. You can choose to  use  the  value
                                   entered by the user, or you can have Amazon
                                   Lex choose the first value in the resolved-
                                   Values list.

                               vided for the slot. For  example,  for  a  slot
                               that  elicits  pizza toppings, the values might
                               be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                      When  the shape value is List , it indi-
                                      cates that the values field  contains  a
                                      list  of  slot values. When the value is
                                      Scalar , it  indicates  that  the  value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                   value -> (structure)

                                          for the slot. The actual  value  de-
                                          pends  on  the  setting of the value
                                          selection strategy for the bot.  You
                                          can  choose to use the value entered
                                          by the user, or you can have  Amazon
                                          Lex  choose  the  first value in the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                   values -> (list)

                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                      value -> (structure)

                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose
                                             the first value in the  resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                      values -> (list)
                                          A  list  of  one or more values that
                                          the user provided for the slot.  For
                                          example,  for  a  slot  that elicits
                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          (structure)

                                             uses when it sets slot values  in
                                             a dialog step.

                                             shape -> (string)
                                                 When  the shape value is List
                                                 , it indicates that the  val-
                                                 ues  field contains a list of
                                                 slot values. When  the  value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the value  field  contains  a
                                                 single value.

                                                    determines  for  the slot.
                                                    The actual  value  depends
                                                    on   the  setting  of  the
                                                    value  selection  strategy
                                                    for   the   bot.  You  can
                                                    choose to  use  the  value
                                                    entered  by  the  user, or
                                                    you can  have  Amazon  Lex
                                                    choose  the first value in
                                                    the resolvedValues list.

                                                 the slot. For example, for  a
                                                 slot  that elicits pizza top-
                                                 pings, the  values  might  be
                                                 "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                      list of slot values. When the  value  is
                                      Scalar  ,  it  indicates  that the value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                          pends on the setting  of  the  value
                                          selection  strategy for the bot. You
                                          can choose to use the value  entered
                                          by  the user, or you can have Amazon
                                          Lex choose the first  value  in  the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                          step.

                                          shape -> (string)
                                             When the shape value is List , it
                                             indicates that the  values  field
                                             contains  a  list of slot values.
                                             When the value is Scalar , it in-
                                             dicates that the value field con-
                                             tains a single value.

                                                 termines  for  the  slot. The
                                                 actual value depends  on  the
                                                 setting  of  the value selec-
                                                 tion strategy  for  the  bot.
                                                 You  can  choose  to  use the
                                                 value entered by the user, or
                                                 you   can   have  Amazon  Lex
                                                 choose the first value in the

                                             elicits pizza toppings, the  val-
                                             ues   might  be  "pepperoni"  and

                               When  the  shape  value  is List , it indicates
                               that the values field contains a list  of  slot
                               values. When the value is Scalar , it indicates
                               that the value field contains a single value.

                            value -> (structure)

                                   the  bot.  You  can choose to use the value
                                   entered by the user, or you can have Amazon
                                   Lex choose the first value in the resolved-
                                   Values list.

                            values -> (list)
                               A list of one or more values that the user pro-
                               vided  for  the  slot.  For example, for a slot
                               that elicits pizza toppings, the  values  might

                                      When the shape value is List , it  indi-
                                      cates  that  the values field contains a
                                      list of slot values. When the  value  is
                                      Scalar  ,  it  indicates  that the value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                   value -> (structure)

                                          pends on the setting  of  the  value
                                          selection  strategy for the bot. You
                                          can choose to use the value  entered
                                          by  the user, or you can have Amazon
                                          Lex choose the first  value  in  the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                   values -> (list)

                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                   A map of all of the  slot  value  overrides
                                   for  the  intent. The name of the slot maps
                                   to the value of the slot.  Slots  that  are
                                   not included in the map aren't overridden.,

                                   key -> (string)

                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When  the  shape  value is List , it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains  a  list  of slot values. When
                                          the value is Scalar ,  it  indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                             The value that Amazon Lex  deter-
                                             mines  for  the  slot. The actual
                                             value depends on the  setting  of
                                             the  value selection strategy for
                                             the bot. You can  choose  to  use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you can have  Amazon  Lex  choose
                                             the  first value in the resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                      values -> (list)

                                          the  user provided for the slot. For
                                          example, for  a  slot  that  elicits
                                          pizza  toppings, the values might be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          (structure)

                                             uses  when it sets slot values in
                                             a dialog step.

                                             shape -> (string)
                                                 When the shape value is  List
                                                 ,  it indicates that the val-
                                                 ues field contains a list  of
                                                 slot  values.  When the value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the  value  field  contains a
                                                 single value.

                                                 slot.

                                                 interpretedValue -> (string)
                                                    The  value that Amazon Lex
                                                    determines for  the  slot.
                                                    The  actual  value depends
                                                    on  the  setting  of   the
                                                    value  selection  strategy
                                                    for  the  bot.   You   can
                                                    choose  to  use  the value
                                                    entered by  the  user,  or
                                                    you  can  have  Amazon Lex
                                                    choose the first value  in
                                                    the resolvedValues list.

                                                 the  slot. For example, for a
                                                 slot that elicits pizza  top-
                                                 pings,  the  values  might be

                                          can  choose to use the value entered
                                          by the user, or you can have  Amazon
                                          Lex  choose  the  first value in the

                        intent -> (structure)
                            Override settings to configure the intent state.

                            name -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  intent.  Only required when
                               you're switching intents.

                            slots -> (map)
                               A map of all of the slot  value  overrides  for
                               the  intent.  The  name of the slot maps to the
                               value of the slot. Slots that are not  included
                               in the map aren't overridden.,

                               key -> (string)

                               value -> (structure)
                                   The  slot  values that Amazon Lex uses when
                                   it sets slot values in a dialog step.

                                   shape -> (string)
                                      When the shape value is List , it  indi-
                                      cates  that  the values field contains a
                                      list of slot values. When the  value  is
                                      Scalar  ,  it  indicates  that the value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                   value -> (structure)
                                      The current value of the slot.

                                      interpretedValue -> (string)

                                          for  the  slot. The actual value de-
                                          pends on the setting  of  the  value
                                          selection  strategy for the bot. You
                                          can choose to use the value  entered
                                          by  the user, or you can have Amazon
                                          Lex choose the first  value  in  the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                      A  list  of  one or more values that the
                                      user provided for the slot. For example,
                                      for  a slot that elicits pizza toppings,
                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                      (structure)
                                          The slot values that Amazon Lex uses
                                          when it sets slot values in a dialog
                                          step.

                                          shape -> (string)
                                             When the shape value is List , it
                                             indicates that the  values  field
                                             contains  a  list of slot values.
                                             When the value is Scalar , it in-
                                             dicates that the value field con-
                                             tains a single value.

                                          value -> (structure)
                                             The current value of the slot.

                                                 termines  for  the  slot. The
                                                 actual value depends  on  the
                                                 setting  of  the value selec-
                                                 tion strategy  for  the  bot.
                                                 You  can  choose  to  use the
                                                 value entered by the user, or
                                                 you   can   have  Amazon  Lex
                                                 choose the first value in the
                                                 resolvedValues list.

                                             A list of one or more values that
                                             the user provided for  the  slot.
                                             For  example,  for  a  slot  that
                                             elicits pizza toppings, the  val-

                                          selection strategy for the bot.  You
                                          can  choose to use the value entered
                                          by the user, or you can have  Amazon
                                          Lex  choose  the  first value in the

                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                                 termines for  the  slot.  The
                                                 actual  value  depends on the
                                                 setting of the  value  selec-
                                                 tion  strategy  for  the bot.

                               value of the slot. Slots that are not  included
                               in the map aren't overridden.,

                               key -> (string)

                                   shape -> (string)
                                      When the shape value is List , it  indi-
                                      cates  that  the values field contains a
                                      list of slot values. When the  value  is
                                      Scalar  ,  it  indicates  that the value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                   value -> (structure)

                                          for  the  slot. The actual value de-
                                          pends on the setting  of  the  value
                                          selection  strategy for the bot. You
                                          can choose to use the value  entered
                                          by  the user, or you can have Amazon
                                          Lex choose the first  value  in  the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                      user provided for the slot. For example,
                                      for  a slot that elicits pizza toppings,
                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                          The slot values that Amazon Lex uses
                                          when it sets slot values in a dialog
                                          step.

                                          shape -> (string)
                                             When the shape value is List , it
                                             indicates that the  values  field
                                             contains  a  list of slot values.
                                             When the value is Scalar , it in-
                                             dicates that the value field con-
                                             tains a single value.

                                          value -> (structure)
                                             The current value of the slot.

                                                 termines  for  the  slot. The
                                                 actual value depends  on  the
                                                 setting  of  the value selec-
                                                 tion strategy  for  the  bot.
                                                 You  can  choose  to  use the
                                                 value entered by the user, or
                                                 you   can   have  Amazon  Lex
                                                 choose the first value in the

                                             the user provided for  the  slot.
                                             For  example,  for  a  slot  that
                                             elicits pizza toppings, the  val-
                                             ues   might  be  "pepperoni"  and
