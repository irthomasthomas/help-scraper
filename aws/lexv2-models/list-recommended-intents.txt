OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot associated with the recommended in-
          tents.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the recommended intents.

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale  of  the  recommended  in-
          tents.

       --bot-recommendation-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the bot recommendation that contains the recom-
          mended intents.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from the ListRecommendedIntents  operation  contains
          more  results than specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is
          returned in the response. Use that token in the nextToken  parameter
          to return the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of bot recommendations to return in each page of
          results. If there are fewer results than the max page size, only the
          actual number of results are returned.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          tent.

       botVersion -> (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the intent.

       localeId -> (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale of the  intents  to  list.

          mended intent.

       summaryList -> (list)
          Summary  information  for  the intents that meet the filter criteria
          specified in the request. The length of the list is specified in the
          maxResults  parameter  of  the  request.  If  there are more intents
          available, the nextToken field contains a token to get the next page
          of results.

          (structure)
              An object that contains a summary of a recommended intent.

              intentId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of a recommended intent associated with
                 the bot recommendation.

              intentName -> (string)
                 The name of a recommended intent associated with the bot rec-
                 ommendation.

              sampleUtterancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  count  of sample utterances of a recommended intent that
                 is associated with a bot recommendation.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response  to  the ListRecommendedIntents operation. If the nextToken
          field is present, you send the contents as the  nextToken  parameter
          of  a  ListRecommendedIntents operation request to get the next page
          of results.
