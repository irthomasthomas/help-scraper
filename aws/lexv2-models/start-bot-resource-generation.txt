START-BOT-RESOURCE-GENERATION()                START-BOT-RESOURCE-GENERATION()



NAME
       start-bot-resource-generation -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  a request for the descriptive bot builder to generate a bot lo-
       cale configuration based on the prompt you provide it. After  you  make
       this  call, use the DescribeBotResourceGeneration operation to check on
       the status of the generation and for the generatedBotLocaleUrl when the
       generation is complete. Use that value to retrieve the Amazon S3 object
       containing the bot locale configuration. You can then modify and import
       this configuration.

OPTIONS
       --generation-input-prompt (string)
          The  prompt  to  generate intents and slot types for the bot locale.
          Your description should be both detailed and precise to help  gener-
          ate  appropriate and sufficient intents for your bot. Include a list
          of actions to improve the intent creation process.

       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot for which to generate  intents  and
          slot types.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot for which to generate intents and slot types.

       --locale-id (string)
          The locale of the bot for which to generate intents and slot types.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
