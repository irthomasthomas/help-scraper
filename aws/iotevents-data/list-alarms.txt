OPTIONS
       --alarm-model-name (string)
          The name of the alarm model.

       --next-token (string)
          The token that you can use to return the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned per request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       alarmSummaries -> (list)
          A list that summarizes each alarm.

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of an alarm.

              alarmModelName -> (string)
                 The name of the alarm model.

              alarmModelVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the alarm model.

              keyValue -> (string)
                 The value of the key used as a  filter  to  select  only  the
                 alarms associated with the key .

              stateName -> (string)
                 The name of the alarm state. The state name can be one of the
                 following values:

                 o DISABLED - When the alarm is  in  the  DISABLED  state,  it
                   isn't ready to evaluate data. To enable the alarm, you must
                   change the alarm to the NORMAL state.

                 o NORMAL - When the alarm is in the NORMAL state, it's  ready
                   to evaluate data.

                 o ACTIVE  - If the alarm is in the ACTIVE state, the alarm is
                   invoked.

                 o ACKNOWLEDGED - When the alarm is in the ACKNOWLEDGED state,
                   the alarm was invoked and you acknowledged the alarm.

                 o SNOOZE_DISABLED  - When the alarm is in the SNOOZE_DISABLED
                   state, the alarm is disabled  for  a  specified  period  of
                   time.  After  the  snooze  time,  the  alarm  automatically
                   changes to the NORMAL state.

                 o LATCHED - When the alarm is in the LATCHED state, the alarm
                   was  invoked. However, the data that the alarm is currently
                   evaluating is within the specified  range.  To  change  the
                   alarm to the NORMAL state, you must acknowledge the alarm.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the alarm was created, in the Unix epoch format.

              lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  the alarm was last updated, in the Unix epoch for-
                 mat.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token that you can use to return the next  set  of  results,  or
          null if there are no more results.
