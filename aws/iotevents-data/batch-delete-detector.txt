BATCH-DELETE-DETECTOR()                                BATCH-DELETE-DETECTOR()



NAME
       batch-delete-detector -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  one  or  more  detectors that were created. When a detector is
       deleted, its state will be cleared and the  detector  will  be  removed
       from  the list of detectors. The deleted detector will no longer appear
       if referenced in the ListDetectors API call.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-delete-detector
          --detectors <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --detectors (list)
          The list of one or more detectors to be deleted.

          (structure)
              Information used to delete the detector model.

              messageId -> (string)
                 The ID to assign to the DeleteDetectorRequest  .  Each  "mes-
                 sageId" must be unique within each batch sent.

              detectorModelName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the detector model that was used to create the
                 detector instance.

              keyValue -> (string)
                 The value of the key used to identify the detector.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          messageId=string,detectorModelName=string,keyValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "messageId": "string",
              "detectorModelName": "string",
              "keyValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       batchDeleteDetectorErrorEntries -> (list)
          A  list of errors associated with the request, or an empty array ([]
          ) if there are no errors. Each error entry contains a messageId that
          helps you identify the entry that failed.

          (structure)
              Contains error messages associated with the deletion request.

              messageId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the message that caused the error. (See the value
                 of the "messageId" in the detectors object of  the  DeleteDe-
                 tectorRequest .)

              errorCode -> (string)
                 The error code.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 A message that describes the error.
