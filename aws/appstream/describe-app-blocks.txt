OPTIONS
       --arns (list)
          The ARNs of the app blocks.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The  pagination  token used to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of each page of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AppBlocks -> (list)
          The app blocks in the list.

          (structure)
              Describes an app block.

              App blocks are an Amazon AppStream 2.0 resource that stores  the
              details  about  the  virtual  hard disk in an S3 bucket. It also
              stores the setup script with details about how to mount the vir-
              tual  hard  disk. The virtual hard disk includes the application
              binaries and other files necessary to launch your  applications.
              Multiple applications can be assigned to a single app block.

              This is only supported for Elastic fleets.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the app block.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the app block.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the app block.

              DisplayName -> (string)
                 The display name of the app block.

                 S3Key -> (string)
                     The S3 key of the S3 object.
