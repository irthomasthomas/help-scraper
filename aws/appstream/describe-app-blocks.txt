OPTIONS
       --arns (list)
          The ARNs of the app blocks.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The  pagination  token used to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of each page of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AppBlocks -> (list)
          The app blocks in the list.

          (structure)
              Describes an app block.

              App  blocks are an Amazon AppStream 2.0 resource that stores the
              details about the virtual hard disk in an  S3  bucket.  It  also
              stores the setup script with details about how to mount the vir-
              tual hard disk. The virtual hard disk includes  the  application
              binaries  and other files necessary to launch your applications.
              Multiple applications can be assigned to a single app block.

              This is only supported for Elastic fleets.

                 The name of the app block.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the app block.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the app block.

              DisplayName -> (string)
                 The display name of the app block.

              SourceS3Location -> (structure)
                 The source S3 location of the app block.

                 S3Bucket -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket of the S3 object.

                 S3Key -> (string)
                     The S3 key of the S3 object.

              SetupScriptDetails -> (structure)
                 The setup script details of the app block.

                 ScriptS3Location -> (structure)
                     The S3 object location for the script.

                     S3Bucket -> (string)
                        The S3 bucket of the S3 object.

                     S3Key -> (string)
                        The S3 key of the S3 object.

                 ExecutablePath -> (string)
                     The run path for the script.

                 ExecutableParameters -> (string)
                     The runtime parameters passed to the  run  path  for  the
                     script.

                 TimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The run timeout, in seconds, for the script.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The created time of the app block.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination  token used to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation.
