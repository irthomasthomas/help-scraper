DESCRIBE-FLEETS()                                            DESCRIBE-FLEETS()



NAME
       describe-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  that describes one or more specified fleets, if the
       fleet names are provided. Otherwise, all fleets in the account are  de-
       scribed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-fleets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Fleets

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          The names of the fleets to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     The  total  number of sessions slots that are either run-
                     ning or pending. This represents the total number of con-
                     current  streaming  sessions  your fleet can support in a
                     steady state.

                     DesiredUserSessionCapacity = ActualUserSessionCapacity  +
                     PendingUserSessionCapacity

                     This only applies to multi-session fleets.

                 AvailableUserSessions -> (integer)
                     The  number of idle session slots currently available for
                     user sessions.

                     - ActiveUserSessions

                     This only applies to multi-session fleets.

                 ActiveUserSessions -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  user  sessions  currently being used for
                     streaming sessions. This only  applies  to  multi-session
                     fleets.

                 ActualUserSessions -> (integer)
                     The  total number of session slots that are available for
                     streaming or are currently streaming.

                 The  maximum  amount of time that a streaming session can re-
                 main active, in seconds. If users are still  connected  to  a
                 streaming instance five minutes before this limit is reached,
                 they are prompted to save any  open  documents  before  being
                 disconnected. After this time elapses, the instance is termi-
                 nated and replaced by a new instance.

                 Specify a value between 600 and 360000.

              DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The amount of time that a streaming  session  remains  active
                 after  users  disconnect.  If  they  try  to reconnect to the
                 streaming session after a disconnection or network  interrup-
                 tion  within  this time interval, they are connected to their
                 previous session. Otherwise, they are connected to a new ses-
                 sion with a new streaming instance.

                 Specify a value between 60 and 36000.

                     face is attached from the fleet instance or image builder
                     instance.  Fleet instances use one or more subnets. Image
                     builder instances use one subnet.

                     (string)

                 SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                     The identifiers of the security groups for the  fleet  or
                     image builder.

                     (string)

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the fleet was created.

              FleetErrors -> (list)
                 The fleet errors.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a fleet error.

                     ErrorCode -> (string)
                        The error code.

                     ErrorMessage -> (string)
                        The error message.

              EnableDefaultInternetAccess -> (boolean)

                 fleet.

              DomainJoinInfo -> (structure)
                 The name of the directory and organizational unit (OU) to use
                 to join the fleet to a Microsoft Active Directory domain.

                 DirectoryName -> (string)
                     The  fully  qualified name of the directory (for example,
                     corp.example.com).

                 OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName -> (string)
                     The distinguished name of  the  organizational  unit  for
                     computer accounts.

              IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of time that users can be idle (inactive) before
                 they are disconnected from their streaming  session  and  the
                 DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds  time  interval  begins. Users are
                 notified before they are disconnected due to  inactivity.  If
                 users  try  to  reconnect to the streaming session before the
                 time   interval   specified   in   DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds
                 elapses,  they are connected to their previous session. Users
                 are considered idle when  they  stop  providing  keyboard  or
                 mouse  input during their streaming session. File uploads and
                 downloads, audio in, audio out, and pixels  changing  do  not
                 qualify  as user activity. If users continue to be idle after
                 the time interval in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds  elapses,
                 they are disconnected.

                 To  prevent  users from being disconnected due to inactivity,
                 specify a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value  between  60
                 and 36000. The default value is 0.

                 NOTE:
                     If you enable this feature, we recommend that you specify
                     a value that corresponds exactly to  a  whole  number  of
                     minutes  (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don't do
                     this, the value is rounded to the nearest minute. For ex-
                     ample,  if  you  specify a value of 70, users are discon-
                     nected after 1 minute of inactivity.  If  you  specify  a
                     value  that is at the midpoint between two different min-
                     utes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you  spec-
                     ify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes
                     of inactivity.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the fleet. To  as-
                 sume  a role, the fleet instance calls the AWS Security Token
                 Service (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN  of
                 the  role  to  use.  The operation creates a new session with
                 temporary credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the  temporary
                 credentials and creates the appstream_machine_role credential
                 profile on the instance.

                 For more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant  Permis-
                 sions  to  Applications  and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0

                 tion Guide .

              StreamView -> (string)
                 The  AppStream  2.0 view that is displayed to your users when
                 they stream from the fleet. When APP is specified,  only  the
                 windows of applications opened by users display. When DESKTOP
                 is specified, the standard desktop that is  provided  by  the
                 operating system displays.

                 The default value is APP .

              Platform -> (string)
                 The platform of the fleet.

              MaxConcurrentSessions -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of concurrent sessions for the fleet.

              UsbDeviceFilterStrings -> (list)
                 The USB device filter strings associated with the fleet.

                 (string)

              SessionScriptS3Location -> (structure)
                 The  S3  location  of  the  session scripts configuration zip
                 file. This only applies to Elastic fleets.

                 S3Bucket -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket of the S3 object.

                 S3Key -> (string)
                     The S3 key of the S3 object.

                     This is required when used for the following:
