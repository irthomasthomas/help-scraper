          streaming apps.
              ON_DEMAND

          Provide  users with access to applications after they connect, which
          takes one to two minutes. You are  charged  for  instance  streaming
          when  users  are connected and a small hourly fee for instances that
          are not streaming apps.

          Possible values:

          o ALWAYS_ON

          o ON_DEMAND

          o ELASTIC

       --compute-capacity (structure)
          The desired capacity for the fleet. This is not allowed for  Elastic
          fleets. For Elastic fleets, specify MaxConcurrentSessions instead.

          DesiredInstances -> (integer)
              The desired number of streaming instances.

          DesiredSessions -> (integer)
              The  desired  number of user sessions for a multi-session fleet.
              This is not allowed for single-session fleets.

              When you create a fleet, you must set either the DesiredSessions
              or  DesiredInstances  attribute,  based on the type of fleet you
              create. You cant define both attributes or leave both attributes
              blank.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DesiredInstances=integer,DesiredSessions=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DesiredInstances": integer,
            "DesiredSessions": integer
          }

       --vpc-config (structure)
          The  VPC  configuration  for the fleet. This is required for Elastic
          fleets, but not required for other fleet types. Elastic  fleets  re-
          quire  that you specify at least two subnets in different availabil-
          ity zones.

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              The identifiers of the subnets to which a network  interface  is
              attached  from  the  fleet  instance  or image builder instance.
              Fleet instances use one or more subnets. Image builder instances
              use one subnet.

              (string)

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The  identifiers  of  the security groups for the fleet or image
              builder.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetIds=string,string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --max-user-duration-in-seconds (integer)
          The maximum amount of time that a streaming session can  remain  ac-
          tive,  in  seconds.  If users are still connected to a streaming in-
          stance five minutes before this limit is reached, they are  prompted
          to  save  any  open  documents before being disconnected. After this
          time elapses, the instance is terminated and replaced by a  new  in-
          stance.

          Specify a value between 600 and 432000.

       --disconnect-timeout-in-seconds (integer)
          The  amount  of  time  that a streaming session remains active after
          users disconnect. If users try to reconnect to the streaming session
          after  a  disconnection or network interruption within this time in-
          terval, they are connected to  their  previous  session.  Otherwise,
          they are connected to a new session with a new streaming instance.

          Specify a value between 60 and 36000.

       --description (string)
          The description to display.

       --display-name (string)
          The fleet name to display.

       --enable-default-internet-access  | --no-enable-default-internet-access
       (boolean)
          Enables or disables default internet access for the fleet.

       --domain-join-info (structure)
          The name of the directory and organizational unit  (OU)  to  use  to
          join  the  fleet to a Microsoft Active Directory domain. This is not
          allowed for Elastic fleets.

          DirectoryName -> (string)
              The fully qualified name of the directory (for example, corp.ex-
              ample.com).

          OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName -> (string)
              The  distinguished  name of the organizational unit for computer
              accounts.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DirectoryName=string,OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DirectoryName": "string",
            "OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName": "string"
          }

       --tags (map)
          The tags to associate with the fleet. A tag is a key-value pair, and
          the  value is optional. For example, Environment=Test. If you do not
          specify a value, Environment=.

          If you do not specify a value, the value is set to an empty string.

          Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces  rep-
          resentable in UTF-8, and the following special characters:

          _ . : / = + - @

          For  more information, see Tagging Your Resources in the Amazon App-
          Stream 2.0 Administration Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --idle-disconnect-timeout-in-seconds (integer)
          The amount of time that users can be idle (inactive) before they are
          disconnected  from  their  streaming session and the DisconnectTime-
          outInSeconds time interval begins. Users are  notified  before  they
          are  disconnected due to inactivity. If they try to reconnect to the
          streaming session before the time interval specified in  Disconnect-
          TimeoutInSeconds  elapses, they are connected to their previous ses-
          sion. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or
          mouse  input  during their streaming session. File uploads and down-
          loads, audio in, audio out, and pixels changing do  not  qualify  as
          user  activity. If users continue to be idle after the time interval
          in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.

          To prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity,  specify
          a  value  of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and 36000. The
          default value is 0.

          NOTE:
              If you enable this feature, we  recommend  that  you  specify  a
              value that corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes (for
              example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don't do this, the  value  is
              rounded  to  the  nearest  minute. For example, if you specify a
              value of 70, users are disconnected after 1 minute  of  inactiv-
              ity.  If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between two
              different minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if  you
              specify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes of
              inactivity.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IAM  role  to  apply  to  the
          fleet. To assume a role, a fleet instance calls the AWS Security To-
          ken Service (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of the
          role to use. The operation creates a new session with temporary cre-
          dentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and cre-
          ates the appstream_machine_role credential profile on the instance.

          For  more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to
          Applications and Scripts Running  on  AppStream  2.0  Streaming  In-
          stances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .

       --stream-view (string)
          The  AppStream  2.0  view  that is displayed to your users when they
          stream from the fleet. When APP is specified, only  the  windows  of
          applications opened by users display. When DESKTOP is specified, the
          standard desktop that is provided by the operating system displays.

          The default value is APP .

          Possible values:

          o APP

          o DESKTOP

       --platform (string)
          The fleet platform. WINDOWS_SERVER_2019 and AMAZON_LINUX2  are  sup-
          ported for Elastic fleets.

          Possible values:

          o WINDOWS

          o WINDOWS_SERVER_2016

          o WINDOWS_SERVER_2019

          o WINDOWS_SERVER_2022

          o AMAZON_LINUX2

          o RHEL8

       --max-concurrent-sessions (integer)
          The  maximum  concurrent  sessions of the Elastic fleet. This is re-
          quired for Elastic fleets, and not allowed for other fleet types.

       --usb-device-filter-strings (list)
          The USB device filter strings that specify which USB devices a  user
          can  redirect to the fleet streaming session, when using the Windows
          native client. This is allowed but not required for Elastic fleets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --session-script-s3-location (structure)
          The S3 location of the session scripts configuration zip file.  This
          only applies to Elastic fleets.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The S3 bucket of the S3 object.

          S3Key -> (string)
              The S3 key of the S3 object.

              This is required when used for the following:

              o IconS3Location  (Actions: CreateApplication and UpdateApplica-
                tion)

              o SessionScriptS3Location (Actions: CreateFleet and UpdateFleet)

              o ScriptDetails (Actions: CreateAppBlock)

              o SourceS3Location when creating an app block with CUSTOM  Pack-
                agingType (Actions: CreateAppBlock)

              o SourceS3Location  when  creating  an app block with APPSTREAM2
                PackagingType, and using an existing application package  (VHD
                file).  In  this  case, S3Key refers to the VHD file. If a new
                application package is required, then S3Key is  not  required.
                (Actions: CreateAppBlock)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Key=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Key": "string"
          }

       --max-sessions-per-instance (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of user sessions on an instance. This only ap-
          plies to multi-session fleets.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

                 The total number of sessions slots that are either running or
                 pending.  This  represents  the  total  number  of concurrent
                 streaming sessions your fleet can support in a steady state.

                 DesiredUserSessionCapacity  =   ActualUserSessionCapacity   +
                 PendingUserSessionCapacity

                 The number of idle session slots currently available for user
                 sessions.

                 AvailableUserSessionCapacity  =  ActualUserSessionCapacity  -
                 ActiveUserSessions

                 The total number of session  slots  that  are  available  for
                 streaming or are currently streaming.

                 ActualUserSessionCapacity  =  AvailableUserSessionCapacity  +
                 ActiveUserSessions

                 This only applies to multi-session fleets.

          MaxUserDurationInSeconds -> (integer)
              The maximum amount of time that a streaming session  can  remain
              active,  in seconds. If users are still connected to a streaming
              instance five minutes before this limit  is  reached,  they  are
              prompted  to  save any open documents before being disconnected.
              After this time elapses, the instance is terminated and replaced
              by a new instance.

          DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              The amount of time that a streaming session remains active after
              users disconnect. If they try to reconnect to the streaming ses-
              sion  after  a disconnection or network interruption within this
              time interval, they are connected  to  their  previous  session.
              Otherwise,  they  are  connected  to  a  new  session with a new
              streaming instance.

              Specify a value between 60 and 36000.

          State -> (string)
              The current state for the fleet.

                 is  attached  from  the  fleet  instance or image builder in-
                 stance. Fleet  instances  use  one  or  more  subnets.  Image
                 builder instances use one subnet.

                 (string)

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The identifiers of the security groups for the fleet or image
                 builder.

              The time the fleet was created.

          FleetErrors -> (list)
              The fleet errors.

              (structure)
                 Describes a fleet error.

                 ErrorCode -> (string)
                     The error code.

                 ErrorMessage -> (string)
                     The error message.

          EnableDefaultInternetAccess -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether default internet access  is  enabled  for  the
              fleet.

          DomainJoinInfo -> (structure)
              The name of the directory and organizational unit (OU) to use to
              join the fleet to a Microsoft Active Directory domain.

              DirectoryName -> (string)
                 The fully qualified  name  of  the  directory  (for  example,
                 corp.example.com).

              OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName -> (string)
                 The  distinguished  name  of the organizational unit for com-
                 puter accounts.

          IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              The amount of time that users can be idle (inactive) before they
              are  disconnected  from  their streaming session and the Discon-
              nectTimeoutInSeconds time interval begins.  Users  are  notified
              before  they are disconnected due to inactivity. If users try to
              reconnect to the streaming  session  before  the  time  interval
              specified  in  DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are con-
              nected to their previous session. Users are considered idle when
              they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their stream-
              ing session. File uploads and downloads, audio  in,  audio  out,
              and  pixels  changing  do not qualify as user activity. If users
              continue to be idle after the time interval  in  IdleDisconnect-
              TimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.

              To  prevent  users  from  being  disconnected due to inactivity,
              specify a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60  and
              36000. The default value is 0.

              NOTE:
                 If  you  enable this feature, we recommend that you specify a
                 value that corresponds exactly to a whole number  of  minutes
                 (for  example,  60,  120, and 180). If you don't do this, the
                 value is rounded to the nearest minute. For example,  if  you
                 specify  a value of 70, users are disconnected after 1 minute
                 of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint
                 between  two  different minutes, the value is rounded up. For
                 example, if you specify a value of 90, users are disconnected
                 after 2 minutes of inactivity.

          IamRoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the fleet. To assume
              a role, the fleet instance calls the AWS Security Token  Service
              (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of the role to
              use. The operation creates a new session with temporary  creden-
              tials.  AppStream  2.0  retrieves  the temporary credentials and
              creates the appstream_machine_role credential profile on the in-
              stance.

              For more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions
              to Applications and Scripts Running on AppStream  2.0  Streaming
              Instances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .

          StreamView -> (string)
              The AppStream 2.0 view that is displayed to your users when they
              stream from the fleet. When APP is specified, only  the  windows
              of  applications opened by users display. When DESKTOP is speci-
              fied, the standard desktop that is  provided  by  the  operating
              system displays.

              The default value is APP .

          Platform -> (string)
              The platform of the fleet.

          MaxConcurrentSessions -> (integer)
              The maximum number of concurrent sessions for the fleet.

          UsbDeviceFilterStrings -> (list)
              The USB device filter strings associated with the fleet.

              (string)

          SessionScriptS3Location -> (structure)
              The  S3  location of the session scripts configuration zip file.
              This only applies to Elastic fleets.

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 The S3 bucket of the S3 object.

              S3Key -> (string)
                 The S3 key of the S3 object.

                 This is required when used for the following:

                 o IconS3Location (Actions: CreateApplication and UpdateAppli-
                   cation)

                 o SessionScriptS3Location  (Actions:  CreateFleet and Update-
                   Fleet)

                 o ScriptDetails (Actions: CreateAppBlock)

                 o SourceS3Location when creating an  app  block  with  CUSTOM
                   PackagingType (Actions: CreateAppBlock)

                 o SourceS3Location when creating an app block with APPSTREAM2
                   PackagingType, and using an  existing  application  package
                   (VHD  file). In this case, S3Key refers to the VHD file. If
                   a new application package is required, then  S3Key  is  not
                   required. (Actions: CreateAppBlock)

          MaxSessionsPerInstance -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number  of user sessions on an instance. This only
              applies to multi-session fleets.
