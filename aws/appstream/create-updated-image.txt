OPTIONS
       --existing-image-name (string)
          The name of the image to update.

       --new-image-name (string)
          The name of the new image. The name must be unique  within  the  AWS
          account and Region.

       --new-image-description (string)
          The description to display for the new image.

       --new-image-display-name (string)
          The name to display for the new image.

       --new-image-tags (map)
          The tags to associate with the new image. A tag is a key-value pair,
          and the value is optional. For example, Environment=Test. If you  do
          not specify a value, Environment=.

          Generally  allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces rep-
          resentable in UTF-8, and the following special characters:

          Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Indicates whether to display the status of image update availability
          before AppStream 2.0 initiates the process of creating a new updated
          image. If this value is set to true , AppStream 2.0 displays whether
          image updates are available. If this value is set to  false  ,  App-
          Stream  2.0  initiates  the  process of creating a new updated image
          without displaying whether image updates are available.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
