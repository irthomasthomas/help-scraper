CREATE-APPLICATION()                                      CREATE-APPLICATION()



NAME
       create-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an application.

       Applications  are  an Amazon AppStream 2.0 resource that stores the de-
       tails about how to launch applications on Elastic fleet  streaming  in-
       stances.  An application consists of the launch details, icon, and dis-
       play name. Applications are associated with an app block that  contains
       the  application binaries and other files. The applications assigned to
       an Elastic fleet are the applications users can launch.

       This is only supported for Elastic fleets.

       --name (string)
          The name of the application. This name is visible to users when dis-
          play name is not specified.

       --display-name (string)
          The  display  name of the application. This name is visible to users
          in the application catalog.

       --description (string)
          The description of the application.

       --icon-s3-location (structure)
          The location in S3 of the application icon.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The S3 bucket of the S3 object.

          S3Key -> (string)
              The S3 key of the S3 object.

              This is required when used for the following:

              o IconS3Location (Actions: CreateApplication and  UpdateApplica-
                tion)

              o SessionScriptS3Location (Actions: CreateFleet and UpdateFleet)

              o ScriptDetails (Actions: CreateAppBlock)

              o SourceS3Location  when creating an app block with CUSTOM Pack-
                agingType (Actions: CreateAppBlock)

              o SourceS3Location when creating an app  block  with  APPSTREAM2
                PackagingType,  and using an existing application package (VHD
                file). In this case, S3Key refers to the VHD file.  If  a  new
                application  package  is required, then S3Key is not required.
                (Actions: CreateAppBlock)

       Shorthand Syntax:

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            WINDOWS

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
