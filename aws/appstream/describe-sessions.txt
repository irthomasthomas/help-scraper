DESCRIBE-SESSIONS()                                        DESCRIBE-SESSIONS()



NAME
       describe-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a list that describes the streaming sessions for a specified
       stack and fleet. If a UserId is provided for the stack and fleet,  only
       streaming  sessions  for  that user are described. If an authentication
       type is not provided, the default is  to  authenticate  users  using  a
       streaming URL.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-sessions  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Sessions

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack. This value is case-sensitive.

       --fleet-name (string)
          The name of the fleet. This value is case-sensitive.

       --user-id (string)
          The user identifier (ID). If you specify a user ID,  you  must  also
          specify the authentication type.

       --authentication-type (string)
          The  authentication method. Specify API for a user authenticated us-
          ing a streaming URL or SAML for a SAML federated user.  The  default
          is to authenticate users using a streaming URL.

          Possible values:

          o API

          o SAML

          o USERPOOL

          o AWS_AD

       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier for the instance hosting the session.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Sessions -> (list)
          Information about the streaming sessions.

          (structure)
              Describes a streaming session.

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the streaming session.

              UserId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the user for whom the session was created.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The name of the stack for the streaming session.

              FleetName -> (string)
                 The name of the fleet for the streaming session.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the streaming session.

              ConnectionState -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  a user is connected to the streaming ses-
                 sion.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when a streaming instance is dedicated for the user.

              MaxExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the streaming session is set  to  expire.  This
                 time  is  based  on the MaxUserDurationinSeconds value, which
                 determines the maximum length of time that a  streaming  ses-
                 sion  can run. A streaming session might end earlier than the
                 time specified in SessionMaxExpirationTime , when the Discon-
                 nectTimeOutInSeconds  elapses  or the user chooses to end his
                 or her session. If the DisconnectTimeOutInSeconds elapses, or
                 the user chooses to end his or her session, the streaming in-
                 stance is terminated and the streaming session ends.

              AuthenticationType -> (string)
                 The authentication method. The user is authenticated using  a
                 streaming URL (API ) or SAML 2.0 federation (SAML ).

              NetworkAccessConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The network details for the streaming session.

                 EniPrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                     The  private  IP address of the elastic network interface
                     that is attached to instances in your VPC.

                 EniId -> (string)
                     The resource identifier of the elastic network  interface
                     that  is  attached  to instances in your VPC. All network
                     interfaces have the eni-xxxxxxxx resource identifier.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the instance hosting the session.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
