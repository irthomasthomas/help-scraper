OPTIONS
       --user-stack-associations (list)
          The list of UserStackAssociation objects.

          (structure)
              Describes a user in the user pool and the associated stack.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The name of the stack that is associated with the user.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The  email  address  of  the  user who is associated with the
                 stack.

                 NOTE:
                     Users' email addresses are case-sensitive.

              AuthenticationType -> (string)
                 The authentication type for the user.

              SendEmailNotification -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether a welcome email is sent to a user after the
                 user is created in the user pool.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StackName=string,UserName=string,AuthenticationType=string,SendEmailNotification=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "StackName": "string",
              "UserName": "string",
              "AuthenticationType": "API"|"SAML"|"USERPOOL"|"AWS_AD",
              "SendEmailNotification": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)
