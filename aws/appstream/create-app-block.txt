CREATE-APP-BLOCK()                                          CREATE-APP-BLOCK()



NAME
       create-app-block -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an app block.

       App blocks are an Amazon AppStream 2.0 resource that stores the details
       about the virtual hard disk in an S3 bucket. It also stores  the  setup
       script  with details about how to mount the virtual hard disk. The vir-
       tual hard disk includes the application binaries and other files neces-
       sary to launch your applications. Multiple applications can be assigned
       to a single app block.

       This is only supported for Elastic fleets.

       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
