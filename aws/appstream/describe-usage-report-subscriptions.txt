OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of each page of results.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If this value is null, it retrieves the first page.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       UsageReportSubscriptions -> (list)
          Information about the usage report subscription.

          (structure)
              Describes information about the usage report subscription.

              S3BucketName -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket where generated reports are stored.

                 If you enabled on-instance session scripts and Amazon S3 log-
                 ging  for  your  session  script configuration, AppStream 2.0
                 created an S3 bucket to store the script output.  The  bucket
                 is  unique  to your account and Region. When you enable usage
                 reporting in this case, AppStream 2.0 uses the same bucket to
                 store  your  usage  reports.  If  you haven't already enabled
                 on-instance session scripts, when you enable  usage  reports,
                 AppStream 2.0 creates a new S3 bucket.

              Schedule -> (string)
                 The schedule for generating usage reports.

              LastGeneratedReportDate -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the last usage report was generated.

              SubscriptionErrors -> (list)
                 The  errors  that  were returned if usage reports couldn't be
                 generated.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the error that is returned when a usage  report
                     can't be generated.

                     ErrorCode -> (string)
                        The  error  code for the error that is returned when a
                        usage report can't be generated.

                     ErrorMessage -> (string)
                        The error message for the error that is returned  when
                        a usage report can't be generated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
