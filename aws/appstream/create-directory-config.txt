OPTIONS
       --directory-name (string)
          The  fully  qualified name of the directory (for example, corp.exam-
          ple.com).

       --organizational-unit-distinguished-names (list)
          The distinguished names of the organizational units for computer ac-
          counts.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --service-account-credentials (structure)
          The  credentials  for the service account used by the fleet or image
          builder to connect to the directory.

          AccountName -> (string)
              The user name of the account. This account must have the follow-
              ing  privileges:  create computer objects, join computers to the
              domain, and change/reset the password on descendant computer ob-
              jects for the organizational units specified.

          AccountPassword -> (string)
              The password for the account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountName=string,AccountPassword=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountName": "string",
            "AccountPassword": "string"
          }

       --certificate-based-auth-properties (structure)
          The certificate-based authentication properties used to authenticate
          SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) user identities to Active Directory
          domain-joined  streaming instances. Fallback is turned on by default
          when certificate-based authentication is Enabled .  Fallback  allows
          users  to log in using their AD domain password if certificate-based
          authentication is unsuccessful, or to unlock a desktop lock  screen.
          Enabled_no_directory_login_fallback  enables  certificate-based  au-
          thentication, but does not allow users to log in using their AD  do-
          main  password.  Users will be disconnected to re-authenticate using
          certificates.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the certificate-based authentication properties.

          CertificateAuthorityArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the AWS Certificate Manager Private CA resource.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Status=string,CertificateAuthorityArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Status": "DISABLED"|"ENABLED"|"ENABLED_NO_DIRECTORY_LOGIN_FALLBACK",
            "CertificateAuthorityArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

          Information about the directory configuration.

          DirectoryName -> (string)
              The fully qualified name of the directory (for example, corp.ex-
              ample.com).

          OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedNames -> (list)

          ServiceAccountCredentials -> (structure)
              The credentials for the service account used by the fleet or im-
              age builder to connect to the directory.

              AccountName -> (string)
                 The user name of the account. This account must have the fol-
                 lowing privileges: create computer objects, join computers to
                 the domain, and change/reset the password on descendant  com-
                 puter objects for the organizational units specified.

              AccountPassword -> (string)
                 The password for the account.

          CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the directory configuration was created.

          CertificateBasedAuthProperties -> (structure)
              The  certificate-based authentication properties used to authen-
              ticate SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) user identities  to  Ac-
              tive  Directory  domain-joined  streaming instances. Fallback is
              turned on by default when  certificate-based  authentication  is
              Enabled  . Fallback allows users to log in using their AD domain
              password if certificate-based authentication is unsuccessful, or
              to   unlock  a  desktop  lock  screen.  Enabled_no_directory_lo-
              gin_fallback enables certificate-based authentication, but  does
              not  allow users to log in using their AD domain password. Users
              will be disconnected to re-authenticate using certificates.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the  certificate-based  authentication  proper-
                 ties.

              CertificateAuthorityArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the AWS Certificate Manager Private CA resource.
