DESCRIBE-STACKS()                                            DESCRIBE-STACKS()



NAME
       describe-stacks -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  that describes one or more specified stacks, if the
       stack names are provided. Otherwise, all stacks in the account are  de-
       scribed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-stacks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Stacks

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          The names of the stacks to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                     application settings are stored.

                 S3BucketName -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket where users persistent application settings
                     are stored. When persistent application settings are  en-
                     abled for the first time for an account in an AWS Region,
                     an S3 bucket is created. The bucket is unique to the  AWS
                     account and the Region.

              AccessEndpoints -> (list)
                 The  list  of  virtual private cloud (VPC) interface endpoint
                 objects. Users of the stack can connect to AppStream 2.0 only
                 through the specified endpoints.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  an interface VPC endpoint (interface endpoint)
                     that lets you create a  private  connection  between  the
                     virtual  private  cloud  (VPC)  that you specify and App-
                     Stream 2.0. When you specify an interface endpoint for  a
                     stack,  users  of  the stack can connect to AppStream 2.0
                     only through that endpoint. When you specify an interface
                     endpoint for an image builder, administrators can connect
                     to the image builder only through that endpoint.

                     EndpointType -> (string)
                        The type of interface endpoint.

                     VpceId -> (string)
                        The identifier (ID) of the VPC in which the  interface
                        endpoint is used.

              EmbedHostDomains -> (list)
                 The domains where AppStream 2.0 streaming sessions can be em-
                 bedded in an iframe. You must approve the  domains  that  you
                 want to host embedded AppStream 2.0 streaming sessions.

                 (string)
                     Specifies  a valid domain that can embed AppStream. Valid
                     examples  include:  ["testorigin.tt--com",   "testingori-
                     gin.com.us",  "test.com.us"]  Invalid  examples  include:
                     ["test,com", ".com", "h*llo.com". ""]

              StreamingExperienceSettings -> (structure)
                 The streaming protocol you want your stack  to  prefer.  This
                 can  be  UDP  or TCP. Currently, UDP is only supported in the
                 Windows native client.

                 PreferredProtocol -> (string)
                     The preferred protocol that you want to use while stream-
                     ing your application.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
