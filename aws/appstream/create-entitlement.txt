CREATE-ENTITLEMENT()                                      CREATE-ENTITLEMENT()



NAME
       create-entitlement -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new entitlement. Entitlements control access to specific ap-
       plications within a stack, based on user attributes. Entitlements apply
       to  SAML  2.0 federated user identities. Amazon AppStream 2.0 user pool
       and streaming URL users are entitled to all applications  in  a  stack.
       Entitlements  don't apply to the desktop stream view application, or to
       applications managed by a dynamic app provider using the Dynamic Appli-
       cation Framework.

          (structure)
              An  attribute  associated with an entitlement. Application enti-
              tlements work by matching a supported SAML 2.0 attribute name to
              a  value  when  a user identity federates to an Amazon AppStream
              2.0 SAML application.

              Name -> (string)
                 A supported AWS  IAM  SAML  PrincipalTag  attribute  that  is
                 matched  to  the associated value when a user identity feder-
                 ates into an Amazon AppStream 2.0 SAML application.

                 The following are valid values:

                 o roles

                 o department

                 o organization

                 o groups

                 o title

                 o userType

              Value -> (string)
                 A value that is matched to a supported  SAML  attribute  name

                 SAML application.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
