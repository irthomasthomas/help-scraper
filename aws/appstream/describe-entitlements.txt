OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the entitlement.

       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack with which the entitlement is associated.

       --next-token (string)
          The  pagination  token used to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of each page of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Entitlements -> (list)
          The entitlements.

          (structure)
              Specifies an entitlement. Entitlements control  access  to  spe-
              cific applications within a stack, based on user attributes. En-
              titlements apply to SAML 2.0 federated user  identities.  Amazon
              AppStream  2.0 user pool and streaming URL users are entitled to
              all applications in a stack. Entitlements  don't  apply  to  the
              desktop stream view application, or to applications managed by a
              dynamic app provider using the Dynamic Application Framework.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the entitlement.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The name of the stack with which the entitlement  is  associ-
                 ated.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the entitlement.

              AppVisibility -> (string)
                 Specifies whether all or selected apps are entitled.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 The attributes of the entitlement.

                 (structure)
                     An  attribute associated with an entitlement. Application
                     entitlements work by matching a supported SAML 2.0 attri-
                     bute name to a value when a user identity federates to an
                     Amazon AppStream 2.0 SAML application.

                     Name -> (string)
                        A supported AWS IAM SAML PrincipalTag  attribute  that
                        is  matched  to the associated value when a user iden-
                        tity federates into an Amazon AppStream 2.0  SAML  ap-
                        plication.

                        The following are valid values:

                        o roles

                        o title

                        o costCenter

                        o userType

                     Value -> (string)
                        A  value that is matched to a supported SAML attribute
                        name when a user identity  federates  into  an  Amazon
                        AppStream 2.0 SAML application.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the entitlement was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the entitlement was last modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination  token used to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation.
