DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          Amazon  Security  Lake is in preview release. Your use of the Amazon
          Security Lake preview is subject to Section 2 of the Amazon Web Ser-

       Amazon Security Lake is a fully-managed security data lake service. You
       can use Security Lake to automatically centralize  security  data  from
       cloud,  on-premises,  and custom sources into a data lake that's stored
       in your account. Security Lake helps you analyze security data, so  you
       can  get  a more complete understanding of your security posture across
       the entire organization and improve the protection of  your  workloads,
       applications, and data.

       The  data  lake  is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
       buckets, and you retain ownership over your data.

       Security Lake automates the  collection  of  security-related  log  and
       event  data  from  integrated Amazon Web Services. and third-party ser-
       vices and manages the lifecycle of data with customizable retention and
       replication  settings.  Security  Lake also converts ingested data into
       Apache Parquet format and a standard open-source schema called the Open
       Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF).

       Other Amazon Web Services and third-party services can subscribe to the
       data that's stored in Security Lake for incident response and  security
       data analytics.
