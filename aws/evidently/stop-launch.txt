STOP-LAUNCH()                                                    STOP-LAUNCH()



NAME
       stop-launch -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops  a launch that is currently running. After you stop a launch, you
       will not be able to resume it or restart it. Also, it will not be eval-
       uated  as a rule for traffic allocation, and the traffic that was allo-
       cated to the launch will instead be available to the feature's  experi-
       ment,  if  there  is one. Otherwise, all traffic will be served the de-
       fault variation after the launch is stopped.

OPTIONS
       --desired-state (string)
          Specify whether to consider the launch as COMPLETED or CANCELLED af-
          ter it stops.

          Possible values:

          o COMPLETED

          o CANCELLED

       --launch (string)
          The name of the launch to stop.

       --project (string)
          The  name  or  ARN  of the project that contains the launch that you
          want to stop.

       --reason (string)
          A string that describes why you are stopping the launch.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
