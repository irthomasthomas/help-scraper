CREATE-SEGMENT()                                              CREATE-SEGMENT()



NAME
       create-segment -

DESCRIPTION
       Use this operation to define a segment of your audience. A segment is a
       portion of your audience that share one or more characteristics.  Exam-
       ples could be Chrome browser users, users in Europe, or Firefox browser
       users in Europe who also fit other criteria that your application  col-
       lects, such as age.

       Using  a  segment  in  an experiment limits that experiment to evaluate
       only the users who match the segment criteria. Using one or  more  seg-
       ments  in a launch allow you to define different traffic splits for the
       different audience segments.
          <p>For  more  information  about  segment  pattern  syntax,  see  <a
          href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitor-
          ing/CloudWatch-Evidently-segments-syntax.html"> Segment rule pattern
          syntax</a>.</p>  <p>The  pattern  that  you  define for a segment is
          matched against the value of  <code>evaluationContext</code>,  which
          is  passed  into  Evidently  in  the  <a href="https://docs.aws.ama-
          zon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_EvaluateFea-
          ture.html">EvaluateFeature</a>  operation,  when Evidently assigns a
          feature variation to a user.</p>

SYNOPSIS
            create-segment
          [--description <value>]
          --name <value>
          --pattern <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          An optional description for this segment.

       --name (string)
          A name for the segment.

       --pattern (string)
          The pattern to use for the segment. For more information about  pat-
          tern syntax, see Segment rule pattern syntax .

       --tags (map)
          Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the segment.

          Tags  can  help  you organize and categorize your resources. You can
          also use them to scope user permissions by granting a  user  permis-
          sion to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

          Tags  don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are
          interpreted strictly as strings of characters.
              <p>You can associate as many as  50  tags  with  a  segment.</p>

              zon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging  Amazon  Web
              Services resources</a>.</p> key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       segment -> (structure)
          A structure that contains the complete information about the segment
          that was just created.

          arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the segment.

          createdTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that this segment was created.

          description -> (string)
              The customer-created description for this segment.

          experimentCount -> (long)
              The  number  of  experiments  that this segment is used in. This
              count includes all current experiments, not just those that  are
              currently running.

          lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that this segment was most recently updated.

          launchCount -> (long)
              The  number of launches that this segment is used in. This count
              includes all current launches, not just those that are currently
              running.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the segment.

          pattern -> (string)

          tags -> (map)
              The list of tag keys and values associated with this launch.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
