CREATE-SEGMENT()                                              CREATE-SEGMENT()



NAME
       create-segment -

DESCRIPTION
       Use this operation to define a segment of your audience. A segment is a
       portion of your audience that share one or more characteristics.  Exam-
       ples could be Chrome browser users, users in Europe, or Firefox browser
       users in Europe who also fit other criteria that your application  col-
       lects, such as age.

       Using  a  segment  in  an experiment limits that experiment to evaluate
       only the users who match the segment criteria. Using one or  more  seg-
       ments in a launch allows you to define different traffic splits for the
       different audience segments.

       For more information about segment pattern  syntax,  see  Segment  rule
       pattern syntax .

       The  pattern that you define for a segment is matched against the value
       of  evaluationContext  ,  which  is  passed  into  Evidently   in   the
       EvaluateFeature  operation,  when Evidently assigns a feature variation
       to a user.

          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          An optional description for this segment.

       --name (string)
          A name for the segment.

       --pattern (string)
          The pattern to use for the segment. For more information about  pat-
          tern syntax, see Segment rule pattern syntax .

       --tags (map)
          Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the segment.

          Tags  can  help  you organize and categorize your resources. You can
          also use them to scope user permissions by granting a  user  permis-
          sion to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

          Tags  don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are
          interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

          You can associate as many as 50 tags with a segment.

          For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services resources .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       segment -> (structure)
          A structure that contains the complete information about the segment
          that was just created.

              running.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the segment.

          pattern -> (string)
