LIST-SEGMENTS()                                                LIST-SEGMENTS()



NAME
       list-segments -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of audience segments that you have created in your ac-
       count in this Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-segments is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: segments

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use in a subsequent ListSegments  operation  to  return
          the next set of results.

       segments -> (list)
          An  array  of structures that contain information about the segments
          in this Region.

          (structure)
              This structure contains information about one audience segment .
              You  can use segments in your experiments and launches to narrow
              the user sessions used for experiment or launch to only the user
              sessions that match one or more criteria.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the segment.

              createdTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that this segment was created.

              description -> (string)
                 The customer-created description for this segment.

              experimentCount -> (long)
                 The  number of experiments that this segment is used in. This
                 count includes all current experiments, not just  those  that
                 are currently running.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)

                 dated.

              launchCount -> (long)
                 The number of launches that this segment  is  used  in.  This
                 count  includes all current launches, not just those that are
                 currently running.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the segment.

              pattern -> (string)
                 The pattern that defines the attributes  to  use  to  evalute
                 whether  a  user session will be in the segment. For more in-
                 formation about the pattern syntax, see Segment rule  pattern
                 syntax .

              tags -> (map)
                 The list of tag keys and values associated with this launch.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
