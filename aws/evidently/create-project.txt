DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  project,  which is the logical object in Evidently that can
       contain features, launches, and experiments. Use projects to group sim-
       ilar features together.

       To update an existing project, use UpdateProject .

OPTIONS
       --data-delivery (structure)
          A  structure  that  contains information about where Evidently is to
          store evaluation events for longer term storage, if you choose to do
          so.  If you choose not to store these events, Evidently deletes them
          after using them to produce metrics  and  other  experiment  results
          that you can view.

          cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
              If the project stores evaluation events in CloudWatch Logs, this
              structure stores the log group name.

              logGroup -> (string)
                 The name of the log group where the project stores evaluation
                 events.

          s3Destination -> (structure)
              If  the project stores evaluation events in an Amazon S3 bucket,
              this structure stores the bucket name and bucket prefix.

              bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket in which Evidently  stores  evaluation
                 events.

              prefix -> (string)
                 The  bucket  prefix  in  which  Evidently  stores  evaluation
                 events.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cloudWatchLogs={logGroup=string},s3Destination={bucket=string,prefix=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "cloudWatchLogs": {
              "logGroup": "string"
            },
            "s3Destination": {
              "bucket": "string",
              "prefix": "string"
            }
          }

       --description (string)
          An optional description of the project.

       --name (string)
          The name for the project.

       --tags (map)
          Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the project.

          Tags can help you organize and categorize your  resources.  You  can
          also  use  them to scope user permissions by granting a user permis-
          sion to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

          Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and  are
          interpreted strictly as strings of characters.
              <p>You  can  associate  as  many  as 50 tags with a project.</p>

              zon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging  Amazon  Web
              Services resources</a>.</p> key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
