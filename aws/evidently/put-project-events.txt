OPTIONS
       --events (list)
          An array of event structures that contain the performance data  that
          is being sent to Evidently.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that contains the information about one evaluation
              event or custom event sent to Evidently. This is a JSON payload.
              If  this  event  specifies a pre-defined event type, the payload
              must follow the defined event schema.

              data -> (string)
                 The event data.

              timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the event.

              type -> (string)
                 aws.evidently.evaluation specifies an evaluation event, which
                 determines which feature variation that a user sees. aws.evi-
                 dently.custom specifies a custom event, which generates  met-
                 rics from user actions such as clicks and checkouts.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          data=string,timestamp=timestamp,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "data": "string",
              "timestamp": timestamp,
              "type": "aws.evidently.evaluation"|"aws.evidently.custom"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project to write the events to.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       eventResults -> (list)
          A  structure  that contains Evidently's response to the sent events,
          including an event ID and error codes, if any.

          (structure)
              A structure that  contains  Evidently's  response  to  the  sent
              events, including an event ID and error codes, if any.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 If  the  PutProjectEvents  operation  has an error, the error
                 code is returned here.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 If the PutProjectEvents operation has  an  error,  the  error
                 message is returned here.

              eventId -> (string)
                 A unique ID assigned to this PutProjectEvents operation.

       failedEventCount -> (integer)
          The number of events in the operation that could not be used by Evi-
          dently.
