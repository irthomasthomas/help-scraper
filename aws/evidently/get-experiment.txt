OPTIONS
       --experiment (string)
          The name of the experiment that you want to see the details of.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that contains the experiment.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                     INCREASE means that a variation with a higher number  for
                     this metric is performing better.

                     DECREASE  means  that a variation with a lower number for
                     this metric is performing better.

                        For more information about EventBridge event patterns,
                        see Amazon EventBridge event patterns .

                     unitLabel -> (string)
                        The label for the units that the metric is measuring.

                     valueKey -> (string)
                        The value that is tracked to produce the metric.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the experiment.

          onlineAbDefinition -> (structure)
              A  structure  that contains the configuration of which variation
              to use as the "control" version. The "control" version  is  used
              for comparison with other variations. This structure also speci-
              fies how much experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.

              controlTreatmentName -> (string)
                 The name of the variation that is the default variation  that
                 the other variations are compared to.

              treatmentWeights -> (map)
                 A  set  of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names, and
                 the values are the portion of experiment traffic  to  be  as-
                 signed to that variation. The traffic portion is specified in
                 thousandths of a percent, so 20,000 for a variation would al-
                 locate 20% of the experiment traffic to that variation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (long)

          project -> (string)
              The name or ARN of the project that contains this experiment.

          randomizationSalt -> (string)
              This value is used when Evidently assigns a particular user ses-
              sion to the experiment. It helps create a  randomization  ID  to
              determine  which variation the user session is served. This ran-
              domization ID is a combination of the entity ID  and  randomiza-
              tionSalt .

          samplingRate -> (long)
              In  thousandths  of a percent, the amount of the available audi-
              ence that is allocated to this experiment. The  available  audi-
              ence  is the total audience minus the audience that you have al-
              located to overrides or current launches of this feature.

              This is represented in thousandths of a percent, so a  value  of
              10,000 is 10% of the available audience.

          schedule -> (structure)
              A  structure that contains the time and date that Evidently com-
              pleted the analysis of the experiment.

              analysisCompleteTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time and date that Evidently completed  the  analysis  of
                 the experiment.

          segment -> (string)
              The audience segment being used for the experiment, if a segment
              is being used.

          status -> (string)
              The current state of the experiment.

          statusReason -> (string)
              If the experiment was stopped, this is the string that  was  en-
              tered  by  the person who stopped the experiment, to explain why
              it was stopped.

          tags -> (map)
              The list of tag keys and values associated with this experiment.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          treatments -> (list)
              An array of structures that describe the configuration  of  each
              feature variation used in the experiment.

              (structure)
                 A  structure  that  defines one treatment in an experiment. A
                 treatment is a variation of the feature that you are  includ-
                 ing in the experiment.

                 description -> (string)
                     The description of the treatment.

                 featureVariations -> (map)
                     The  feature variation used for this treatment. This is a
                     key-value pair. The key is  the  feature  name,  and  the
                     value is the variation name.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of this treatment.

          type -> (string)
              The  type  of  this  experiment.  Currently,  this value must be
              aws.experiment.onlineab .
