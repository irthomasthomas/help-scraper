CREATE-EXPERIMENT()                                        CREATE-EXPERIMENT()



NAME
       create-experiment -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an Evidently experiment . Before you create an experiment, you
       must create the feature to use for the experiment.

       An experiment helps you make feature design decisions based on evidence
       and  data.  An  experiment can test as many as five variations at once.
       Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it by statistical meth-
       ods,  and provides clear recommendations about which variations perform
       better.

       You can optionally specify a segment to have  the  experiment  consider
       only  certain audience types in the experiment, such as using only user
       sessions from a certain location or who use a certain internet browser.

       Don't use this operation to update an existing experiment. Instead, use
       UpdateExperiment .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          desiredChange=string,metricDefinition={entityIdKey=string,eventPattern=string,name=string,unitLabel=string,valueKey=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

                "unitLabel": "string",
                "valueKey": "string"
              }

       --name (string)
          A name for the new experiment.

       --online-ab-config (structure)
          A structure that contains the configuration of  which  variation  to
          use  as  the  "control"  version. tThe "control" version is used for
          comparison with other variations. This structure also specifies  how
          much experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.

          controlTreatmentName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the variation that is to be the default variation
              that the other variations are compared to.

          treatmentWeights -> (map)
              A set of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names, and  the
              values  are  the portion of experiment traffic to be assigned to
              that variation. Specify the traffic portion in thousandths of  a
              percent, so 20,000 for a variation would allocate 20% of the ex-
              periment traffic to that variation.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (long)

          periment in.

       --randomization-salt (string)
          When  Evidently  assigns a particular user session to an experiment,
          it must use a randomization ID to determine which variation the user
          session is served. This randomization ID is a combination of the en-
          tity ID and randomizationSalt . If you omit randomizationSalt , Evi-
          dently uses the experiment name as the randomizationSalt .

       --sampling-rate (long)
          The  portion  of the available audience that you want to allocate to
          this experiment, in thousandths of a percent. The available audience
          is  the total audience minus the audience that you have allocated to
          overrides or current launches of this feature.

          This is represented in thousandths of a percent. For example,  spec-
          ify 10,000 to allocate 10% of the available audience.

       --segment (string)
          Specifies  an audience segment to use in the experiment. When a seg-
          ment is used in an experiment, only user  sessions  that  match  the
          segment pattern are used in the experiment.

       --tags (map)
          Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the experiment.

          Tags  can  help  you organize and categorize your resources. You can
          also use them to scope user permissions by granting a  user  permis-
          sion to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

          Tags  don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are
          interpreted strictly as strings of characters.
              <p>You can associate as many as 50 tags with an  experiment.</p>

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 A set of key-value pairs. The keys are variation  names,  and
                 the  values  are  the portion of experiment traffic to be as-
                 signed to that variation. The traffic portion is specified in
                 thousandths of a percent, so 20,000 for a variation would al-

              This value is used when Evidently assigns a particular user ses-
              sion  to  the  experiment. It helps create a randomization ID to
              determine which variation the user session is served. This  ran-
              domization  ID  is a combination of the entity ID and randomiza-
              tionSalt .

          samplingRate -> (long)
              In thousandths of a percent, the amount of the  available  audi-
              ence  that  is allocated to this experiment. The available audi-
              ence is the total audience minus the audience that you have  al-
              located to overrides or current launches of this feature.

              This  is  represented in thousandths of a percent, so a value of

              The current state of the experiment.

          statusReason -> (string)
              If  the  experiment was stopped, this is the string that was en-
              tered by the person who stopped the experiment, to  explain  why
              it was stopped.

          tags -> (map)
              The list of tag keys and values associated with this experiment.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
