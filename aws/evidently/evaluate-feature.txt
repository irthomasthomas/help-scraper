EVALUATE-FEATURE()                                          EVALUATE-FEATURE()



NAME
       evaluate-feature -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  assigns a feature variation to one given user session.
       You pass in an entityID that represents the user. Evidently then checks
       the evaluation rules and assigns the variation.

       The  first  rules  that  are  evaluated  are the override rules. If the
       user's entityID matches an override rule, the user is served the varia-
       tion specified by that rule.
          <p>If  there is a current launch with this feature that uses segment
          overrides, and if the user session's  <code>evaluationContext</code>
          matches a segment rule defined in a segment override, the configura-
          tion in the segment overrides is used. For  more  information  about
          segments,  see  <a  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevi-
          dently/latest/APIReference/API_CreateSegment.html">CreateSegment</a>
          and    <a    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/lat-
          est/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-segments.html">Use  segments  to
          focus your audience</a>.</p> <p>If there is a launch with no segment
          overrides, the user might be assigned to a variation in the  launch.
          The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are allo-
          cated to that launch. If the user is enrolled  in  the  launch,  the
          variation  they  are served depends on the allocation of the various
          feature variations used for the launch.</p> <p>If the  user  is  not
          assigned  to  a  launch, and there is an ongoing experiment for this
          feature, the user might be assigned to a variation  in  the  experi-
          ment. The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are
          allocated to that experiment.</p> <p>If the experiment uses  a  seg-
          ment,  then  only  user sessions with <code>evaluationContext</code>
          values that match the segment rule are used in  the  experiment.</p>
          <p>If the user is enrolled in the experiment, the variation they are
          served depends on the allocation of the various  feature  variations
          used  for  the  experiment. </p> <p>If the user is not assigned to a
          launch or experiment, they are served the default variation.</p>

OPTIONS
       --entity-id (string)
          An internal ID that represents a unique  user  of  the  application.
          This  entityID  is  checked  against any override rules assigned for
          this feature.

       --evaluation-context (string)
          A JSON object of attributes that you can optionally pass in as  part
          of the evaluation event sent to Evidently from the user session. Ev-
          idently can use this value to match user sessions with defined audi-
          ence  segments. For more information, see Use segments to focus your
          audience .
              <p>If you include this parameter, the value must be a  JSON  ob-
              ject. A JSON array is not supported.</p>

       --feature (string)
          The name of the feature being evaluated.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that contains this feature.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       details -> (string)

       reason -> (string)
          Specifies  the reason that the user session was assigned this varia-
          tion. Possible values include DEFAULT , meaning the user was  served
          the  default  variation; LAUNCH_RULE_MATCH , if the user session was
          enrolled in a launch; EXPERIMENT_RULE_MATCH , if  the  user  session
          was  enrolled  in  an experiment; or ENTITY_OVERRIDES_MATCH , if the
          user's entityId matches an override rule.

       value -> (structure)
          The value assigned to this variation to differentiate  it  from  the
          other variations of this feature.

          boolValue -> (boolean)
              If this feature uses the Boolean variation type, this field con-
              tains the Boolean value of this variation.

          doubleValue -> (double)
              If this feature uses the double  integer  variation  type,  this
              field contains the double integer value of this variation.

              If this feature uses the string variation type, this field  con-
              tains the string value of this variation.

       variation -> (string)
          The name of the variation that was served to the user session.
