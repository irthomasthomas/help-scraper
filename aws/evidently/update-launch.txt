          monitor the launch performance.

          (structure)
              A structure that defines a metric to be used to monitor  perfor-
              mance of the variations during a launch.

              metricDefinition -> (structure)
                 A structure that defines the metric.

                 entityIdKey -> (string)

                     tion that causes a metric value to be recorded. An  exam-
                     ple is userDetails.userID .

                 eventPattern -> (string)
                     The EventBridge event pattern that defines how the metric
                     is recorded.

                     For more information about  EventBridge  event  patterns,
                     see Amazon EventBridge event patterns .

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "metricDefinition": {
                "entityIdKey": "string",
                "eventPattern": "string",

            ...
          ]

       --project (string)
          The  name  or  ARN  of the project that contains the launch that you
          want to update.

       --randomization-salt (string)
          When Evidently assigns a particular user session  to  a  launch,  it
          must  use  a  randomization ID to determine which variation the user
          session is served. This randomization ID is a combination of the en-
          tity ID and randomizationSalt . If you omit randomizationSalt , Evi-
          dently uses the launch name as the randomizationSalt .

       --scheduled-splits-config (structure)
          An array of structures that define the traffic  allocation  percent-
          ages among the feature variations during each step of the launch.

          steps -> (list)
              An  array  of structures that define the traffic allocation per-
              centages among the feature variations during each  step  of  the
              launch. This also defines the start time of each step.

              (structure)
                 This  structure  defines  the  traffic allocation percentages
                 among the feature variations during one step of a launch, and
                 the start time of that step.

                 groupWeights -> (map)
                     The  traffic  allocation  percentages  among  the feature
                     variations during one step of a launch. This is a set  of
                     key-value pairs. The keys are variation names. The values
                     represent the percentage of traffic to allocate  to  that
                     variation during this step.

                     The  values  is expressed in thousandths of a percent, so
                     assigning a weight of 50000 assigns  50%  of  traffic  to
                     that variation.

                     If  the  sum  of  the weights for all the variations in a
                     segment override does not add up to 100,000, then the re-
                     maining traffic that matches this segment is not assigned
                     by this segment override, and instead  moves  on  to  the
                     next segment override or the default traffic split.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (long)

                 segmentOverrides -> (list)
                     Use  this  parameter  to specify different traffic splits
                     for one or more audience segments . A segment is  a  por-
                     tion of your audience that share one or more characteris-
                     tics. Examples could be Chrome browser  users,  users  in
                     Europe,  or  Firefox browser users in Europe who also fit
                     other criteria that your application  collects,  such  as
                     age.

                     This  parameter is an array of up to six segment override
                     objects. Each of these objects specifies a  segment  that
                     you  have  already created, and defines the traffic split
                     for that segment.

                     (structure)
                        This structure specifies a segment that you  have  al-
                        ready  created, and defines the traffic split for that
                        segment to be used in a launch.

                        evaluationOrder -> (long)
                            A number indicating the order to use  to  evaluate
                            segment  overrides,  if  there  are more than one.
                            Segment overrides with lower numbers are evaluated
                            first.

                        segment -> (string)
                            The ARN of the segment to use.

                        weights -> (map)
                            The  traffic allocation percentages among the fea-
                            ture variations to assign to this segment. This is
                            a  set  of key-value pairs. The keys are variation
                            names. The values represent the amount of  traffic
                            to  allocate  to  that variation for this segment.
                            This is expressed in thousandths of a percent,  so
                            a weight of 50000 represents 50% of traffic.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (long)

                 startTime -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time that this step of the launch starts.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          randomizationSalt -> (string)
              This value is used when Evidently assigns a particular user ses-
              sion  to the launch, to help create a randomization ID to deter-
              mine which variation the user session is served. This randomiza-
              tion  ID is a combination of the entity ID and randomizationSalt
              .

          scheduledSplitsDefinition -> (structure)
              An array of structures that define the traffic  allocation  per-
              centages  among  the  feature variations during each step of the
              launch.

              steps -> (list)
                 An array of structures that  define  the  traffic  allocation
                 percentages  among the feature variations during each step of
                 the launch. This also defines the start time of each step.

                 (structure)
                     This structure defines the traffic allocation percentages
                     among the feature variations during one step of a launch,
                     and the start time of that step.

                     groupWeights -> (map)
                        The traffic allocation percentages among  the  feature
                        variations  during one step of a launch. This is a set
                        of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names.  The
                        values represent the percentage of traffic to allocate
                        to that variation during this step.

                        The values is expressed in thousandths of  a  percent,
                        so  assigning a weight of 50000 assigns 50% of traffic
                        to that variation.

                        If the sum of the weights for all the variations in  a
                        segment  override does not add up to 100,000, then the
                        remaining traffic that matches this segment is not as-
                        signed  by this segment override, and instead moves on
                        to the next segment override or  the  default  traffic
                        split.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (long)

                     segmentOverrides -> (list)
                        Use this parameter to specify different traffic splits
                        for one or more audience segments .  A  segment  is  a
                        portion  of your audience that share one or more char-
                        acteristics. Examples could be Chrome  browser  users,
                        users  in  Europe,  or Firefox browser users in Europe
                        who also fit other criteria that your application col-
                        lects, such as age.

                        This  parameter is an array of up to six segment over-
                        ride objects. Each of these objects specifies  a  seg-
                        ment  that  you  have already created, and defines the
                        traffic split for that segment.

                        (structure)
                            This structure specifies a segment that  you  have
                            already created, and defines the traffic split for
                            that segment to be used in a launch.

                            evaluationOrder -> (long)
                               A number indicating the order to use to  evalu-
                               ate  segment  overrides, if there are more than
                               one. Segment overrides with lower  numbers  are
                               evaluated first.

                            segment -> (string)
                               The ARN of the segment to use.

                            weights -> (map)
                               The  traffic  allocation  percentages among the
                               feature variations to assign to  this  segment.
                               This  is a set of key-value pairs. The keys are
                               variation  names.  The  values  represent   the
                               amount of traffic to allocate to that variation
                               for this segment. This is  expressed  in  thou-
                               sandths of a percent, so a weight of 50000 rep-
                               resents 50% of traffic.

                               key -> (string)

                               value -> (long)

                     startTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time that this step of the launch starts.

          status -> (string)
              The current state of the launch.

          statusReason -> (string)
              If the launch was stopped, this is the string that  was  entered
              by  the  person  who  stopped  the launch, to explain why it was
              stopped.

          tags -> (map)
              The list of tag keys and values associated with this launch.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          type -> (string)
              The type of launch.
