       Don't  use  this  operation  to  update  the  data storage options of a
       project. Instead, use UpdateProjectDataDelivery .

OPTIONS
       --app-config-resource (structure)
          Use  this  parameter  if the project will use client-side evaluation
          powered by AppConfig. Client-side evaluation allows your application
          to  assign variations to user sessions locally instead of by calling
          the EvaluateFeature operation. This mitigates the latency and avail-
          ability risks that come with an API call. allows you to

          This  parameter  is  a structure that contains information about the
          AppConfig application that will be used for client-side evaluation.

          applicationId -> (string)
              The ID of the AppConfig application to use for client-side eval-
              uation.

          environmentId -> (string)
              The ID of the AppConfig environment to use for client-side eval-
              uation. This must be an environment that is within the  applica-
              tion that you specify for applicationId .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          applicationId=string,environmentId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "applicationId": "string",
            "environmentId": "string"
          }

       --description (string)
          An optional description of the project.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project to update.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
