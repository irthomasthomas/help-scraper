NAME
       update-project-data-delivery -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the data storage options for this project. If you store evalua-
       tion events, you an keep them and analyze them  on  your  own.  If  you
       choose not to store evaluation events, Evidently deletes them after us-
       ing them to produce metrics and other experiment results that  you  can
       view.

       You can't specify both cloudWatchLogs and s3Destination in the same op-
       eration.

OPTIONS
       --cloud-watch-logs (structure)
          A structure containing the CloudWatch Logs log group where you  want
          to store evaluation events.

          logGroup -> (string)
              The  name  of  the log group where the project stores evaluation
              events.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          logGroup=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "logGroup": "string"
          }

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that you  want  to  modify  the  data
          storage options for.

       --s3-destination (structure)
          A  structure  containing  the S3 bucket name and bucket prefix where
          you want to store evaluation events.

          bucket -> (string)
              The name of the bucket  in  which  Evidently  stores  evaluation
              events.

          prefix -> (string)
              The bucket prefix in which Evidently stores evaluation events.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucket=string,prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucket": "string",
            "prefix": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
