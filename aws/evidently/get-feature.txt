OPTIONS
       --feature (string)
          The name of the feature that you want to retrieve information for.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that contains the feature.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       feature -> (structure)
          A structure containing the configuration details of the feature.

          arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the feature.

          createdTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the feature is created.

          defaultVariation -> (string)
              The name of the variation that is used as the default variation.
              The default variation is served to users who are  not  allocated
              to any ongoing launches or experiments of this feature.

              This variation must also be listed in the variations structure.

              If you omit defaultVariation , the first variation listed in the
              variations structure is used as the default variation.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the feature.

          entityOverrides -> (map)
              A set of key-value pairs that specify users who should always be
              served  a  specific variation of a feature. Each key specifies a
              user using their user ID, account ID, or some other  identifier.
              The  value  specifies the name of the variation that the user is
              to be served.

              For the override to be successful, the value  of  the  key  must
              match the entityId used in the EvaluateFeature operation.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          evaluationRules -> (list)
              An  array of structures that define the evaluation rules for the
              feature.

              (structure)
                 A structure that contains the information about an evaluation
                 rule  for  this feature, if it is used in a launch or experi-
                 ment.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the experiment or launch.

                 type -> (string)
                     This value is aws.evidently.splits if this is an  evalua-
                     tion  rule for a launch, and it is aws.evidently.onlineab
                     if this is an evaluation rule for an experiment.

          evaluationStrategy -> (string)
              If this value is ALL_RULES , the traffic allocation specified by
              any  ongoing  launches  or experiments is being used. If this is
              DEFAULT_VARIATION , the default variation is being served to all
              users.

          lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the feature was most recently updated.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          valueType -> (string)
              Defines  the  type of value used to define the different feature
              variations. For more information, see Variation types

          variations -> (list)
              An array of structures that contain  the  configuration  of  the
              feature's different variations.

              (structure)
                 This  structure  contains the name and variation value of one
                 variation of a feature.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the variation.

                 value -> (tagged union structure)

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing  top  level keys can be set: boolValue, double-
                        Value, longValue, stringValue.

                     boolValue -> (boolean)
                        If this feature uses the Boolean variation type,  this
                        field contains the Boolean value of this variation.

                     doubleValue -> (double)
                        If  this  feature  uses  the  double integer variation
                        type, this field contains the double integer value  of
                        this variation.

                     longValue -> (long)
                        If  this  feature  uses  the long variation type, this
                        field contains the long value of this variation.

                     stringValue -> (string)
                        If this feature uses the string variation  type,  this
