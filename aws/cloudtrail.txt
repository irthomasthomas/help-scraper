NAME
       cloudtrail -

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of ac-
       tions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.

       CloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API  calls
       for  your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Ama-
       zon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the  identity  of  the
       user, the start time of the Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP
       address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned  by
       the service.

       NOTE:
          As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code  for  various
          programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android,
          etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic access to CloudTrail. For exam-
          ple,  the  SDKs  handle cryptographically signing requests, managing
          errors, and retrying requests automatically.  For  more  information
          about  the  Amazon  Web Services SDKs, including how to download and
          install them, see Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services .

       See the CloudTrail User Guide for information about the  data  that  is
       included  with  each  Amazon  Web  Services  API call listed in the log
       files.
