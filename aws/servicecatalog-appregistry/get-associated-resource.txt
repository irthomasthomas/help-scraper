OPTIONS
       --application (string)
          The name, ID, or ARN of the application.

       --resource-type (string)
          The type of resource associated with the application.

          Possible values:

          o CFN_STACK

          o RESOURCE_TAG_VALUE

       --resource (string)
          The name or ID of the resource associated with the application.

       --next-token (string)
          A  unique  pagination  token for each page of results. Make the call
          again with the returned token to retrieve the next page of results.

       --resource-tag-status (list)
          States whether an application tag is applied, not  applied,  in  the
          process of being applied, or skipped.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SUCCESS
            FAILED
            IN_PROGRESS
            SKIPPED

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of results to return. If the parameter is omit-
          ted, it defaults to 25. The value is optional.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
