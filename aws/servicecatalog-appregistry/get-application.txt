GET-APPLICATION()                                            GET-APPLICATION()



NAME
       get-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  metadata information about one of your applications. The ap-
       plication can be specified by its ARN, ID, or  name  (which  is  unique
       within  one account in one region at a given point in time). Specify by
       ARN or ID in automated workflows if you want to make sure that the  ex-
       act  same  application  is  returned  or a ResourceNotFoundException is
       thrown, avoiding the ABA addressing problem.

OPTIONS
       --application (string)
          The name, ID, or ARN of the application.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

                     created.

                     CREATE_COMPLETE  if  the  resource group was created suc-
