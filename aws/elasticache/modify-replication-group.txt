          The identifier of the replication group to modify.

       --replication-group-description (string)
          A description for the replication group. Maximum length is 255 char-
          acters.

       --primary-cluster-id (string)
          For  replication  groups with a single primary, if this parameter is
          specified, ElastiCache promotes the specified cluster in the  speci-
          fied  replication  group to the primary role. The nodes of all other
          clusters in the replication group are read replicas.

       --snapshotting-cluster-id (string)
          The cluster ID that is used as the daily  snapshot  source  for  the
          replication  group.  This parameter cannot be set for Redis (cluster
          mode enabled) replication groups.

       --automatic-failover-enabled |  --no-automatic-failover-enabled  (bool-
       ean)
          Determines  whether  a  read  replica  is  automatically promoted to
          read/write primary if the existing primary encounters a failure.

          Valid values: true | false

       --multi-az-enabled | --no-multi-az-enabled (boolean)
          A flag to indicate MultiAZ is enabled.

       --cache-security-group-names (list)
          A list of cache security group names to authorize for  the  clusters
          in  this replication group. This change is asynchronously applied as
          soon as possible.

          This parameter can be used only with  replication  group  containing
          clusters  running outside of an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon
          VPC).

          Constraints: Must contain no more than 255 alphanumeric  characters.

          "string" "string" ...

       --security-group-ids (list)
          Specifies  the  VPC  Security Groups associated with the clusters in
          the replication group.

          This parameter can be used only with  replication  group  containing
          clusters running in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          Specifies  the  weekly  time  range  during which maintenance on the
          cluster is performed. It is specified  as  a  range  in  the  format
          ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi  (24H  Clock  UTC).  The minimum maintenance
          window is a 60 minute period.

          Valid values for ddd are:

          o sun

          o mon

          o tue

          o wed

          o thu

       --notification-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to which  no-
          tifications are sent.

          NOTE:
              The Amazon SNS topic owner must be same as the replication group
              owner.

       --cache-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the cache parameter group to apply to all of  the  clus-
          ters  in  this  replication group. This change is asynchronously ap-
          plied as soon as possible for parameters when  the  ApplyImmediately
          parameter is specified as true for this request.

       --notification-topic-status (string)
          The  status of the Amazon SNS notification topic for the replication
          group. Notifications are sent only if the status is active .

          Valid values: active | inactive

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          If true , this parameter causes the modifications  in  this  request
          and  any  pending modifications to be applied, asynchronously and as
          soon as possible, regardless of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow  set-
          ting for the replication group.

          If false , changes to the nodes in the replication group are applied
          on the next maintenance reboot, or the next failure  reboot,  which-
          ever occurs first.

          Valid values: true | false

          Default: false

       --engine-version (string)
          The  upgraded  version of the cache engine to be run on the clusters
          in the replication group.
              Important: You can  upgrade  to  a  newer  engine  version  (see
              Selecting a Cache Engine and Version ), but you cannot downgrade
              to an earlier engine version. If you want to use an earlier  en-
              gine version, you must delete the existing replication group and
              create it anew with the earlier engine version.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade  (bool-
       ean)
          If  you  are running Redis engine version 6.0 or later, set this pa-
          rameter to yes if you want to opt-in to the next auto minor  version
          upgrade campaign. This parameter is disabled for previous versions.

       --snapshot-retention-limit (integer)
          The  number  of  days  for  which ElastiCache retains automatic node
          group (shard) snapshots before deleting them. For  example,  if  you
          set  SnapshotRetentionLimit to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is
          retained for 5 days before being deleted.
              Important If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to  zero
              (0), backups are turned off.

       --snapshot-window (string)
          The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking
          a daily snapshot of the node group (shard)  specified  by  Snapshot-
          tingClusterId .

          Example: 05:00-09:00

          If  you  do  not  specify  this parameter, ElastiCache automatically
          chooses an appropriate time range.

       --cache-node-type (string)
          A valid cache node type that you  want  to  scale  this  replication
          group to.

       --auth-token (string)
          Reserved parameter. The password used to access a password protected
          server. This parameter must be  specified  with  the  auth-token-up-
          date-strategy parameter. Password constraints:

          o Must be only printable ASCII characters

          o Must  be at least 16 characters and no more than 128 characters in

          For more information, see AUTH password at AUTH .

       --auth-token-update-strategy (string)
          Specifies the strategy to use to update the AUTH token. This parame-
          ter must be specified with the auth-token parameter.  Possible  val-
          ues:

          o Rotate

          o Set

          For more information, see Authenticating Users with Redis AUTH

          Possible values:

                },
                "KinesisFirehoseDetails": {
                  "DeliveryStream": "string"
                }

            }
            ...
          ]

       --ip-discovery (string)
          The network type you choose when modifying a cluster, either ipv4  |
          ipv6  .  IPv6  is supported for workloads using Redis engine version
          6.2 onward or Memcached engine version 1.6.6 on all instances  built
          on the Nitro system .

          Possible values:

          o ipv4

          o ipv6

       --transit-encryption-enabled  |  --no-transit-encryption-enabled (bool-
       ean)
          A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to true.  If  you
          are enabling in-transit encryption for an existing cluster, you must
          also set TransitEncryptionMode to preferred .

       --transit-encryption-mode (string)
          A setting that allows you to migrate your clients to use  in-transit
          encryption, with no downtime.

          You  must  set  TransitEncryptionEnabled to true , for your existing
          cluster, and set TransitEncryptionMode to preferred in the same  re-
          quest  to  allow  both  encrypted and unencrypted connections at the
          same time. Once you migrate all your Redis clients to use  encrypted
          connections  you  can  set  the value to required to allow encrypted
          connections only.

          Setting TransitEncryptionMode to required is a two-step process that
          requires  you  to first set the TransitEncryptionMode to preferred ,
          after that you can set TransitEncryptionMode to required .

          Possible values:

          o preferred

          o required

       --cluster-mode (string)
          Enabled or Disabled. To modify cluster mode  from  Disabled  to  En-
          abled, you must first set the cluster mode to Compatible. Compatible
          mode allows your Redis clients to connect using  both  cluster  mode
          enabled  and  cluster  mode  disabled.  After  you migrate all Redis
          clients to use cluster mode enabled, you can then  complete  cluster
          mode configuration and set the cluster mode to Enabled.

          Possible values:

          o enabled

          o disabled

          o compatible

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify a replication group

       The  following modify-replication-group disables Multi-AZ using the Re-
       dis engine.

                     ter mode disabled) replication group contains only 1 node
                     group; therefore, the node group  ID  is  0001.  A  Redis
                     (cluster mode enabled) replication group contains 1 to 90
                     node groups numbered 0001 to 0090. Optionally,  the  user
                     can provide the id for a node group.
