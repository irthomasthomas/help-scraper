       --remove-user-group | --no-remove-user-group (boolean)
          The  identifier of the UserGroup to be removed from association with
          the Redis OSS serverless cache. Available for Redis  OSS  only.  De-
          fault is NULL.

          The  new  list  of  VPC  security  groups  to be associated with the
          serverless cache. Populating this list means the current  VPC  secu-
          rity  groups  will be removed. This security group is used to autho-
          rize traffic access for the VPC end-point (private-link). Default  =
          NULL - the existing list of VPC security groups is not removed.

          (string)

       Syntax:

       --snapshot-retention-limit (integer)
          The number of days for which Elasticache retains automatic snapshots
          before deleting them. Available for Redis OSS  and  Serverless  Mem-
          cached  only.  Default  =  NULL,  i.e.  the existing snapshot-reten-
          tion-limit will not be removed or modified. The  maximum  value  al-
          lowed is 35 days.

       --daily-snapshot-time (string)

          Memcached only. The default is NULL, i.e. the existing snapshot time
          configured for the cluster is not removed.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
