NAME
       create-global-replication-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Global Datastore for Redis offers fully managed, fast, reliable and se-
       cure cross-region replication. Using Global Datastore  for  Redis,  you
       can create cross-region read replica clusters for ElastiCache for Redis
       to enable low-latency reads and disaster recovery across  regions.  For
       more information, see Replication Across Regions Using Global Datastore
       .

       o The GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix is the name of the  Global  datas-
         tore.

       o The  PrimaryReplicationGroupId  represents  the  name  of the primary
         cluster that accepts writes and will replicate updates  to  the  sec-
         ondary cluster.

OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id-suffix (string)
          The  suffix name of a Global datastore. Amazon ElastiCache automati-
          cally applies a prefix to the Global datastore ID when  it  is  cre-
          ated.  Each Amazon Region has its own prefix. For instance, a Global
          datastore ID created in the US-West-1 region will begin with "dsdfu"
          along  with  the  suffix name you provide. The suffix, combined with
          the auto-generated prefix, guarantees uniqueness of the Global data-
          store name across multiple regions.

          For a full list of Amazon Regions and their respective Global datas-
          tore iD prefixes, see Using the Amazon CLI with Global datastores .

       --global-replication-group-description (string)
          Provides details of the Global datastore

       --primary-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the primary cluster that accepts writes and will  repli-
          cate updates to the secondary cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a global replication group

       The  following  create-global-replication-group  example  creates a new
       global replication group.

          aws elasticache create-global-replication-group \
              --global-replication-group-id-suffix my-global-replication-group \
              --primary-replication-group-id my-primary-cluster

          cally replicates updates to the secondary cluster.

              cannot  modify  the  value of TransitEncryptionEnabled after the
              cluster is created. To enable in-transit encryption on a cluster
              you  must set TransitEncryptionEnabled to true when you create a
              cluster.
                 Required: Only available when creating a replication group in
                 an Amazon VPC using redis version 3.2.6 , 4.x or later.
