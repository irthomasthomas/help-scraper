NAME
       delete-global-replication-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Deleting a Global datastore is a two-step process:

       o First,  you  must   DisassociateGlobalReplicationGroup  to remove the
         secondary clusters in the Global datastore.

       o Once the Global datastore contains only the primary cluster, you  can
         use  the DeleteGlobalReplicationGroup API to delete the Global datas-
         tore while retainining the primary cluster using  RetainPrimaryRepli-
         cationGroup=true .

       Since  the  Global Datastore has only a primary cluster, you can delete
       the Global Datastore while retaining the primary by setting  RetainPri-
       maryReplicationGroup=true  .  The primary cluster is never deleted when
       deleting a Global Datastore. It can only be deleted when it  no  longer
       is associated with any Global Datastore.

       When  you  receive  a  successful  response from this operation, Amazon
       ElastiCache immediately begins deleting  the  selected  resources;  you
       cannot cancel or revert this operation.

          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]

          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the Global datastore

       --retain-primary-replication-group    |    --no-retain-primary-replica-
       tion-group (boolean)
          The primary replication group is retained as a  standalone  replica-
          tion group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a global replication group

       The following delete-global-replication-group  example  deletes  a  new
       global replication group.

          aws elasticache delete-global-replication-group \
              --global-replication-group-id my-global-replication-group \
              --retain-primary-replication-group

                 Group Id, the Amazon region and the role of  the  replication
                 group.

                 ReplicationGroupId -> (string)
                     The replication group id of the Global datastore member.

                 ReplicationGroupRegion -> (string)

                 Role -> (string)
                     Indicates  the  role of the replication group, primary or
                     secondary.

                 AutomaticFailover -> (string)
                     Indicates whether automatic failover is enabled  for  the
                     replication group.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the membership of the replication group.

              enabled.

          GlobalNodeGroups -> (list)
              Indicates the slot configuration and global identifier for  each
              slice group.

              (structure)
                 Indicates  the slot configuration and global identifier for a
                 slice group.

              A flag that enables encryption at rest when set to true .

              You cannot modify the value of AtRestEncryptionEnabled after the
              replication  group is created. To enable encryption at rest on a
              replication group you must set AtRestEncryptionEnabled  to  true
              when you create the replication group.
                 Required: Only available when creating a replication group in
                 an Amazon VPC using Redis OSS version 3.2.6 , 4.x or later.
