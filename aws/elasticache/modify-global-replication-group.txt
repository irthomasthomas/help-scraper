OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the Global datastore

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          This  parameter  causes  the  modifications  in this request and any
          pending modifications to be applied, asynchronously and as  soon  as
          possible.  Modifications  to Global Replication Groups cannot be re-
          quested to be applied in PreferredMaintenceWindow.

       --cache-node-type (string)
          A valid cache node type that you want to scale this Global datastore
          to.

       --engine-version (string)
          The  upgraded  version of the cache engine to be run on the clusters
          in the Global datastore.

       --cache-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the cache parameter group to use with the Global  datas-
          tore.  It  must  be compatible with the major engine version used by
          the Global datastore.

       --global-replication-group-description (string)
          A description of the Global datastore

       --automatic-failover-enabled |  --no-automatic-failover-enabled  (bool-
       ean)
          Determines  whether  a  read  replica  is  automatically promoted to
          read/write primary if the existing primary encounters a failure.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify a global replication group

       The following modify-global-replication-group modifies  the  properties
       of  a  global  replication  group,  in  this  case  disabling automatic
       failover, using the Redis engine.

              --global-replication-group-id sgaui-pat-group \
              --apply-immediately \
              --no-automatic-failover-enabled

OUTPUT
       GlobalReplicationGroup -> (structure)

          cally replicates updates to the secondary cluster.

          o The GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix  represents  the  name  of  the

              you  must set TransitEncryptionEnabled to true when you create a
              cluster.
                 Required: Only available when creating a replication group in
