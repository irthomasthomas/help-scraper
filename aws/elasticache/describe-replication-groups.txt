DESCRIBE-REPLICATION-GROUPS()                    DESCRIBE-REPLICATION-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-replication-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a particular replication group. If no identi-
       fier is specified, DescribeReplicationGroups returns information  about
       all replication groups.

       NOTE:
          This operation is valid for Valkey or Redis OSS only.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-replication-groups  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ReplicationGroups

OPTIONS
       --replication-group-id (string)
          The identifier for the replication group to be described.  This  pa-
          rameter is not case sensitive.

          If you do not specify this parameter, information about all replica-
          tion groups is returned.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following describe-replication-groups example returns the  replica-
       tion groups.

                     A  flag  that  enables  in-transit encryption when set to
                     true.

                 TransitEncryptionMode -> (string)

                     in-transit encryption, with no downtime.

                 ClusterMode -> (string)
                     Enabled or Disabled. To modify cluster mode from Disabled
                     to Enabled, you must first set the cluster mode  to  Com-
                     patible.  Compatible mode allows your Valkey or Redis OSS
                     clients to connect using both cluster  mode  enabled  and
                     cluster  mode  disabled.  After you migrate all Valkey or
                     Redis OSS clients to use cluster mode  enabled,  you  can

                        ID  is  0001.  A Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode en-
                        abled) replication group contains 1 to 90 node  groups
                        numbered  0001  to 0090. Optionally, the user can pro-

                     ReaderEndpoint -> (structure)
                        The  endpoint  of the replica nodes in this node group
                        (shard). This value is read-only.

                        Address -> (string)
                            The DNS hostname of the cache node.

                               endpoint  is only applicable on Valkey or Redis
                               OSS (cluster mode disabled) clusters.

                     If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit  is  set  to  zero

                 If you do not specify this parameter,  ElastiCache  automati-
                 cally chooses an appropriate time range.

                 NOTE:
                     This  parameter  is only valid if the Engine parameter is

                 connect using both cluster mode enabled and cluster mode dis-
                 abled. After you migrate all Valkey or Redis OSS  clients  to
                 use  cluster mode enabled, you can then complete cluster mode
                 configuration and set the cluster mode to Enabled.
