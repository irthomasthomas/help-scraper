NAME
       decrease-replica-count -

DESCRIPTION
       Dynamically  decreases  the number of replicas in a Redis (cluster mode
       disabled) replication group or the number of replica nodes  in  one  or
       more node groups (shards) of a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication
       group. This operation is performed with no cluster down time.

OPTIONS
       --replication-group-id (string)
          The id of the replication  group  from  which  you  want  to  remove
          replica nodes.

       --new-replica-count (integer)
          The  number of read replica nodes you want at the completion of this
          operation. For Redis (cluster  mode  disabled)  replication  groups,
          this  is  the  number of replica nodes in the replication group. For
          Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication groups, this is the  number
          of replica nodes in each of the replication group's node groups.

          The minimum number of replicas in a shard or replication group is:

          o Redis (cluster mode disabled)

            o If Multi-AZ is enabled: 1

            o If Multi-AZ is not enabled: 0

          o Redis  (cluster  mode  enabled): 0 (though you will not be able to
            failover to a replica if your primary node fails)

       --replica-configuration (list)
          A list of ConfigureShard objects that can be used to configure  each
          shard  in a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group. The Con-
          figureShard has three members: NewReplicaCount , NodeGroupId  ,  and
          PreferredAvailabilityZones .

          (structure)
              Node group (shard) configuration options when adding or removing
              replicas. Each node group (shard) configuration has the  follow-
              ing  members:  NodeGroupId, NewReplicaCount, and PreferredAvail-
              abilityZones.

              NodeGroupId -> (string)
                 The 4-digit id for the node group you  are  configuring.  For
                 Redis  (cluster  mode  disabled) replication groups, the node
                 group id is always 0001. To find a Redis  (cluster  mode  en-
                 abled)'s  node group's (shard's) id, see Finding a Shard's Id
                 .

              NewReplicaCount -> (integer)
                 The number of replicas you want in this node group at the end
                 of  this  operation. The maximum value for NewReplicaCount is
                 5. The minimum value depends upon the type of Redis  replica-
                 tion group you are working with.

                 The  minimum  number  of  replicas  in a shard or replication
                 group is:

                 o Redis (cluster mode disabled)

                   o If Multi-AZ: 1

                   o If Multi-AZ: 0

                 o Redis (cluster mode enabled): 0 (though  you  will  not  be
                   able to failover to a replica if your primary node fails)

              PreferredAvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 A  list  of  PreferredAvailabilityZone  strings  that specify
                 which availability zones the replication group's nodes are to
                 be  in.  The nummber of PreferredAvailabilityZone values must
                 equal the value of NewReplicaCount plus 1 to account for  the
                 primary node. If this member of ReplicaConfiguration is omit-
                 ted, ElastiCache for Redis selects the availability zone  for
                 each of the replicas.

                 (string)

              PreferredOutpostArns -> (list)
                 The outpost ARNs in which the cache cluster is created.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NodeGroupId=string,NewReplicaCount=integer,PreferredAvailabilityZones=string,string,PreferredOutpostArns=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "NodeGroupId": "string",
              "NewReplicaCount": integer,
              "PreferredAvailabilityZones": ["string", ...],
              "PreferredOutpostArns": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --replicas-to-remove (list)
          A  list of the node ids to remove from the replication group or node
          group (shard).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          If True , the number of replica nodes is decreased immediately.  Ap-
          plyImmediately=False is not currently supported.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To decrease replica count

       The  following decrease-replica-count example dynamically decreases the
       number of replics in a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication  group
       or the number of replica nodes in one or more node groups (shards) of a
       Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group. This operation is  per-
       formed with no cluster downtime.

                     group;  therefore,  the  node  group  ID is 0001. A Redis
                     (cluster mode enabled) replication group contains 1 to 90
                     node  groups  numbered 0001 to 0090. Optionally, the user
