OPTIONS
       --acl-name (string)
          The name of the ACL

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxResults value, a  token  is  in-
          cluded  in  the  response  so  that the remaining results can be re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds  the  value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To return a list of ACLs

       The following describe-acls` returns a list of ACLs.

          aws memorydb describe-acls

       Output:

          {
              "ACLs": [
                  {
                      "Name": "open-access",
                      "Status": "active",
                      "UserNames": [
                          "default"
                      ],
                      "MinimumEngineVersion": "6.2",
                      "Clusters": [],
                      "ARN": "arn:aws:memorydb:us-east-1:491658xxxxxx:acl/open-access"
                  },
                  {
                      "Name": my-acl",
                      "Status": "active",
                      "UserNames": [],
                      "MinimumEngineVersion": "6.2",
                      "Clusters": [
                          "my-cluster"
                      ],
                      "ARN": "arn:aws:memorydb:us-east-1:49165xxxxxxx:acl/my-acl"
                  }
              ]
          }

          (structure)
              An  Access  Control List. You can authenticate users with Access
              Contol Lists. ACLs enable  you  to  control  cluster  access  by
              grouping users. These Access control lists are designed as a way
              to organize access to clusters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the Access Control List

              Status -> (string)
                 Indicates ACL status. Can be "creating",  "active",  "modify-
                 ing", "deleting".

              UserNames -> (list)
                 The list of user names that belong to the ACL.

                 (string)

              MinimumEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The minimum engine version supported for the ACL

              PendingChanges -> (structure)
                 A list of updates being applied to the ACL.

                 UserNamesToRemove -> (list)
                     A list of user names being removed from the ACL

                     (string)

                 UserNamesToAdd -> (list)
                     A list of users being added to the ACL

                     (string)

              Clusters -> (list)
                 A list of clusters associated with the ACL.

                 (string)

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACL

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  nextToken  is  returned,  there  are more results available. The
          value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.  Make
          the  call  again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged.
