DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  events  related  to  clusters,  security groups, and parameter
       groups. You can obtain events specific to a particular  cluster,  secu-
       rity group, or parameter group by providing the name as a parameter. By
       default, only the events occurring within the last hour  are  returned;
       however, you can retrieve up to 14 days' worth of events if necessary.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Events

OPTIONS
       --source-name (string)
          The identifier of the event source for which events are returned. If
          not specified, all sources are included in the response.

       --source-type (string)
          The  event  source to retrieve events for. If no value is specified,
          all events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o node

          o parameter-group

          o subnet-group

          o cluster

          o user

          o acl

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified
          in ISO 8601 format. Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified
          in ISO 8601 format. Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --duration (integer)
          The number of minutes worth of events to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To return a list of events

       The following describe-events` returns a list of events.

          aws memorydb describe-events

       Output:

          {
              "Events": [
                  {
                      "SourceName": "my-cluster",
                      "SourceType": "cluster",
                      "Message": "Increase replica count started for replication group my-cluster on 2022-07-22T14:09:01.440Z",
                      "Date": "2022-07-22T07:09:01.443000-07:00"
                  },
                  {
                      "SourceName": "my-user",
                      "SourceType": "user",
                      "Message": "Create user my-user operation completed.",
                      "Date": "2022-07-22T07:00:02.975000-07:00"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned,  there  are
          more  results  available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       Events -> (list)
          A  list of events. Each element in the list contains detailed infor-
          mation about one event.

          (structure)
              Represents a single occurrence of something  interesting  within
              the  system.  Some  examples of events are creating a cluster or
              adding or removing a node.

              SourceName -> (string)
                 The name for the source of the event.  For  example,  if  the
                 event  occurred at the cluster level, the identifier would be
                 the name of the cluster.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies the origin of this event - a cluster,  a  parameter
                 group, a security group, etc.

              Message -> (string)
                 The text of the event.

              Date -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the event occurred.
