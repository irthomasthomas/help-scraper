DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  events  related  to  clusters,  security groups, and parameter
       groups. You can obtain events specific to a particular  cluster,  secu-
       rity group, or parameter group by providing the name as a parameter. By
       default, only the events occurring within the last hour  are  returned;
       however, you can retrieve up to 14 days' worth of events if necessary.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-events
          [--source-name <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--duration <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-name (string)
          The identifier of the event source for which events are returned. If
          not specified, all sources are included in the response.

       --source-type (string)
          The event source to retrieve events for. If no value  is  specified,
          all events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o node

          o parameter-group

          o subnet-group

          o cluster

          o user

          o acl

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified
          in ISO 8601 format. Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified
          in ISO 8601 format. Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --duration (integer)
          The number of minutes worth of events to retrieve.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxResults value, a  token  is  in-
          cluded  in  the  response  so  that the remaining results can be re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds  the  value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To return a list of events

       The following describe-events` returns a list of events.

          aws memorydb describe-events

       Output:

          {
              "Events": [
                  {
                      "SourceName": "my-cluster",
                      "SourceType": "cluster",
                      "Message": "Increase replica count started for replication group my-cluster on 2022-07-22T14:09:01.440Z",
                      "Date": "2022-07-22T07:09:01.443000-07:00"
                  },
                  {
                      "SourceName": "my-user",
                      "SourceType": "user",
                      "Message": "Create user my-user operation completed.",
                      "Date": "2022-07-22T07:00:02.975000-07:00"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds  the  value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       Events -> (list)
          A list of events. Each element in the list contains detailed  infor-
          mation about one event.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single occurrence of something interesting within
              the system. Some examples of events are creating  a  cluster  or
              adding or removing a node.

              SourceName -> (string)
                 The  name  for  the  source of the event. For example, if the
                 event occurred at the cluster level, the identifier would  be
                 the name of the cluster.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  origin of this event - a cluster, a parameter
                 group, a security group, etc.

              Message -> (string)
                 The text of the event.

              Date -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the event occurred.
