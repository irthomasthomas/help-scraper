DESCRIBE-RESERVED-NODES()                            DESCRIBE-RESERVED-NODES()



NAME
       describe-reserved-nodes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about reserved nodes for this account, or about a
       specified reserved node.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-reserved-nodes is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ReservedNodes

OPTIONS
       --reservation-id (string)
          The  reserved  node  identifier  filter value. Use this parameter to
          show only the reservation that matches the specified reservation ID.

       --reserved-nodes-offering-id (string)
          The offering identifier filter value. Use  this  parameter  to  show
          only  purchased reservations matching the specified offering identi-
          fier.

       --node-type (string)
          The node type filter value. Use this parameter to  show  only  those
          reservations matching the specified node type. For more information,
          see Supported node types .

       --duration (string)
          The duration filter value, specified in years or seconds.  Use  this
          parameter to show only reservations for this duration.

       --offering-type (string)
          The  offering type filter value. Use this parameter to show only the
          available offerings matching the specified offering type. Valid val-
          ues: "All Upfront"|"Partial Upfront"| "No Upfront"

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
