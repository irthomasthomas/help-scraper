CREATE-SUBNET-GROUP()                                    CREATE-SUBNET-GROUP()



NAME
       create-subnet-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a subnet group. A subnet group is a collection of subnets (typ-
       ically private) that you can designate for your clusters running in  an
       Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. When you create a clus-
       ter in an Amazon VPC, you must specify a subnet  group.  MemoryDB  uses
       that  subnet group to choose a subnet and IP addresses within that sub-
       net to associate with your nodes. For more information, see Subnets and
       subnet groups .

OPTIONS
       --subnet-group-name (string)
          The name of the subnet group.

       --description (string)
          A description for the subnet group.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          A list of VPC subnet IDs for the subnet group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags to be added to this resource. A tag is a key-value
          pair. A tag key must be accompanied by a tag value, although null is
          accepted.

          (structure)
              A  tag  that can be added to an MemoryDB resource. Tags are com-
              posed of a Key/Value pair. You can use tags  to  categorize  and
              track  all  your MemoryDB resources. When you add or remove tags
              on clusters, those actions will be replicated to  all  nodes  in
              the  cluster. A tag with a null Value is permitted. For more in-
              formation, see Tagging your MemoryDB resources

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. May not be null.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value. May be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a subnet group

       The following create-subnet-group example creates a subnet group.

          aws memorydb create-subnet-group \
              --subnet-group-name mysubnetgroup \
              --description "my subnet group" \
              --subnet-ids subnet-5623xxxx

       Output:

          {
              "SubnetGroup": {
                  "Name": "mysubnetgroup",
                  "Description": "my subnet group",
                  "VpcId": "vpc-86257xxx",
                  "Subnets": [
                      {
                          "Identifier": "subnet-5623xxxx",
                          "AvailabilityZone": {
                              "Name": "us-east-1a"
                          }
                      }
                  ],
                  "ARN": "arn:aws:memorydb:us-east-1:491658xxxxxx:subnetgroup/mysubnetgroup"
              }
          }
