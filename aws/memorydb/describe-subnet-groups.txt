DESCRIBE-SUBNET-GROUPS()                              DESCRIBE-SUBNET-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-subnet-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of subnet group descriptions. If a subnet group name is
       specified, the list contains only the description of that group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-subnet-groups
          [--subnet-group-name <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subnet-group-name (string)
          The name of the subnet group to return details for.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of records to include in the  response.  If  more
          records  exist  than  the specified MaxResults value, a token is in-
          cluded in the response so that the  remaining  results  can  be  re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned,  there  are
          more  results  available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To return a list of subnet groups

       The following describe-subnet-groups` returns a list of subnet groups.

          aws memorydb describe-subnet-groups

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds  the  value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       SubnetGroups -> (list)
          A list of subnet groups. Each element in the list contains  detailed
          information about one group.

          (structure)
              Represents the output of one of the following operations:

              o CreateSubnetGroup

              o UpdateSubnetGroup

              A  subnet  group  is a collection of subnets (typically private)
              that you can designate for your clusters running  in  an  Amazon
              Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the subnet group

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the subnet group

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Virtual Private Cloud identifier (VPC ID) of the
                 subnet group.

              Subnets -> (list)
                 A list of subnets associated with the subnet group.

                 (structure)
                     Represents the subnet associated with a cluster. This pa-
                     rameter  refers to subnets defined in Amazon Virtual Pri-
                     vate Cloud (Amazon VPC) and used with MemoryDB.

                     Identifier -> (string)
