OPTIONS
       --reserved-nodes-offering-id (string)
          The ID of the reserved node offering to purchase.

       --reservation-id (string)
          A customer-specified identifier to track this reservation.

       --node-count (integer)
          The number of node instances to reserve.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to be added to this resource. A tag  is  a  key-value
          pair. A tag key must be accompanied by a tag value, although null is
          accepted.

          (structure)
              A tag that can be added to an MemoryDB resource. Tags  are  com-
              posed  of  a  Key/Value pair. You can use tags to categorize and
              track all your MemoryDB resources. When you add or  remove  tags
              on  clusters,  those  actions will be replicated to all nodes in
              the cluster. A tag with a null Value is permitted. For more  in-
              formation, see Tagging your MemoryDB resources

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. May not be null.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value. May be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
