                        fault value of the attribute is "RAW". SNS  uses  this
                        setting  to  determine if the payload should be parsed
                        and relevant platform-specific  bits  of  the  payload
                        should  be  extracted.  To read more about SNS message

                        in the URL, you must also specify a confirmationUrl  .
                        If  this is a new destination, a new TopicRuleDestina-

                     of  the  attribute is "RAW". SNS uses this setting to de-
                     termine if the payload  should  be  parsed  and  relevant
                     platform-specific  bits  of  the  payload  should  be ex-
                     tracted. To read more  about  SNS  message  formats,  see

                     You  can  use  this property to specify the value and the
                     precision of the Timestream record's timestamp.  You  can
                     specify  a value from the message payload or a value com-
                     puted by a substitution template.

                     If omitted, the topic rule action assigns the  timestamp,

                     the URL, you must also specify  a  confirmationUrl  .  If
                     this  is a new destination, a new TopicRuleDestination is
                     created if possible.

                 confirmationUrl -> (string)
                     The URL to which IoT sends a  confirmation  message.  The

                     endpoint URL. If you do not specify  a  confirmation  URL
                     IoT uses the endpoint URL as the confirmation URL. If you
                     use substitution templates in  the  confirmationUrl,  you
                     must create and enable topic rule destinations that match
                     each possible value of the substitution  template  before
                     traffic is allowed to your endpoint URL.

                        you  create  a  Rules  Kafka Action. You can use these
                        headers to route data from IoT clients  to  downstream
                        Kafka clusters without modifying your message payload.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a topic's rule definition

       The following replace-topic-rule example updates the specified rule  to
       send an SNS alert when soil moisture level readings are too low.
