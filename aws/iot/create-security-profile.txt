OPTIONS
       --security-profile-name (string)
          The name you are giving to the security profile.

       --security-profile-description (string)
          A description of the security profile.

       --behaviors (list)
          Specifies  the  behaviors  that,  when violated by a device (thing),
          cause an alert.

          (structure)
              A Device Defender security profile behavior.

              name -> (string)
                 The name you've given to the behavior.

              metric -> (string)
                 What is measured by the behavior.

              metricDimension -> (structure)
                 The dimension for a metric in your behavior. For example, us-
                 ing  a  TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow down the scope
                 of the metric to only MQTT topics where the name matches  the
                 pattern  specified  in the dimension. This can't be used with
                 custom metrics.

                 dimensionName -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the dimension.

                 operator -> (string)
                     Defines how the dimensionValues of a dimension are inter-
                     preted. For example, for dimension type TOPIC_FILTER, the
                     IN operator, a message will be counted only if its  topic
                     matches one of the topic filters. With NOT_IN operator, a
                     message will be counted only if it doesn't match  any  of
                     the  topic filters. The operator is optional: if it's not
                     provided (is null ), it will be interpreted as IN .

              criteria -> (structure)
                 The criteria that determine if a device is behaving  normally
                 in regard to the metric .

                 NOTE:
                     In  the  IoT  console, you can choose to be sent an alert
                     through Amazon SNS when IoT Device Defender detects  that
                     a device is behaving anomalously.

                 comparisonOperator -> (string)
                     The operator that relates the thing measured (metric ) to
                     the criteria (containing a value or  statisticalThreshold
                     ). Valid operators include:

                     o string-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o number-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o ip-address-list : in-cidr-set and not-in-cidr-set

                     o number  : less-than , less-than-equals , greater-than ,
                       and greater-than-equals

                 value -> (structure)
                     The value to be compared with the metric .

                     count -> (long)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  numeric  value,
                        use  this to specify that numeric value to be compared
                        with the metric .

                     cidrs -> (list)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  set  of  CIDRs,
                        use  this  to specify that set to be compared with the
                        metric .

                        (string)

                     ports -> (list)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  set  of  ports,
                        use  this  to specify that set to be compared with the
                        metric .

                        (integer)

                     number -> (double)
                        The numeral value of a metric.

                     numbers -> (list)
                        The numeral values of a metric.

                        (double)

                     strings -> (list)
                        The string values of a metric.

                        (string)

                 durationSeconds -> (integer)
                     Use this to specify the time duration over which the  be-
                     havior  is evaluated, for those criteria that have a time
                     dimension (for example, NUM_MESSAGES_SENT ). For  a  sta-
                     tisticalThreshhold  metric  comparison, measurements from
                     all devices are accumulated over this time  duration  be-
                     fore being used to calculate percentiles, and later, mea-
                     surements from an individual device are also  accumulated
                     over  this  time duration before being given a percentile
                     rank. Cannot be used with list-based metric datatypes.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                     If a device is in violation of the behavior for the spec-
                     ified  number of consecutive datapoints, an alarm occurs.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToClear -> (integer)
                     If an alarm has occurred and the offending device  is  no
                     longer  in  violation  of  the behavior for the specified
                     number of consecutive datapoints, the alarm  is  cleared.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 statisticalThreshold -> (structure)
                     A   statistical   ranking  (percentile)that  indicates  a
                     threshold value by which a behavior is determined  to  be
                     in compliance or in violation of the behavior.

                     statistic -> (string)
                        The  percentile  that resolves to a threshold value by
                        which compliance with a behavior is  determined.  Met-
                        rics  are  collected  over the specified period (dura-
                        tionSeconds ) from all reporting devices in  your  ac-
                        count  and statistical ranks are calculated. Then, the
                        measurements from a device are collected over the same
                        period.  If  the accumulated measurements from the de-
                        vice fall above or  below  (comparisonOperator  )  the
                        value  associated  with the percentile specified, then
                        the device is considered to be in compliance with  the
                        behavior, otherwise a violation occurs.

                 mlDetectionConfig -> (structure)
                     The configuration of an ML Detect

                     confidenceLevel -> (string)
                        The  sensitivity of anomalous behavior evaluation. Can
                        be Low , Medium , or High .

              suppressAlerts -> (boolean)
                 Suppresses alerts.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a security profile

       The following create-security-profile example creates a  security  pro-
       file  that  checks if cellular bandwidth exceeds a threshold or if more
       than 10 authorization failures occur within a five-minute period.

          aws iot create-security-profile \
              --security-profile-name PossibleIssue \
              --security-profile-description "Check to see if authorization fails 10 times in 5 minutes or if cellular bandwidth exceeds 128"  \
              --behaviors "[{\"name\":\"CellularBandwidth\",\"metric\":\"aws:message-byte-size\",\"criteria\":{\"comparisonOperator\":\"greater-than\",\"value\":{\"count\":128},\"consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm\":1,\"consecutiveDatapointsToClear\":1}},{\"name\":\"Authorization\",\"metric\":\"aws:num-authorization-failures\",\"criteria\":{\"comparisonOperator\":\"less-than\",\"value\":{\"count\":10},\"durationSeconds\":300,\"consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm\":1,\"consecutiveDatapointsToClear\":1}}]"

       Output:

          {
              "securityProfileName": "PossibleIssue",
              "securityProfileArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:securityprofile/PossibleIssue"
          }
