OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing on which the job execution is running.

       --execution-number (long)
          A  string (consisting of the digits "0" through "9" which is used to
          specify a particular job execution on a particular device.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get execution details for a job on a device

       The following describe-job-execution example gets execution details for
       the specified job.

          aws iot describe-job-execution \
              --job-id "example-job-01" \
              --thing-name "MyRaspberryPi"

       Output:

          {
              "execution": {
                  "jobId": "example-job-01",
                  "status": "QUEUED",
                  "statusDetails": {},
                  "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/MyRaspberryPi",
                  "queuedAt": 1560787023.636,
                  "lastUpdatedAt": 1560787023.636,
                  "executionNumber": 1,
                  "versionNumber": 1
              }
          }

       IoT Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       execution -> (structure)
          Information about the job execution.

          jobId -> (string)
              The unique identifier you assigned to the job when it  was  cre-
              ated.

          status -> (string)
              The  status  of  the job execution (IN_PROGRESS, QUEUED, FAILED,
              SUCCEEDED, TIMED_OUT, CANCELED, or REJECTED).

          forceCanceled -> (boolean)
              Will be true if the job execution was canceled with the optional
              force parameter set to true .

          statusDetails -> (structure)
              A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the
              job execution.

              detailsMap -> (map)
                 The job execution status.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

          thingArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the thing on which the job execution is running.

          queuedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job execution was
              queued.

          startedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time,  in  seconds  since the epoch, when the job execution
              started.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job execution was
              last updated.

          executionNumber -> (long)
              A  string (consisting of the digits "0" through "9") which iden-
              tifies this particular job execution on this particular  device.
              It  can be used in commands which return or update job execution
              information.

          versionNumber -> (long)
              The version of the job execution. Job execution versions are in-
              cremented each time they are updated by a device.

          approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut -> (long)
              The  estimated number of seconds that remain before the job exe-
              cution status will be changed to TIMED_OUT . The timeout  inter-
              val can be anywhere between 1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 min-
              utes). The actual job execution timeout can occur up to 60  sec-
              onds  later  than the estimated duration. This value will not be
              included if the job execution has reached a terminal status.
