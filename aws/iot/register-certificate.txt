REGISTER-CERTIFICATE()                                  REGISTER-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       register-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers a device certificate with IoT in the same certificate mode as
       the signing CA. If you have more than one CA certificate that  has  the
       same  subject  field, you must specify the CA certificate that was used
       to sign the device certificate being registered.

       Requires permission to access the RegisterCertificate action.

OPTIONS
       --certificate-pem (string)
          The certificate data, in PEM format.

       --ca-certificate-pem (string)
          The CA certificate used to sign the device certificate being  regis-
          tered.

       --set-as-active | --no-set-as-active (boolean)
          A boolean value that specifies if the certificate is set to active.

          Valid values: ACTIVE | INACTIVE

       --status (string)
          The  status  of  the register certificate request. Valid values that
          you can use include ACTIVE , INACTIVE , and REVOKED .

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

          o REVOKED

          o PENDING_TRANSFER

          o REGISTER_INACTIVE

          o PENDING_ACTIVATION

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To register a self signed device certificate

       The following register-certificate example registers the deviceCert.pem
       device certificate signed by the rootCA.pem CA certificate. The CA cer-
       tificate must be registered before you use it to register a self-signed
       device  certificate.  The self-signed certificate must be signed by the
       same CA certificate you pass to this command.

          aws iot register-certificate \
              --certificate-pem file://deviceCert.pem \
              --ca-certificate-pem file://rootCA.pem

       Output:

          {
              "certificateArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:cert/488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142",
              "certificateId": "488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142"
           }

       ence.

OUTPUT
       certificateArn -> (string)
          The certificate ARN.

       certificateId -> (string)
          The certificate identifier.
