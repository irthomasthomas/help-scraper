REGISTER-CERTIFICATE()                                  REGISTER-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       register-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers a device certificate with IoT in the same certificate mode as
       the signing CA. If you have more than one CA certificate that  has  the
       same  subject  field, you must specify the CA certificate that was used
       to sign the device certificate being registered.

       Requires permission to access the RegisterCertificate action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-certificate
          --certificate-pem <value>
          [--ca-certificate-pem <value>]
          [--set-as-active | --no-set-as-active]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-pem (string)
          The certificate data, in PEM format.

       --ca-certificate-pem (string)
          The CA certificate used to sign the device certificate being  regis-
          tered.

       --set-as-active | --no-set-as-active (boolean)
          A boolean value that specifies if the certificate is set to active.

          Valid values: ACTIVE | INACTIVE

       --status (string)
          The  status  of  the register certificate request. Valid values that
          you can use include ACTIVE , INACTIVE , and REVOKED .

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

          o REVOKED

          o PENDING_TRANSFER

          o REGISTER_INACTIVE

          o PENDING_ACTIVATION

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To register a self signed device certificate

       The following register-certificate example registers the deviceCert.pem
       device certificate signed by the rootCA.pem CA certificate. The CA cer-
       tificate must be registered before you use it to register a self-signed
       device  certificate.  The self-signed certificate must be signed by the
       same CA certificate you pass to this command.

          aws iot register-certificate \
              --certificate-pem file://deviceCert.pem \
              --ca-certificate-pem file://rootCA.pem

       Output:

          {
              "certificateArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:cert/488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142",
              "certificateId": "488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142"
           }

OUTPUT
       certificateArn -> (string)
          The certificate ARN.

       certificateId -> (string)
          The certificate identifier.
