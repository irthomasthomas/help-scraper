LIST-PRINCIPAL-THINGS()                                LIST-PRINCIPAL-THINGS()



NAME
       list-principal-things -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  things associated with the specified principal. A principal
       can be X.509 certificates, IAM users, groups, and roles, Amazon Cognito
       identities or federated identities.

       Requires permission to access the ListPrincipalThings action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-principal-things  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: things

SYNOPSIS
            list-principal-things
          --principal <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --principal (string)
          The principal.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the things attached with a principal

       The  following  list-principal-things example lists the things attached
       to the principal specified by an ARN.

          aws iot list-principal-things \
              --principal arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:cert/2e1eb273792174ec2b9bf4e9b37e6c6c692345499506002a35159767055278e8

       Output:

          {
              "things": [
                  "DeskLamp",
                  "TableLamp"
              ]
          }

       ence.

OUTPUT
       things -> (list)
          The things.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to  use to get the next set of results, or null if there
          are no additional results.
