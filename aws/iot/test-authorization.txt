TEST-AUTHORIZATION()                                      TEST-AUTHORIZATION()



NAME
       test-authorization -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests  if  a specified principal is authorized to perform an IoT action
       on a specified resource. Use this to test and debug  the  authorization
       behavior of devices that connect to the IoT device gateway.

       Requires permission to access the TestAuthorization action.

OPTIONS
       --principal (string)
          The  principal. Valid principals are CertificateArn (arn:aws:iot:re-
          gion     :accountId     :cert/certificateId     ),     thingGroupArn
          (arn:aws:iot:region :accountId :thinggroup/groupName ) and CognitoId
          (region :id ).

       --cognito-identity-pool-id (string)
          The Cognito identity pool ID.

       --auth-infos (list)
          A list of authorization info objects. Simulating authorization  will
          create a response for each authInfo object in the list.

          (structure)
              A collection of authorization information.

              actionType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  action for which the principal is being autho-
                 rized.

              resources -> (list)
                 The resources for which the principal is being authorized  to
                 perform the specified action.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          actionType=string,resources=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "actionType": "PUBLISH"|"SUBSCRIBE"|"RECEIVE"|"CONNECT",
              "resources": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-id (string)
          The MQTT client ID.

       --policy-names-to-add (list)
          When  testing  custom authorization, the policies specified here are
          treated as if they are attached to the principal being authorized.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --policy-names-to-skip (list)
          When testing custom authorization, the policies specified  here  are
          treated  as  if  they are not attached to the principal being autho-
          rized.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To test your AWS IoT policies

       The following test-authorization example tests the AWS IoT policies as-
       sociated with the specified principal.
