LIST-CERTIFICATES()                                        LIST-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       list-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the certificates registered in your Amazon Web Services account.

       The  results  are paginated with a default page size of 25. You can use
       the returned marker to retrieve additional results.

       Requires permission to access the ListCertificates action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-certificates is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: certificates

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --ascending-order | --no-ascending-order (boolean)
          Specifies the order for results. If True, the results  are  returned
          in ascending order, based on the creation date.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list the certificates registered in your AWS account

       The following list-certificates example lists all  certificates  regis-
       tered  in  your account. If you have more than the default paging limit
       of 25, you can use the nextMarker response value from this command  and
       supply  it to the next command to get the next batch of results. Repeat
       until nextMarker returns without a value.

OUTPUT
       certificates -> (list)
          The descriptions of the certificates.

          (structure)
              Information about a certificate.

              certificateArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the certificate.

              certificateId -> (string)
                 The ID of the certificate. (The last part of the  certificate
                 ARN contains the certificate ID.)

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the certificate.

                 The  status  value REGISTER_INACTIVE is deprecated and should
                 not be used.

              certificateMode -> (string)
                 The mode of the certificate.
                     DEFAULT : A certificate in DEFAULT mode is either  gener-
                     ated  by  Amazon Web Services IoT Core or registered with
                     an issuer certificate authority (CA) in DEFAULT mode. De-
                     vices  with  certificates in DEFAULT mode aren't required
                     to send the Server Name Indication (SNI)  extension  when
                     connecting  to  Amazon Web Services IoT Core. However, to
                     use features such as custom domains and VPC endpoints, we
                     recommend  that you use the SNI extension when connecting
                     to Amazon Web Services IoT Core.

                     SNI_ONLY : A certificate in SNI_ONLY mode  is  registered
                     without  an  issuer  CA.  Devices  with  certificates  in
                     SNI_ONLY mode must send the SNI extension when connecting
                     to Amazon Web Services IoT Core.

              creationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the certificate was created.

       nextMarker -> (string)
          The  marker for the next set of results, or null if there are no ad-
          ditional results.



                                                           LIST-CERTIFICATES()
