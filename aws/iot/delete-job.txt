DELETE-JOB()                                                      DELETE-JOB()



NAME
       delete-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a job and its related job executions.

       Deleting a job may take time, depending on the number of job executions
       created for the job and various other factors. While the job  is  being
       deleted, the status of the job will be shown as "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS".
       Attempting to delete or cancel a job whose  status  is  already  "DELE-
       TION_IN_PROGRESS" will result in an error.

       Only  10  jobs may have status "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS" at the same time,
       or a LimitExceededException will occur.

       Requires permission to access the DeleteJob action.

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the job to be deleted.

          After a job deletion is completed, you may reuse this jobId when you
          create a new job. However, this is not recommended, and you must en-
          sure that your devices are not using  the  jobId  to  refer  to  the
          deleted job.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          (Optional)  When  true, you can delete a job which is "IN_PROGRESS".
          Otherwise, you can only delete a job which is in  a  terminal  state
          ("COMPLETED"  or "CANCELED") or an exception will occur. The default
          is false.

          NOTE:
              Deleting a job which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause a device which
              is  executing  the job to be unable to access job information or
              update the job execution status. Use  caution  and  ensure  that
              each  device executing a job which is deleted is able to recover
              to a valid state.

       --namespace-id (string)
          The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

          When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT
          Core  sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the value
          in the following format.
              $aws/things/*THING_NAME* /jobs/*JOB_ID* /notify-namespace-*NAME-
              SPACE_ID* /

          NOTE:
              The  namespaceId  feature is only supported by IoT Greengrass at
              this time. For more information, see Setting up  IoT  Greengrass
              core devices.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a job

       The following delete-job example deletes the specified job. By specify-
       ing  the  --force  option,  the  job  is  deleted even if the status is
       IN_PROGRESS.

          aws iot delete-job \
              --job-id "example-job-04" \
              --force

       This command produces no output.

       IoT Developer Guide.
