OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get detailed status for a job

       The  following  describe-job  example  gets detailed status for the job
       whose ID is example-job-01.

          aws iot describe-job \
              --job-id "example-job-01"

OUTPUT
       documentSource -> (string)
          An S3 link to the job document.

       job -> (structure)
          Information about the job.

          jobArn -> (string)
              An  ARN  identifying the job with format "arn:aws:iot:region:ac-
              count:job/jobId".

          jobId -> (string)
              The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was  cre-
              ated.

          targetSelection -> (string)
              Specifies  whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or
              will be complete after all those  things  specified  as  targets
              have  completed  the  job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may
              also be run on a thing when a change is detected  in  a  target.
              For  example,  a  job will run on a device when the thing repre-
              senting the device is added to a target group,  even  after  the
              job was completed by all things originally in the group.

              NOTE:
                 We recommend that you use continuous jobs instead of snapshot
                 jobs for dynamic thing group  targets.  By  using  continuous
                 jobs,  devices  that join the group receive the job execution
                 even after the job has been created.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the job, one of IN_PROGRESS  ,  CANCELED  ,  DELE-
              TION_IN_PROGRESS or COMPLETED .

          forceCanceled -> (boolean)
              Will be true if the job was canceled with the optional force pa-
              rameter set to true .

          reasonCode -> (string)
              If the job was updated, provides the reason code for the update.

          comment -> (string)
              If the job was updated, describes the reason for the update.

          targets -> (list)
              A list of IoT things and thing groups to which the job should be
              sent.

              (string)

          description -> (string)
              A short text description of the job.

          presignedUrlConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration for pre-signed S3 URLs.

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  an  IAM role that grants permission to download
                 files from the S3  bucket  where  the  job  data/updates  are
                 stored.  The role must also grant permission for IoT to down-
                 load the files.

                 WARNING:
                     For information  about  addressing  the  confused  deputy
                     problem,  see cross-service confused deputy prevention in
                     the Amazon Web Services IoT Core developer guide .

              expiresInSec -> (long)
                 How long (in seconds) pre-signed URLs are valid. Valid values
                 are  60 - 3600, the default value is 3600 seconds. Pre-signed
                 URLs are generated when Jobs receives an MQTT request for the
                 job document.

          jobExecutionsRolloutConfig -> (structure)

                     pending job, per minute at the start of job rollout. This
                     parameter allows you to define the initial rate of  roll-
                     out.

                 incrementFactor -> (double)
                     The  exponential  factor  to increase the rate of rollout
                     for a job.

                     Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up to one digit af-
                     ter the decimal (for example, 1.5, but not 1.55).

                 rateIncreaseCriteria -> (structure)

                     takes place.

                     failureType -> (string)
                        The type of job execution failures that can initiate a
                        job abort.

                     action -> (string)
                        The  type  of  job  action to take to initiate the job
                        abort.

                     thresholdPercentage -> (double)
                        The minimum percentage of job execution failures  that
                        must occur to initiate the job abort.

                        Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up to two digits
                        after the decimal (for example, 10.9  and  10.99,  but

              processingTargets -> (list)
                 The target devices to which the job execution is being rolled
                 out. This value will be null after the job execution has fin-
                 ished rolling out to all the target devices.

                 (string)

              numberOfCanceledThings -> (integer)
                 The number of things that cancelled the job.

              numberOfQueuedThings -> (integer)
                 The number of things that are awaiting execution of the job.

              numberOfInProgressThings -> (integer)
                 The number of things currently executing the job.

              numberOfRemovedThings -> (integer)
                 The number of things that are no longer scheduled to  execute
                 the  job  because they have been deleted or have been removed
                 from the group that was a target of the job.

              numberOfTimedOutThings -> (integer)
                 The number of things whose job execution status is  TIMED_OUT
                 .

          timeoutConfig -> (structure)
              Specifies  the amount of time each device has to finish its exe-
              cution of the job. A timer is started  when  the  job  execution
              status  is  set  to IN_PROGRESS . If the job execution status is
              not set to another terminal state before the timer  expires,  it
              will be automatically set to TIMED_OUT .

              inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
                 Specifies  the amount of time, in minutes, this device has to
                 finish execution of this job. The  timeout  interval  can  be
                 anywhere  between  1  minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes).
                 The in progress timer can't be updated and will apply to  all
                 job  executions for the job. Whenever a job execution remains
                 in the IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval,  the
                 job  execution will fail and switch to the terminal TIMED_OUT
                 status.

          namespaceId -> (string)
              The namespace used to indicate that a job is a  customer-managed
              job.

              When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services
              IoT Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT  topics  that  contain
              the value in the following format.
                 $aws/things/*THING_NAME*     /jobs/*JOB_ID*     /notify-name-
                 space-*NAMESPACE_ID* /

              NOTE:
                 The namespaceId feature is only supported by  IoT  Greengrass
                 at this time. For more information, see Setting up IoT Green-
                 grass core devices.

                 The list of criteria that determines how many retries are al-
                 lowed for each failure type for a job.

                 (structure)
                     The criteria that determines how many retries are allowed
                     for each failure type for a job.

                     failureType -> (string)
                        The type of job execution failures that can initiate a
                        job retry.

                     numberOfRetries -> (integer)
                        The  number  of retries allowed for a failure type for
                        the job.

          documentParameters -> (map)
              A key-value map that pairs the patterns that need to be replaced
              in  a  managed template job document schema. You can use the de-
              scription of each key as a guidance to specify the inputs during
              runtime when creating a job.

              NOTE:
                 documentParameters  can  only be used when creating jobs from
                 Amazon Web Services managed templates. This  parameter  can't
                 be  used  with  custom  job  templates or to create jobs from
                 them.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          isConcurrent -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether a job is concurrent. Will be true when  a  job
              is  rolling  out new job executions or canceling previously cre-
              ated executions, otherwise false.

          schedulingConfig -> (structure)
              The configuration that allows you to schedule a job for a future
              date  and  time  in  addition to specifying the end behavior for
              each job execution.

              startTime -> (string)
                 The time a job will begin rollout of the job document to  all
                 devices  in  the target group for a job. The startTime can be
                 scheduled up to a year in advance and  must  be  scheduled  a
                 minimum of thirty minutes from the current time. The date and
                 time format for the startTime is YYYY-MM-DD for the date  and

              endTime -> (string)
                 The time a job will stop rollout of the job document  to  all
                 devices  in the target group for a job. The endTime must take
                 place no later than two years from the current  time  and  be
                 scheduled  a minimum of thirty minutes from the current time.
                 The minimum duration between startTime and endTime is  thirty
                 minutes.  The  maximum duration between startTime and endTime
                 is two years. The date and time format  for  the  endTime  is
                 YYYY-MM-DD for the date and HH:MM for the time.
