LIST-TOPIC-RULE-DESTINATIONS()                  LIST-TOPIC-RULE-DESTINATIONS()



NAME
       list-topic-rule-destinations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the topic rule destinations in your Amazon Web Services ac-
       count.

       Requires permission to access the ListTopicRuleDestinations action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-topic-rule-destinations is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: destinationSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-topic-rule-destinations
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list your topic rule destinations

       The following list-topic-rule-destinations example lists all topic rule
       destinations that you have defined in the current AWS Region.

          aws iot list-topic-rule-destinations

       Output:

          {
              "destinationSummaries": [
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:ruledestination/http/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
                      "status": "ENABLED",
                      "httpUrlSummary": {
                          "confirmationUrl": "https://example.com"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       AWS IoT Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       destinationSummaries -> (list)
          Information about a topic rule destination.

          (structure)
              Information about the topic rule destination.

              arn -> (string)
                 The topic rule destination ARN.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the topic rule destination. Valid values are:
                     IN_PROGRESS

                 A topic rule destination was created but has  not  been  con-
                 firmed.  You can set status to IN_PROGRESS by calling Update-
                 TopicRuleDestination  .  Calling   UpdateTopicRuleDestination
                 causes  a  new confirmation challenge to be sent to your con-
                 firmation endpoint.
                     ENABLED

                 Confirmation was completed, and traffic to  this  destination
                 is allowed. You can set status to DISABLED by calling Update-
                 TopicRuleDestination .
                     DISABLED

                 Confirmation was completed, and traffic to  this  destination
                 is  not allowed. You can set status to ENABLED by calling Up-
                 dateTopicRuleDestination .
                     ERROR

                 Confirmation could not be completed, for example if the  con-
                 firmation timed out. You can call GetTopicRuleDestination for
                 details about the error. You can set status to IN_PROGRESS by
                 calling   UpdateTopicRuleDestination  .  Calling  UpdateTopi-
                 cRuleDestination causes a new confirmation  challenge  to  be
                 sent to your confirmation endpoint.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time when the topic rule destination was cre-
                 ated.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the topic rule  destination  was  last
                 updated.

              statusReason -> (string)
                 The  reason the topic rule destination is in the current sta-
                 tus.

              httpUrlSummary -> (structure)
                 Information about the HTTP URL.

                     The URL used to confirm ownership of  or  access  to  the
                     HTTP topic rule destination URL.

              vpcDestinationSummary -> (structure)
                 Information about the virtual private cloud (VPC) connection.

                 subnetIds -> (list)
                     The subnet IDs of the VPC destination.

                     (string)

                 securityGroups -> (list)
