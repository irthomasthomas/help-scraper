LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists jobs.

       Requires permission to access the ListJobs action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: jobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-jobs
          [--status <value>]
          [--target-selection <value>]
          [--thing-group-name <value>]
          [--thing-group-id <value>]
          [--namespace-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          An optional filter that lets you search for jobs that have the spec-
          ified status.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o CANCELED

          o COMPLETED

          o DELETION_IN_PROGRESS

       --target-selection (string)
          Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will
          be complete after all those things specified as  targets  have  com-
          pleted the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on
          a thing when a change is detected in a target. For  example,  a  job
          will  run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group, even
          after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.

          NOTE:
              We recommend that you use continuous jobs  instead  of  snapshot
              jobs  for dynamic thing group targets. By using continuous jobs,
              devices that join the group receive the job execution even after
              the job has been created.

          Possible values:

          o CONTINUOUS

          o SNAPSHOT

       --thing-group-name (string)
          A  filter  that  limits the returned jobs to those for the specified
          group.

       --thing-group-id (string)
          A filter that limits the returned jobs to those  for  the  specified
          group.

       --namespace-id (string)
          The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

          When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT
          Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the  value
          in the following format.
              $aws/things/*THING_NAME* /jobs/*JOB_ID* /notify-namespace-*NAME-
              SPACE_ID* /

          NOTE:
              The namespaceId feature is in public preview.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the jobs in your AWS account

       The following list-jobs example lists all jobs  in  your  AWS  account,
       sorted by the job status.

          aws iot list-jobs

       Output:

          {
              "jobs": [
                  {
                      "jobArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:job/example-job-01",
                      "jobId": "example-job-01",
                      "targetSelection": "SNAPSHOT",
                      "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
                      "createdAt": 1560787022.733,
                      "lastUpdatedAt": 1560787026.294
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       jobs -> (list)
          A list of jobs.

          (structure)
              The job summary.

              jobArn -> (string)
                 The job ARN.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier you assigned to this job  when  it  was
                 created.

              thingGroupId -> (string)
                 The ID of the thing group.

              targetSelection -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS),
                 or will be complete after all those things specified as  tar-
                 gets  have  completed  the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the
                 job may also be run on a thing when a change is detected in a
                 target. For example, a job will run on a thing when the thing
                 is added to a target group, even after the job was  completed
                 by all things originally in the group.

                 NOTE:
                     We  recommend  that  you  use  continuous jobs instead of
                     snapshot jobs for dynamic thing group targets.  By  using
                     continuous  jobs, devices that join the group receive the
                     job execution even after the job has been created.

                 The job summary status.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job  was  cre-
                 ated.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time,  in seconds since the epoch, when the job was last
                 updated.

              completedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job completed.

              isConcurrent -> (boolean)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no addi-
          tional results.
