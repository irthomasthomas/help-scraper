LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists jobs.

       Requires permission to access the ListJobs action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: jobs

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          An optional filter that lets you search for jobs that have the spec-
          ified status.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o CANCELED

          o COMPLETED

          o DELETION_IN_PROGRESS

          o SCHEDULED

       --target-selection (string)
          Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will
          be complete after all those things specified as  targets  have  com-
          pleted the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on
          a thing when a change is detected in a target. For  example,  a  job
          will  run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group, even
          after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.

          NOTE:
              We recommend that you use continuous jobs  instead  of  snapshot
              jobs  for dynamic thing group targets. By using continuous jobs,
              devices that join the group receive the job execution even after
              the job has been created.

          Possible values:

          o CONTINUOUS

          o SNAPSHOT

       --thing-group-name (string)
          A  filter  that  limits the returned jobs to those for the specified
          group.

       --thing-group-id (string)
          A filter that limits the returned jobs to those  for  the  specified
          group.

       --namespace-id (string)
          The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

          When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT
          Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the  value
          in the following format.
              $aws/things/*THING_NAME* /jobs/*JOB_ID* /notify-namespace-*NAME-
              SPACE_ID* /

          NOTE:
              The namespaceId feature is only supported by IoT  Greengrass  at
              this  time.  For more information, see Setting up IoT Greengrass
              core devices.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the jobs in your AWS account

       The  following  list-jobs  example  lists all jobs in your AWS account,
       sorted by the job status.

          aws iot list-jobs

       Output:

          {
              "jobs": [
                  {
                      "jobArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:job/example-job-01",
                      "jobId": "example-job-01",
                      "targetSelection": "SNAPSHOT",
                      "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
                      "createdAt": 1560787022.733,
                      "lastUpdatedAt": 1560787026.294
                  }
              ]
          }

       IoT Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       jobs -> (list)
          A list of jobs.

          (structure)
              The job summary.

              jobArn -> (string)
                 The job ARN.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  you assigned to this job when it was
                 created.

              thingGroupId -> (string)
                 The ID of the thing group.

              targetSelection -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the job will continue to run  (CONTINUOUS),
                 or  will be complete after all those things specified as tar-
                 gets have completed the job (SNAPSHOT).  If  continuous,  the
                 job may also be run on a thing when a change is detected in a
                 target. For example, a job will run on a thing when the thing
                 is  added to a target group, even after the job was completed
                 by all things originally in the group.

                 NOTE:
                     We recommend that you  use  continuous  jobs  instead  of
                     snapshot  jobs  for dynamic thing group targets. By using
                     continuous jobs, devices that join the group receive  the
                     job execution even after the job has been created.

                 ated.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job  was  last
                 updated.

              completedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job completed.

              isConcurrent -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  a  job is concurrent. Will be true when a
                 job is rolling out new job executions or canceling previously
                 created executions, otherwise false.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no addi-
          tional results.
