OPTIONS
       --job-template-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the job template.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                 see cross-service confused deputy prevention  in  the  Amazon
                 Web Services IoT Core developer guide .

          expiresInSec -> (long)
              How  long  (in  seconds) pre-signed URLs are valid. Valid values
              are 60 - 3600, the default value  is  3600  seconds.  Pre-signed
              URLs  are  generated  when Jobs receives an MQTT request for the
              job document.

       jobExecutionsRolloutConfig -> (structure)
          Allows you to create a staged rollout of a job.

          maximumPerMinute -> (integer)
              The maximum number of things that will be notified of a  pending
              job,  per  minute.  This parameter allows you to create a staged
              rollout.

          exponentialRate -> (structure)
              The rate of increase for a job rollout.  This  parameter  allows

                 The minimum number of things that will be notified of a pend-
                 ing job, per minute at the start of job rollout. This parame-
                 ter allows you to define the initial rate of rollout.

              incrementFactor -> (double)
                 The  exponential factor to increase the rate of rollout for a
                 job.

                 Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up to one  digit  after
                 the decimal (for example, 1.5, but not 1.55).

                 The  criteria to initiate the increase in rate of rollout for
                 a job.

                 numberOfNotifiedThings -> (integer)
                     The threshold for number of  notified  things  that  will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

                 numberOfSucceededThings -> (integer)
                     The  threshold  for  number of succeeded things that will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

       abortConfig -> (structure)
          The criteria that determine when and how a job abort takes place.

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The list of criteria that determine when and how  to  abort  the
              job.

              (structure)
                 The  criteria  that  determine when and how a job abort takes
                 place.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The type of job execution failures that  can  initiate  a
                     job abort.

                 action -> (string)

                 thresholdPercentage -> (double)
                     The  minimum  percentage  of  job execution failures that
                     must occur to initiate the job abort.

                     Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up  to  two  digits
                     after  the  decimal (for example, 10.9 and 10.99, but not
                     10.999).

                 minNumberOfExecutedThings -> (integer)
                     The minimum number of things which must receive job  exe-
                     cution notifications before the job can be aborted.

       timeoutConfig -> (structure)
          Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution
          of the job. A timer is started when the job execution status is  set
          to  IN_PROGRESS  . If the job execution status is not set to another
          terminal state before the timer expires, it  will  be  automatically
          set to TIMED_OUT .

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
              Specifies  the  amount  of  time, in minutes, this device has to
              finish execution of this job. The timeout interval can  be  any-
              where  between  1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes). The in
              progress timer can't be updated and will apply to all job execu-
              tions  for  the  job.  Whenever  a  job execution remains in the
              IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval, the job execu-
              tion will fail and switch to the terminal TIMED_OUT status.

          The  configuration  that determines how many retries are allowed for
          each failure type for a job.

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The list of criteria that determines how many  retries  are  al-
              lowed for each failure type for a job.

                 The criteria that determines how many retries are allowed for
                 each failure type for a job.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The type of job execution failures that  can  initiate  a
                     job retry.

                 numberOfRetries -> (integer)
                     The  number of retries allowed for a failure type for the
                     job.

       maintenanceWindows -> (list)
          Allows you to configure an optional maintenance window for the roll-
          out of a job document to all devices in the target group for a job.

          (structure)
              An optional configuration within the SchedulingConfig to setup a
              recurring maintenance window with a predetermined start time and
              duration  for  the rollout of a job document to all devices in a
              target group for a job.

              startTime -> (string)
                 Displays the start time of the next maintenance window.

              durationInMinutes -> (integer)
                 Displays the duration of the next maintenance window.

       destinationPackageVersions -> (list)
          The package version Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that are  installed
          on the device when the job successfully completes.
              Note:  The  following  Length  Constraints  relates  to a single
              string. Up to five strings are allowed.
