OPTIONS
       --frequency (string)
          How often the scheduled audit takes place, either DAILY ,  WEEKLY  ,
          BIWEEKLY  ,  or MONTHLY . The start time of each audit is determined

          o WEEKLY

          o BIWEEKLY

          o MONTHLY

          The day of the month on which the scheduled audit takes place.  This
          can  be  1  through  31 or LAST . This field is required if the fre-
          quency parameter is set to MONTHLY . If days  29-31  are  specified,
          and the month does not have that many days, the audit takes place on
          the "LAST" day of the month.

       --day-of-week (string)
          The day of the week on which the scheduled audit takes  place.  This
          can  be  one  of  SUN  , MON , TUE , WED , THU , FRI , or SAT . This
          field is required if the "frequency" parameter is set to  WEEKLY  or
          BIWEEKLY .

          Possible values:

          o SUN

          o MON

       --target-check-names (list)
          Which  checks  are performed during the scheduled audit. Checks must
          be enabled for your account. (Use  DescribeAccountAuditConfiguration
          to  see  the list of all checks, including those that are enabled or
          use UpdateAccountAuditConfiguration to select which checks  are  en-
          abled.)

          (string)
              An  audit  check  name. Checks must be enabled for your account.
              (Use DescribeAccountAuditConfiguration to see the  list  of  all
              checks, including those that are enabled or use UpdateAccountAu-
              ditConfiguration to select which checks are enabled.)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --scheduled-audit-name (string)
          The name of the scheduled audit. (Max. 128 chars)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a scheduled audit definition

       The following update-scheduled-audit example changes the  target  check
       names for an AWS IoT Device Defender scheduled audit.

          aws iot update-scheduled-audit \
              --scheduled-audit-name WednesdayCertCheck \
              --target-check-names CA_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRING_CHECK DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRING_CHECK REVOKED_CA_CERTIFICATE_STILL_ACTIVE_CHECK

       Output:

          {
              "scheduledAuditArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:scheduledaudit/WednesdayCertCheck"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Audit  Commands  in the AWS IoT Developer
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       scheduledAuditArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the scheduled audit.
