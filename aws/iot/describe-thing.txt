OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To display detailed information about a thing

       The following describe-thing example display information about a  thing
       (device) that is defined in the AWS IoT registry for your AWS account.

          aws iot describe-thing
                 --thing-name "MyLightBulb"

       Output:

          {
              "defaultClientId": "MyLightBulb",
              "thingName": "MyLightBulb",
              "thingId": "40da2e73-c6af-406e-b415-15acae538797",
              "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/MyLightBulb",
              "thingTypeName": "LightBulb",
              "attributes": {
                  "model": "123",
                  "wattage": "75"
              },
              "version": 1
          }

       For more information, see How to Manage Things with the Registry in the
       AWS IoT Developers Guide.

OUTPUT
       defaultClientId -> (string)
          The default MQTT client ID. For a typical device, the thing name  is
          also  used as the default MQTT client ID. Although we dont require a
          mapping between a thing's registry name and its use of  MQTT  client
          IDs,  certificates,  or shadow state, we recommend that you choose a
          thing name and use it as the MQTT client ID for the registry and the
          Device Shadow service.

          This  lets  you  better organize your IoT fleet without removing the
          flexibility of the underlying device certificate model or shadows.

       thingName -> (string)
          The name of the thing.

       thingId -> (string)
          The ID of the thing to describe.

       thingArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the thing to describe.

       thingTypeName -> (string)
          The thing type name.

       attributes -> (map)
          The thing attributes.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       version -> (long)
          The current version of the thing record in the registry.

          NOTE:
              To avoid unintentional changes to the information  in  the  reg-
              istry,  you can pass the version information in the expectedVer-
              sion parameter of the UpdateThing and DeleteThing calls.

       billingGroupName -> (string)
          The name of the billing group the thing belongs to.
