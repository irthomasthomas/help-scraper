OPTIONS
       --metric-name (string)
          The name of the custom metric. This will be used in the  metric  re-
          port submitted from the device/thing. The name can't begin with aws:
          . You can't change the name after you define it.

       --display-name (string)
          The friendly name in the console for the custom  metric.  This  name
          doesn't have to be unique. Don't use this name as the metric identi-
          fier in the device metric report. You can update the  friendly  name
          after you define it.

       --metric-type (string)
          The type of the custom metric.

          WARNING:
              The  type  number  only takes a single metric value as an input,
              but when you submit the metrics value in the  DeviceMetrics  re-
              port, you must pass it as an array with a single value.

          Possible values:

          o string-list

          o ip-address-list

          o number-list

          o number

       --tags (list)
          Metadata that can be used to manage the custom metric.

          (structure)
              A set of key/value pairs that are used to manage the resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-request-token (string)
          Each  custom  metric must have a unique client request token. If you
          try to create a new custom metric that already exists with a differ-
          ent  token,  an exception occurs. If you omit this value, Amazon Web
          Services SDKs will automatically generate a unique client request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a custom metric published by your devices to Device Defender

       The following create-custom-metric example creates a custom metric that
       measures battery percentage.

          aws iot create-custom-metric \
              --metric-name "batteryPercentage" \
              --metric-type "number" \
              --display-name "Remaining battery percentage." \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --client-request-token "02ccb92b-33e8-4dfa-a0c1-35b181ed26b0"

       Output:

          {
              "metricName": "batteryPercentage",
              "metricArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:1234564789012:custommetric/batteryPercentage"
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       metricName -> (string)
          The name of the custom metric to be used in the metric report.

       metricArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the custom metric. For example,
          ``
          arn:aws-partition :iot:region :accountId :custommetric/metricName ``
