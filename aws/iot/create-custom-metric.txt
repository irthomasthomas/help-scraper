NAME
       create-custom-metric -

DESCRIPTION
       Use this API to define a Custom Metric published by your devices to De-
       vice Defender.

       Requires permission to access the CreateCustomMetric action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-custom-metric
          --metric-name <value>
          [--display-name <value>]
          --metric-type <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --metric-name (string)
          The name of the custom metric. This will be used in the  metric  re-
          port submitted from the device/thing. The name can't begin with aws:
          . You can't change the name after you define it.

       --display-name (string)
          The friendly name in the console for the custom  metric.  This  name
          doesn't have to be unique. Don't use this name as the metric identi-
          fier in the device metric report. You can update the  friendly  name
          after you define it.

       --metric-type (string)
          The type of the custom metric.

          WARNING:
              The  type  number  only takes a single metric value as an input,
              but when you submit the metrics value in the  DeviceMetrics  re-
              port, you must pass it as an array with a single value.

          Possible values:

          o string-list

          o ip-address-list

          o number-list

          o number

       --tags (list)
          Metadata that can be used to manage the custom metric.

          (structure)
              A set of key/value pairs that are used to manage the resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-request-token (string)
          Each  custom  metric must have a unique client request token. If you
          try to create a new custom metric that already exists with a differ-
          ent  token,  an exception occurs. If you omit this value, Amazon Web
          Services SDKs will automatically generate a unique client request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a custom metric published by your devices to Device Defender

       The following create-custom-metric example creates a custom metric that
       measures battery percentage.

          aws iot create-custom-metric \
              --metric-name "batteryPercentage" \
              --metric-type "number" \
              --display-name "Remaining battery percentage." \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --client-request-token "02ccb92b-33e8-4dfa-a0c1-35b181ed26b0"

       Output:

          {
              "metricName": "batteryPercentage",
              "metricArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:1234564789012:custommetric/batteryPercentage"
          }

       For  more information, see Custom metrics in the AWS IoT Core Developer
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       metricName -> (string)
          The name of the custom metric to be used in the metric report.

       metricArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the custom metric. For example,
          ``
          arn:aws-partition :iot:region :accountId :custommetric/metricName ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 233)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.
