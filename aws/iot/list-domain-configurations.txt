LIST-DOMAIN-CONFIGURATIONS()                      LIST-DOMAIN-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       list-domain-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a list of domain configurations for the user. This list is sorted
       alphabetically by domain configuration name.

       Requires permission to access the ListDomainConfigurations action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-domain-configurations is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: domainConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            list-domain-configurations
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--service-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --service-type (string)
          The type of service delivered by the endpoint.

          Possible values:

          o DATA

          o CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER

          o JOBS

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list domain configurations

       The following list-domain-configurations example lists the domain  con-
       figurations in your AWS account that have the specified service type.

          aws iot list-domain-configurations \
              --service-type "DATA"

       Output:

          {
              "domainConfigurations":
              [
                  {
                      "domainConfigurationName": "additionalDataDomain",
                      "domainConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:domainconfiguration/additionalDataDomain/dikMh",
                      "serviceType": "DATA"
                  },

                  {
                      "domainConfigurationName": "iot:Jobs",
                      "domainConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:domainconfiguration/iot:Jobs",
                      "serviceType": "JOBS"
                  },
                  {
                      "domainConfigurationName": "iot:Data-ATS",
                      "domainConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:domainconfiguration/iot:Data-ATS",
                      "serviceType": "DATA"
                  },
                  {
                      "domainConfigurationName": "iot:CredentialProvider",
                      "domainConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:domainconfiguration/iot:CredentialProvider",
                      "serviceType": "CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER"

OUTPUT
       domainConfigurations -> (list)
          A list of objects that contain summary information about the  user's
          domain configurations.

          (structure)
              The  summary  of  a domain configuration. A domain configuration
              specifies custom IoT-specific information about a domain. A  do-
              main  configuration  can  be  associated with an Amazon Web Ser-
              vices-managed      domain      (for      example,      dbc123de-
              fghijk.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com),  a customer managed domain,
              or a default endpoint.

              o Data

              o Jobs

              o CredentialProvider

              domainConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The name of the domain  configuration.  This  value  must  be
                 unique to a region.

              domainConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the domain configuration.

              serviceType -> (string)
                 The type of service delivered by the endpoint.

       nextMarker -> (string)
          The marker for the next set of results.
