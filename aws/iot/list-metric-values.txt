LIST-METRIC-VALUES()                                      LIST-METRIC-VALUES()



NAME
       list-metric-values -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  values  reported  for  an  IoT  Device Defender metric (de-
       vice-side metric, cloud-side metric, or custom  metric)  by  the  given
       thing during the specified time period.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-metric-values  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: metricDatumList

SYNOPSIS
            list-metric-values
          --thing-name <value>
          --metric-name <value>
          [--dimension-name <value>]
          [--dimension-value-operator <value>]
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing for which security profile metric  values  are
          returned.

       --metric-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  security profile metric for which values are re-
          turned.

       --dimension-name (string)
          The dimension name.

       --dimension-value-operator (string)
          The dimension value operator.

          Possible values:

          o IN

          o NOT_IN

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time period for which metric values are returned.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time period for which metric values are returned.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       metricDatumList -> (list)
          The data the thing reports for the metric during the specified  time
          period.

          (structure)
              A metric.

              timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time the metric value was reported.

              value -> (structure)
                 The value reported for the metric.

                 count -> (long)
                     If  the comparisonOperator calls for a numeric value, use
                     this to specify that numeric value to  be  compared  with
                     the metric .

                 cidrs -> (list)
                     If  the  comparisonOperator calls for a set of CIDRs, use
                     this to specify that set to be compared with the metric .

                     (string)

                 ports -> (list)
                     If the comparisonOperator calls for a set of  ports,  use
                     this to specify that set to be compared with the metric .

                     (integer)

                 number -> (double)
                     The numeral value of a metric.

                 numbers -> (list)
                     The numeral values of a metric.

                     (double)

                 strings -> (list)
                     The string values of a metric.

                     (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  can  be used to retrieve the next set of results, or
          null if there are no additional results.
