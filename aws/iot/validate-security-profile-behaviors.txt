OPTIONS
       --behaviors (list)
          Specifies the behaviors that, when violated  by  a  device  (thing),
          cause an alert.

          (structure)
              A Device Defender security profile behavior.

              name -> (string)
                 The name you've given to the behavior.

              metric -> (string)
                 What is measured by the behavior.

              metricDimension -> (structure)
                 The dimension for a metric in your behavior. For example, us-
                 ing a TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow down  the  scope
                 of  the metric to only MQTT topics where the name matches the
                 pattern specified in the dimension. This can't be  used  with
                 custom metrics.

                 dimensionName -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the dimension.

                 operator -> (string)
                     Defines how the dimensionValues of a dimension are inter-
                     preted. For example, for dimension type TOPIC_FILTER, the
                     IN  operator, a message will be counted only if its topic
                     matches one of the topic filters. With NOT_IN operator, a
                     message  will  be counted only if it doesn't match any of
                     the topic filters. The operator is optional: if it's  not
                     provided (is null ), it will be interpreted as IN .

              criteria -> (structure)
                 The  criteria that determine if a device is behaving normally
                 in regard to the metric .

                 NOTE:
                     In the IoT console, you can choose to be  sent  an  alert
                     through  Amazon SNS when IoT Device Defender detects that
                     a device is behaving anomalously.

                 comparisonOperator -> (string)
                     The operator that relates the thing measured (metric ) to
                     the  criteria (containing a value or statisticalThreshold
                     ). Valid operators include:

                     o string-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o number-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o ip-address-list : in-cidr-set and not-in-cidr-set

                     o number : less-than , less-than-equals , greater-than  ,
                       and greater-than-equals

                 value -> (structure)
                     The value to be compared with the metric .

                     count -> (long)
                        If  the  comparisonOperator calls for a numeric value,
                        use this to specify that numeric value to be  compared
                        with the metric .

                     cidrs -> (list)
                        If  the  comparisonOperator  calls for a set of CIDRs,
                        use this to specify that set to be compared  with  the
                        metric .

                        (string)

                     ports -> (list)
                        If  the  comparisonOperator  calls for a set of ports,
                        use this to specify that set to be compared  with  the
                        metric .

                        (integer)

                     number -> (double)
                        The numeral value of a metric.

                     numbers -> (list)
                        The numeral values of a metric.

                        (double)

                     strings -> (list)
                        The string values of a metric.

                        (string)

                 durationSeconds -> (integer)
                     Use  this to specify the time duration over which the be-
                     havior is evaluated, for those criteria that have a  time
                     dimension  (for  example, NUM_MESSAGES_SENT ). For a sta-
                     tisticalThreshhold metric comparison,  measurements  from
                     all  devices  are accumulated over this time duration be-
                     fore being used to calculate percentiles, and later, mea-
                     surements  from an individual device are also accumulated
                     over this time duration before being given  a  percentile
                     rank. Cannot be used with list-based metric datatypes.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                     If a device is in violation of the behavior for the spec-
                     ified number of consecutive datapoints, an alarm  occurs.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToClear -> (integer)
                     If  an  alarm has occurred and the offending device is no
                     longer in violation of the  behavior  for  the  specified
                     number  of  consecutive datapoints, the alarm is cleared.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 statisticalThreshold -> (structure)
                     A  statistical  ranking  (percentile)that   indicates   a
                     threshold  value  by which a behavior is determined to be
                     in compliance or in violation of the behavior.

                     statistic -> (string)
                        The percentile that resolves to a threshold  value  by
                        which  compliance  with a behavior is determined. Met-
                        rics are collected over the  specified  period  (dura-
                        tionSeconds  )  from all reporting devices in your ac-
                        count and statistical ranks are calculated. Then,  the
                        measurements from a device are collected over the same
                        period. If the accumulated measurements from  the  de-
                        vice  fall  above  or  below (comparisonOperator ) the
                        value associated with the percentile  specified,  then
                        the  device is considered to be in compliance with the
                        behavior, otherwise a violation occurs.

                 mlDetectionConfig -> (structure)
                     The configuration of an ML Detect

                     confidenceLevel -> (string)
                        The sensitivity of anomalous behavior evaluation.  Can
                        be Low , Medium , or High .

              suppressAlerts -> (boolean)
                 Suppresses alerts.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To validate the behaviors parameters for a security profile
