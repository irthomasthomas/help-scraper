OPTIONS
       --execution-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the command execution. This information is
          returned as a response of the StartCommandExecution API request.

       --target-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the device on which the command
          execution is being performed.

       --include-result | --no-include-result (boolean)
          Can be used to specify whether to include the result of the  command
          execution  in  the GetCommandExecution API response. Your device can
          use this field to provide additional information about  the  command
          execution.  You  only  need  to  specify  this  field when using the
          AWS-IoT namespace.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       executionId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the command execution.

       commandArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource  Number  (ARN)  of  the  command.  For  example,
          arn:aws:iot:<region>:<accountid>:command/<commandId>

       targetArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the device on which the command
          execution is being performed.

       status -> (string)
          The status of the command execution. After your devices receive  the
          command  and  start  performing the operations specified in the com-
          mand, it can use the UpdateCommandExecution MQTT API to  update  the
          status information.

       statusReason -> (structure)
          Your  devices  can  use this parameter to provide additional context
          about the status of a command execution using a reason code and  de-
          scription.

          reasonCode -> (string)
              A  code  that provides additional context for the command execu-
              tion status.

          reasonDescription -> (string)
              A literal string for devices to  optionally  provide  additional
              information  about  the reason code for a command execution sta-
              tus.

       result -> (map)
          The result value for the current state of the command execution. The
          status provides information about the progress of the command execu-
          tion. The device can use the result field to  share  additional  de-
          tails  about  the execution such as a return value of a remote func-
          tion call.

          NOTE:
              If you use the AWS-IoT-FleetWise namespace, then this  field  is
              not applicable in the API response.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              The  result  value  of the command execution. The device can use
              the result field to share additional details about the execution
              such as a return value of a remote function call.

              NOTE:
                 This field is not applicable if you use the AWS-IoT-FleetWise
                 namespace.

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:
                     "S": "Hello"

                 An attribute of type Binary.

       parameters -> (map)
          The list of parameters that the StartCommandExecution API used  when
          performing the command on the device.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              The  range of possible values that's used to describe a specific
              command parameter.

              NOTE:

                 fields listed.

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:
                     "S": "Hello"

                     "BOOL": true

              I -> (integer)
                 An attribute of type Integer (Thirty-Two Bits).

       executionTimeoutSeconds -> (long)
          Specifies  the amount of time in seconds that the device can take to
          finish a command execution. A timer starts when the  command  execu-
          tion  is  created. If the command execution status is not set to an-
          other terminal state before the timer expires, it will automatically
          update to TIMED_OUT .
