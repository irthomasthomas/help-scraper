LIST-COMMAND-EXECUTIONS()                            LIST-COMMAND-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-command-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       List all command executions.

       WARNING:
          You  must  provide  only the startedTimeFilter or the completedTime-
          Filter information. If you provide both time filters, the  API  will
          generate an error. You can use this information to find command exe-
          cutions that started within a specific timeframe.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-command-executions is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: commandExecutions

OPTIONS
       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the command.

          Possible values:

          o AWS-IoT

          o AWS-IoT-FleetWise

       --status (string)
          List  all  command  executions for the device that have a particular
          status. For example, you can filter the list to display only command
          executions that have failed or timed out.

          Possible values:

          o CREATED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o SUCCEEDED

          o FAILED

          o REJECTED

          o TIMED_OUT

       --sort-order (string)
          Specify  whether to list the command executions that were created in
          the ascending or descending order. By default, the API  returns  all
          commands  in the descending order based on the start time or comple-
          tion time of the executions, that are determined by  the  startTime-
          Filter and completeTimeFilter parameters.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --started-time-filter (structure)
          List  all  command  executions that started any time before or after
          the date and time that you specify. The date and time uses the  for-
          mat yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm .

          after -> (string)
              Filter  to  display command executions that started or completed
              only after a particular date and time.

          before -> (string)
              Filter to display command executions that started  or  completed
              only before a particular date and time.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          after=string,before=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "after": "string",
            "before": "string"
          }

       --completed-time-filter (structure)
          List  all command executions that completed any time before or after
          the date and time that you specify. The date and time uses the  for-
          mat yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm .

          after -> (string)
              Filter  to  display command executions that started or completed
              only after a particular date and time.

          before -> (string)
              Filter to display command executions that started  or  completed
              only before a particular date and time.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          after=string,before=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "after": "string",
            "before": "string"
          }

       --target-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Number (ARN) of the target device. You can use
          this information to list all command executions for a particular de-
          vice.

       --command-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Number (ARN) of the command. You can use this
          information to list all command executions for a particular command.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
