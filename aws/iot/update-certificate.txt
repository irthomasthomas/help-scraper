UPDATE-CERTIFICATE()                                      UPDATE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       update-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  status  of  the  specified certificate. This operation is
       idempotent.

       Requires permission to access the UpdateCertificate action.

       Certificates must be in the ACTIVE state to authenticate  devices  that
       use a certificate to connect to IoT.

       Within a few minutes of updating a certificate from the ACTIVE state to
       any other state, IoT disconnects all devices that used that certificate
       to  connect. Devices cannot use a certificate that is not in the ACTIVE
       state to reconnect.

OPTIONS
       --certificate-id (string)
          The ID of the certificate. (The last part  of  the  certificate  ARN
          contains the certificate ID.)

       --new-status (string)
          The new status.
              Note:  Setting the status to PENDING_TRANSFER or PENDING_ACTIVA-
              TION will result in an exception being thrown.  PENDING_TRANSFER
              and PENDING_ACTIVATION are statuses used internally by IoT. They
              are not intended for developer use.

              Note: The  status  value  REGISTER_INACTIVE  is  deprecated  and
              should not be used.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

          o REVOKED

          o PENDING_TRANSFER

          o REGISTER_INACTIVE

          o PENDING_ACTIVATION

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a device certificate

       The following update-certificate example sets the specified device cer-
       tificate to INACTIVE status.

          aws iot update-certificate \
              --certificate-id d1eb269fb55a628552143c8f96eb3c258fcd5331ea113e766ba0c82bf225f0be \
              --new-status INACTIVE

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see UpdateCertificate in the AWS IoT  API  Refer-
       ence.

OUTPUT
       None
