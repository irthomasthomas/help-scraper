SYNOPSIS
            get-topic-rule-destination
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The ARN of the topic rule destination.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a topic rule destination

       The following get-topic-rule-destination example gets information about
       a topic rule destination.

          aws iot get-topic-rule-destination \
              --arn "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:ruledestination/http/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE"

       Output:

          {
              "topicRuleDestination": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:ruledestination/http/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
                  "status": "DISABLED",
                  "httpUrlProperties": {
                      "confirmationUrl": "https://example.com"
                  }
              }
          }

       AWS IoT Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       topicRuleDestination -> (structure)
          The topic rule destination.

          arn -> (string)
              The topic rule destination URL.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the topic rule destination. Valid values are:
                 IN_PROGRESS

              A topic rule destination was created but has not been confirmed.
              You can set status to IN_PROGRESS by calling UpdateTopicRuleDes-
              tination  . Calling UpdateTopicRuleDestination causes a new con-
              firmation challenge to be sent to your confirmation endpoint.
                 ENABLED

              Confirmation was completed, and traffic to this  destination  is
              allowed.  You  can set status to DISABLED by calling UpdateTopi-
              cRuleDestination .
                 DISABLED

              Confirmation was completed, and traffic to this  destination  is
              not  allowed.  You  can set status to ENABLED by calling Update-
              TopicRuleDestination .
                 ERROR

              Confirmation could not be completed, for example if the  confir-
              mation  timed  out. You can call GetTopicRuleDestination for de-
              tails about the error. You can  set  status  to  IN_PROGRESS  by
              calling UpdateTopicRuleDestination . Calling UpdateTopicRuleDes-
              tination causes a new confirmation challenge to be sent to  your
              confirmation endpoint.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the topic rule destination was created.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and time when the topic rule destination was last up-
              dated.

          statusReason -> (string)
              Additional details or reason why the topic rule  destination  is
              in the current status.

          httpUrlProperties -> (structure)
              Properties of the HTTP URL.

              confirmationUrl -> (string)
                 The URL used to confirm the HTTP topic rule destination URL.

          vpcProperties -> (structure)
              Properties of the virtual private cloud (VPC) connection.

                 (string)

              vpcId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC.

              roleArn -> (string)
