OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the job to be canceled.

       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing whose execution of the job will be canceled.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          (Optional) If true the job execution will be canceled if it has sta-
          tus IN_PROGRESS or QUEUED, otherwise the job execution will be  can-
          celed  only  if it has status QUEUED. If you attempt to cancel a job
          execution that is IN_PROGRESS, and you do not set force  to  true  ,
          then  an InvalidStateTransitionException will be thrown. The default
          is false .

          Canceling a job execution which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause the de-
          vice  to  be  unable to update the job execution status. Use caution
          and ensure that the device is able to recover to a valid state.

       --expected-version (long)
          (Optional) The expected current version of the job  execution.  Each
          time  you  update  the job execution, its version is incremented. If
          the version of the job execution stored in Jobs does not match,  the
          update  is  rejected  with  a VersionMismatch error, and an ErrorRe-
          sponse that contains the current job execution status  data  is  re-
          turned.  (This  makes  it  unnecessary  to  perform  a  separate De-
          scribeJobExecution request in order to obtain the job execution sta-
          tus data.)

       --status-details (map)
          A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the job
          execution. If not specified, the statusDetails  are  unchanged.  You
          can specify at most 10 name/value pairs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To cancel a job execution on a device

       The following cancel-job-execution example cancels the execution of the
       specified  job on a device.  If the job is not in the QUEUED state, you
       must add the --force parameter.

          aws iot cancel-job-execution \
              --job-id "example-job-03" \
              --thing-name "MyRPi"

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Creating and Managing Jobs (CLI) in  the  AWS
       IoT Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
