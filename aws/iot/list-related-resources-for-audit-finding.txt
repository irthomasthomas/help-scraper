LIST-RELATED-RESOURCES-FOR-AUDIT-FINLIST-RELATED-RESOURCES-FOR-AUDIT-FINDING()



NAME
       list-related-resources-for-audit-finding -

DESCRIPTION
       The  related resources of an Audit finding. The following resources can
       be returned from calling this API:

       o DEVICE_CERTIFICATE

       o CA_CERTIFICATE

       o IOT_POLICY

       o COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL

       o CLIENT_ID

       o ACCOUNT_SETTINGS

       o ROLE_ALIAS

       o IAM_ROLE

       o ISSUER_CERTIFICATE

       NOTE:
          This API is similar to DescribeAuditFinding's  RelatedResources  but
          provides pagination and is not limited to 10 resources. When calling
          DescribeAuditFinding for the intermediate CA revoked for active  de-
          vice certificates check, RelatedResources will not be populated. You
          must use this API, ListRelatedResourcesForAuditFinding, to list  the
          certificates.

OPTIONS
       --finding-id (string)
          The finding Id.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token  that  can  be used to retrieve the next set of results, or
          null if there are no additional results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return at one time.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
