DISASSOCIATE-FACES()                                      DISASSOCIATE-FACES()



NAME
       disassociate-faces -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the association between a Face supplied in an array of FaceIds
       and the User. If the User is not present already, then  a  ResourceNot-
       Found  exception  is  thrown. If successful, an array of faces that are
       disassociated from the User is returned. If a  given  face  is  already
       disassociated  from the given UserID, it will be ignored and not be re-
       turned in the response. If a given face is already  associated  with  a
       different  User  or  not found in the collection it will be returned as
       part of UnsuccessfulDisassociations . You can remove 1 - 100  face  IDs
       from a user at one time.

OPTIONS
       --collection-id (string)
          The ID of an existing collection containing the UserID.

       --user-id (string)
          ID for the existing UserID.

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent token used to identify the request to DisassociateFaces .
          If you use the same token with multiple DisassociateFaces  requests,
          the same response is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the
          same request from being processed more than once.

       --face-ids (list)
          An array of face IDs to disassociate from the UserID.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DisassociatedFaces -> (list)
          An array of DissociatedFace objects containing FaceIds that are suc-
          cessfully disassociated with the UserID is returned. Returned if the
          DisassociatedFaces action is successful.

          (structure)
              Provides face metadata for the faces that are disassociated from
              a specific UserID.

              FaceId -> (string)
                 Unique identifier assigned to the face.

       UnsuccessfulFaceDisassociations -> (list)
          An  array  of  UnsuccessfulDisassociation objects containing FaceIds
          that are not successfully associated, along with the reasons for the
          failure  to  associate.  Returned if the DisassociateFaces action is
          successful.

          (structure)
              Contains metadata like FaceId, UserID, and Reasons, for  a  face
              that was unsuccessfully disassociated.

              FaceId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier assigned to the face.

              UserId -> (string)
                 A provided ID for the UserID. Unique within the collection.

              Reasons -> (list)
                 The reason why the deletion was unsuccessful.
