       identifier (JobId ) which you use to get the results of  the  analysis.
       When  celebrity  recognition  analysis  is finished, Amazon Rekognition
       Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon  Simple  Notification
       Service  topic that you specify in NotificationChannel . To get the re-
       sults of the celebrity recognition analysis, first check that the  sta-
       tus  value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED . If so, call
       GetCelebrityRecognition and pass the job identifier (JobId )  from  the
       initial call to StartCelebrityRecognition .

SYNOPSIS
            start-celebrity-recognition
          --video <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The video in which you want to recognize celebrities. The video must
          be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If  the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use  the
          same  token  with  multiple  StartCelebrityRecognition requests, the
          same JobId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent  the  same
          job from being accidently started more than once.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The  Amazon  SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon Rekognition Video to
          publish the completion status of the celebrity recognition  analysis
          to.  The  Amazon  SNS  topic must have a topic name that begins with
          AmazonRekognition if you are using the  AmazonRekognitionServiceRole
          permissions policy.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon Rekognition posts the com-
              pletion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition  publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An  identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notifi-
          cation that's published to your Amazon Simple  Notification  Service
          topic.  For  example,  you  can use JobTag to group related jobs and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
