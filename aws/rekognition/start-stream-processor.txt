START-STREAM-PROCESSOR()                              START-STREAM-PROCESSOR()



NAME
       start-stream-processor -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  processing a stream processor. You create a stream processor by
       calling  CreateStreamProcessor .  To  tell  StartStreamProcessor  which
       stream processor to start, use the value of the Name field specified in
       the call to CreateStreamProcessor .

       If you are using a label detection stream processor to  detect  labels,
       you  need  to provide a Start selector and a Stop selector to determine
       the length of the stream processing time.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-stream-processor
          --name <value>
          [--start-selector <value>]
          [--stop-selector <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the stream processor to start processing.

       --start-selector (structure)
          Specifies the starting point in the Kinesis stream to start process-
          ing.  You can use the producer timestamp or the fragment number. For
          more information, see Fragment .

          This is a required parameter for label detection  stream  processors
          and should not be used to start a face search stream processor.

          KVSStreamStartSelector -> (structure)
              Specifies  the starting point in the stream to start processing.
              This can be done with a timestamp or a fragment number in a  Ki-
              nesis stream.

              ProducerTimestamp -> (long)
                 The  timestamp  from  the producer corresponding to the frag-
                 ment.

              FragmentNumber -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the fragment. This  value  monotoni-
                 cally increases based on the ingestion order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KVSStreamStartSelector={ProducerTimestamp=long,FragmentNumber=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KVSStreamStartSelector": {
              "ProducerTimestamp": long,
              "FragmentNumber": "string"
            }
          }

       --stop-selector (structure)
          Specifies when to stop processing the stream. You can specify a max-
          imum amount of time to process the video.

          This is a required parameter for label detection  stream  processors
          and should not be used to start a face search stream processor.

          MaxDurationInSeconds -> (long)
              Specifies  the  maximum  amount of time in seconds that you want
              the stream to be processed. The largest amount of time is 2 min-
              utes. The default is 10 seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MaxDurationInSeconds=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MaxDurationInSeconds": long
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start a stream processor

       The following start-stream-processor command starts the specified video
       stream processor.

          aws rekognition start-stream-processor \
              --name my-stream-processor

       This command produces no output.

       For  more  information, see Working with Streaming Videos in the Amazon
       Rekognition Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       SessionId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the stream processing session.
