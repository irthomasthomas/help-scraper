START-STREAM-PROCESSOR()                              START-STREAM-PROCESSOR()



NAME
       start-stream-processor -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  processing a stream processor. You create a stream processor by
       calling  CreateStreamProcessor .  To  tell  StartStreamProcessor  which
       stream processor to start, use the value of the Name field specified in
       the call to CreateStreamProcessor .

       If you are using a label detection stream processor to  detect  labels,
       you  need  to provide a Start selector and a Stop selector to determine
       the length of the stream processing time.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the stream processor to start processing.

       --start-selector (structure)
          Specifies the starting point in the Kinesis stream to start process-
          ing.  You can use the producer timestamp or the fragment number. For
          more information, see Fragment .

          This is a required parameter for label detection  stream  processors
          and should not be used to start a face search stream processor.

          KVSStreamStartSelector -> (structure)
              Specifies  the starting point in the stream to start processing.
              This can be done with a timestamp or a fragment number in a  Ki-
              nesis stream.

              ProducerTimestamp -> (long)
                 The  timestamp  from  the producer corresponding to the frag-
                 ment.

              FragmentNumber -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the fragment. This  value  monotoni-
                 cally increases based on the ingestion order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KVSStreamStartSelector={ProducerTimestamp=long,FragmentNumber=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KVSStreamStartSelector": {
              "ProducerTimestamp": long,
              "FragmentNumber": "string"
            }
          }

       --stop-selector (structure)
          Specifies when to stop processing the stream. You can specify a max-
          imum amount of time to process the video.

          This is a required parameter for label detection  stream  processors
          and should not be used to start a face search stream processor.

          MaxDurationInSeconds -> (long)
              Specifies  the  maximum  amount of time in seconds that you want
              the stream to be processed. The largest amount of time is 2 min-
              utes. The default is 10 seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MaxDurationInSeconds=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MaxDurationInSeconds": long
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start a stream processor

       The following start-stream-processor command starts the specified video
       stream processor.

          aws rekognition start-stream-processor \
              --name my-stream-processor

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Working with Streaming Videos in  the  Amazon
       Rekognition Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       SessionId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the stream processing session.
