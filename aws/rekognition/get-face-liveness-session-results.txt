NAME
       get-face-liveness-session-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the results of a specific Face Liveness session. It requires
       the sessionId as input, which was created using  CreateFaceLivenessSes-
       sion . Returns the corresponding Face Liveness confidence score, a ref-
       erence image that includes a face bounding box, and audit  images  that
       also  contain  face  bounding boxes. The Face Liveness confidence score
       ranges from 0 to 100.

       The number of audit images returned by GetFaceLivenessSessionResults is
       defined  by the AuditImagesLimit paramater when calling CreateFaceLive-
       nessSession . Reference images are always returned when possible.

OPTIONS
       --session-id (string)
          A unique 128-bit UUID. This is used to uniquely identify the session
          and  also acts as an idempotency token for all operations associated
          with the session.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SessionId -> (string)
          The sessionId for which this request was called.

       Status -> (string)
          Represents  a status corresponding to the state of the session. Pos-
          sible statuses are: CREATED,  IN_PROGRESS,  SUCCEEDED,  FAILED,  EX-
          PIRED.

       Confidence -> (float)
          Probabalistic  confidence score for if the person in the given video
          was live, represented as a float value between 0 to 100.

       ReferenceImage -> (structure)
          A high-quality image from the Face Liveness video that can  be  used
          for  face  comparison  or  search. It includes a bounding box of the
          face and the Base64-encoded bytes that return an image. If the  Cre-
          ateFaceLivenessSession  request  included  an OutputConfig argument,
          the image will be uploaded to an S3Object specified  in  the  output
          configuration.  In  case  the  reference image is not returned, it's
          recommended to retry the Liveness check.

          Bytes -> (blob)
              The Base64-encoded bytes representing an image selected from the
              Face Liveness video and returned for audit purposes.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              Provides the S3 bucket name and object name.

              The region for the S3 bucket containing the S3 object must match
              the region you use for Amazon Rekognition operations.

              For Amazon Rekognition to process an S3 object,  the  user  must
              have  permission  to access the S3 object. For more information,
              see How Amazon Rekognition works with IAM in the Amazon Rekogni-
              tion Developer Guide.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If  the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

          BoundingBox -> (structure)
              Identifies the bounding box around the label, face, text, object
              of interest, or personal protective equipment. The left (x-coor-
              dinate) and top (y-coordinate) are coordinates representing  the
              top and left sides of the bounding box. Note that the upper-left
              corner of the image is the origin (0,0).

              The top and left values returned are ratios of the overall image
              size. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the
              top-left coordinate of the bounding box is  350x50  pixels,  the
              API  returns  a  left  value of 0.5 (350/700) and a top value of
              0.25 (50/200).

              The width and height values  represent  the  dimensions  of  the
              bounding  box as a ratio of the overall image dimension. For ex-
              ample, if the input image is 700x200 pixels,  and  the  bounding
              box width is 70 pixels, the width returned is 0.1.

              NOTE:
                 The  bounding  box  coordinates can have negative values. For
                 example, if Amazon Rekognition is able to detect a face  that
                 is  at the image edge and is only partially visible, the ser-
                 vice can return coordinates that are outside the image bounds
                 and, depending on the image edge, you might get negative val-
                 ues or values greater than 1 for the left or top values.

              Width -> (float)
                 Width of the bounding box as a ratio  of  the  overall  image
                 width.

              Height -> (float)
                 Height  of  the  bounding box as a ratio of the overall image
                 height.

              Left -> (float)
                 Left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall im-
                 age width.

              Top -> (float)
                 Top  coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall im-
                 age height.

       AuditImages -> (list)
          A set of images from the Face Liveness video that can  be  used  for
          audit  purposes.  It  includes  a  bounding  box of the face and the
          Base64-encoded bytes that return an image.  If  the  CreateFaceLive-
          nessSession  request  included  an  OutputConfig argument, the image
          will be uploaded to an S3Object specified in the  output  configura-
          tion. If no Amazon S3 bucket is defined, raw bytes are sent instead.

          (structure)
              An  image  that  is  picked from the Face Liveness video and re-
              turned for audit  trail  purposes,  returned  as  Base64-encoded
              bytes.

              Bytes -> (blob)
                 The  Base64-encoded bytes representing an image selected from
                 the Face Liveness video and returned for audit purposes.

              S3Object -> (structure)
                 Provides the S3 bucket name and object name.

                 The region for the S3 bucket containing the  S3  object  must
                 match the region you use for Amazon Rekognition operations.

                 For Amazon Rekognition to process an S3 object, the user must
                 have permission to access the S3 object.  For  more  informa-
                 tion, see How Amazon Rekognition works with IAM in the Amazon
                 Rekognition Developer Guide.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     Name of the S3 bucket.

                 Name -> (string)
                     S3 object key name.

                 Version -> (string)
                     If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify  the
                     object version.

              BoundingBox -> (structure)
                 Identifies the bounding box around the label, face, text, ob-
                 ject of interest, or personal protective equipment. The  left
                 (x-coordinate)  and top (y-coordinate) are coordinates repre-
                 senting the top and left sides of the bounding box. Note that
                 the upper-left corner of the image is the origin (0,0).

                 The  top  and  left values returned are ratios of the overall
                 image size. For example, if the input image is  700x200  pix-
                 els,  and  the  top-left  coordinate  of  the bounding box is
                 350x50 pixels, the API returns a left value of 0.5  (350/700)
                 and a top value of 0.25 (50/200).

                 The  width  and height values represent the dimensions of the
                 bounding box as a ratio of the overall image  dimension.  For
                 example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the bound-
                 ing box width is 70 pixels, the width returned is 0.1.

                 NOTE:
                     The bounding box coordinates can  have  negative  values.
                     For  example,  if  Amazon Rekognition is able to detect a
                     face that is at the image edge and is only partially vis-
                     ible, the service can return coordinates that are outside
                     the image bounds and, depending on the  image  edge,  you
                     might  get  negative  values or values greater than 1 for
                     the left or top values.

                 Width -> (float)
                     Width of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image
                     width.

                 Height -> (float)
                     Height  of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall im-
                     age height.

                 Left -> (float)
                     Left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall
                     image width.

                 Top -> (float)
                     Top  coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall
                     image height.
