DESCRIBE-PROJECT-VERSIONS()                        DESCRIBE-PROJECT-VERSIONS()



NAME
       describe-project-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  and  describes  the versions of a model in an Amazon Rekognition
       Custom Labels project. You can specify up to 10 model versions in  Pro-
       jectVersionArns  .  If  you don't specify a value, descriptions for all
       model versions in the project are returned.

       This operation requires  permissions  to  perform  the  rekognition:De-
       scribeProjectVersions action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-project-versions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ProjectVersionDescriptions

OPTIONS
       --project-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project that contains the mod-
          els you want to describe.

       --version-names (list)
          A list of model version names that you want to describe. You can add
          up to 10 model version names to the list. If  you  don't  specify  a
          value,  all  model descriptions are returned. A version name is part
          of    a     model     (ProjectVersion)     ARN.     For     example,
          my-model.2020-01-21T09.10.15  is  the  version name in the following
          ARN.         arn:aws:rekognition:us-east-1:123456789012:project/get-
          ting-started/version/*my-model.2020-01-21T09.10.15* /1234567890123 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                        test dataset (20%) for the training job. After  train-
                        ing  completes, the test dataset is not stored and the

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The identifer for the AWS Key Management Service key (AWS KMS
                 key) that was used to encrypt the model during training.

              MaxInferenceUnits -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of inference units Amazon Rekognition Cus-
                 tom Labels uses to auto-scale the model.  For  more  informa-

              SourceProjectVersionArn -> (string)
                 If  the  model  version  was copied from a different project,
                 SourceProjectVersionArn contains the ARN of the source  model
                 version.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  previous response was incomplete (because there is more re-
          sults to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels returns a pagi-
