GET-SEGMENT-DETECTION()                                GET-SEGMENT-DETECTION()



NAME
       get-segment-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the segment detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analy-
       sis started by  StartSegmentDetection .

       Segment detection with Amazon Rekognition Video is an asynchronous  op-
       eration.  You start segment detection by calling  StartSegmentDetection
       which returns a job identifier (JobId ). When the segment detection op-
       eration  finishes,  Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to
       the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the  initial
       call  to  StartSegmentDetection . To get the results of the segment de-
       tection operation, first check that the status value published  to  the
       Amazon  SNS  topic  is  SUCCEEDED . if so, call GetSegmentDetection and
       pass the job identifier (JobId ) from the initial call of StartSegment-
       Detection .
          GetSegmentDetection  returns detected segments in an array (Segments
          ) of  SegmentDetection objects. Segments is sorted  by  the  segment
          types specified in the SegmentTypes input parameter of StartSegment-
          Detection . Each element of the array includes the detected segment,
          the  precentage  confidence  in the acuracy of the detected segment,
          the type of the segment, and the frame in which the segment was  de-
          tected.

       Use  SelectedSegmentTypes to find out the type of segment detection re-
       quested in the call to StartSegmentDetection .

       Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of segment  detections
       returned.  If there are more results than specified in MaxResults , the
       value of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination  to-
       ken  for  getting  the next set of results. To get the next page of re-
       sults, call GetSegmentDetection and populate the NextToken request  pa-
       rameter with the token value returned from the previous call to GetSeg-
       mentDetection .

       the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          Job  identifier  for the text detection operation for which you want
          results returned. You get the job identifer from an initial call  to
          StartSegmentDetection .

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum  number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
          value you can specify is 1000.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Rekognition Video returns  this
          token  that  you  can  use in the subsequent request to retrieve the
          next set of text.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
