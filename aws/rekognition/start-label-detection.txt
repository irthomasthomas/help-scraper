START-LABEL-DETECTION()                                START-LABEL-DETECTION()



NAME
       start-label-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video.

       Amazon  Rekognition  Video can detect labels in a video. Labels are in-
       stances of real-world entities.  This  includes  objects  like  flower,
       tree,  and  table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party;
       concepts like landscape, evening, and nature;  and  activities  like  a
       person getting out of a car or a person skiing.

       The  video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify
       the bucket name and the filename of the video. StartLabelDetection  re-
       turns a job identifier (JobId ) which you use to get the results of the
       operation. When label detection is finished, Amazon  Rekognition  Video
       publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service
       topic that you specify in NotificationChannel .

       To get the results of the label detection operation, first  check  that
       the  status  value  published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED . If
       so, call  GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId  )  from
       the initial call to StartLabelDetection .
          Optional Parameters

          StartLabelDetection  has  the  GENERAL_LABELS Feature applied by de-
          fault. This feature allows you to provide filtering criteria to  the
          Settings parameter. You can filter with sets of individual labels or
          with label categories. You can specify inclusive filters,  exclusive
          filters,  or  a  combination of inclusive and exclusive filters. For
          more information on filtering, see Detecting labels in a video .

       You can specify MinConfidence to control the confidence  threshold  for
       the labels returned. The default is 50.

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The  video  in  which  you  want to detect labels. The video must be
          stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the  ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent  token used to identify the start request. If you use the
          same token with multiple StartLabelDetection requests, the same  Jo-
          bId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from
          being accidently started more than once.

       --min-confidence (float)
          Specifies the minimum confidence that Amazon Rekognition Video  must
          have  in order to return a detected label. Confidence represents how
          certain Amazon Rekognition is that a label is correctly identified.0
          is  the  lowest  confidence.  100  is the highest confidence. Amazon
          Rekognition Video doesn't return any labels with a confidence  level
          lower than this specified value.

          If  you  don't  specify MinConfidence , the operation returns labels
          and bounding boxes (if detected) with confidence values greater than
          or equal to 50 percent.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The  Amazon  SNS topic ARN you want Amazon Rekognition Video to pub-
          lish the completion status of the label detection operation to.  The
          Amazon  SNS  topic  must  have a topic name that begins with Amazon-
          Rekognition if you are using the  AmazonRekognitionServiceRole  per-
          missions policy.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon Rekognition posts the com-
              pletion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition  publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An  identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notifi-
          cation that's published to your Amazon Simple  Notification  Service
          topic.  For  example,  you  can use JobTag to group related jobs and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --features (list)
          The features to return after video analysis. You  can  specify  that
          GENERAL_LABELS are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --settings (structure)

          ERAL_LABELS.

          GeneralLabels -> (structure)
              Contains filters for the object labels returned by DetectLabels.
              Filters  can  be  inclusive, exclusive, or a combination of both
              and can be applied to individual labels or  entire  label  cate-
              gories.  To see a list of label categories, see Detecting Labels

              LabelExclusionFilters -> (list)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-

       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
