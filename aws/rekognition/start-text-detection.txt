START-TEXT-DETECTION()                                  START-TEXT-DETECTION()



NAME
       start-text-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts asynchronous detection of text in a stored video.

       Amazon Rekognition Video can detect text in a video stored in an Amazon
       S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify the bucket name and  the  filename  of
       the  video.  StartTextDetection returns a job identifier (JobId ) which
       you use to get the results of the operation.  When  text  detection  is
       finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the
       Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in  Notifica-
       tionChannel .

       To  get  the  results of the text detection operation, first check that
       the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is  SUCCEEDED  .  if
       so,  call   GetTextDetection  and pass the job identifier (JobId ) from
       the initial call to StartTextDetection .

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          Video file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Amazon  Rekognition  video
          start operations such as  StartLabelDetection use Video to specify a
          video for analysis. The supported file formats are  .mp4,  .mov  and
          .avi.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If  the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use  the
          same token with multiple StartTextDetection requests, the same JobId
          is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from be-
          ing accidentaly started more than once.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The  Amazon Simple Notification Service topic to which Amazon Rekog-
          nition publishes the completion status of a  video  analysis  opera-
          tion. For more information, see Calling Amazon Rekognition Video op-
          erations . Note that the Amazon SNS topic must  have  a  topic  name
          that begins with AmazonRekognition if you are using the AmazonRekog-
          nitionServiceRole permissions policy to access the topic.  For  more
          information, see Giving access to multiple Amazon SNS topics .

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon Rekognition posts the com-
              pletion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition  publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An  identifier  returned  in the completion status published by your
          Amazon Simple Notification Service topic. For example, you  can  use
          JobTag to group related jobs and identify them in the completion no-
          tification.

       --filters (structure)
          Optional parameters that let you set criteria the text must meet  to
          be included in your response.

          WordFilter -> (structure)
              Filters focusing on qualities of the text, such as confidence or
              size.

              MinConfidence -> (float)
                 Sets the confidence of word detection. Words  with  detection
                 confidence  below this will be excluded from the result. Val-
                 ues should be between 0 and 100. The default MinConfidence is
                 80.

              MinBoundingBoxHeight -> (float)
                 Sets  the minimum height of the word bounding box. Words with
                 bounding box heights lesser than this value will be  excluded
                 from the result. Value is relative to the video frame height.

              MinBoundingBoxWidth -> (float)
                 Sets  the  minimum width of the word bounding box. Words with
                 bounding boxes widths lesser than this value will be excluded
                 from the result. Value is relative to the video frame width.

          RegionsOfInterest -> (list)
              Filter focusing on a certain area of the frame. Uses a Bounding-
              Box object to set the region of the screen.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a location within the frame that Rekognition checks
                 for  objects  of  interest such as text, labels, or faces. It
                 uses a BoundingBox or Polygon to set a region of the screen.

                 A word, face, or label is included in the  region  if  it  is
                 more  than half in that region. If there is more than one re-
                 gion, the word, face, or label is compared with  all  regions
                 of  the screen. Any object of interest that is more than half
                 in a region is kept in the results.

                 BoundingBox -> (structure)
                     The box representing a region of interest on screen.

                     Width -> (float)
                        Width of the bounding box as a ratio  of  the  overall
                        image width.

                     Height -> (float)
                        Height  of  the bounding box as a ratio of the overall
                        image height.

                     Left -> (float)
                        Left coordinate of the bounding  box  as  a  ratio  of
                        overall image width.

                     Top -> (float)
                        Top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of over-
                        all image height.

                 Polygon -> (list)
                     Specifies a shape made up of up to 10  Point  objects  to
                     define a region of interest.

                     (structure)
                        The  X  and  Y  coordinates  of a point on an image or
                        video frame. The X and Y  values  are  ratios  of  the
                        overall  image  size or video resolution. For example,
                        if an input image is 700x200 and the values are  X=0.5
                        and  Y=0.25,  then  the point is at the (350,50) pixel
                        coordinate on the image.

                        An array of Point objects makes up a Polygon . A Poly-
                        gon is returned by  DetectText and by  DetectCustomLa-
                        bels  Polygon represents a fine-grained polygon around
                        a detected item. For more information, see Geometry in
                        the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

                        X -> (float)
                            The value of the X coordinate for  a  point  on  a
                            Polygon .

                        Y -> (float)
                            The  value  of  the  Y coordinate for a point on a
                            Polygon .

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "WordFilter": {
              "MinConfidence": float,
              "MinBoundingBoxHeight": float,
              "MinBoundingBoxWidth": float
            },
            "RegionsOfInterest": [

                  }
                  ...
                ]
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          Identifier for the text detection job. Use JobId to identify the job
          in a subsequent call to GetTextDetection .
