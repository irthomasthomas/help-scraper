GET-TEXT-DETECTION()                                      GET-TEXT-DETECTION()



NAME
       get-text-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the text detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis
       started by  StartTextDetection .

       Text detection with Amazon Rekognition Video is an asynchronous  opera-
       tion. You start text detection by calling  StartTextDetection which re-
       turns a job identifier (JobId ) When the text detection operation  fin-
       ishes,  Amazon  Rekognition publishes a completion status to the Amazon
       Simple Notification Service topic registered in  the  initial  call  to
       StartTextDetection  .  To  get the results of the text detection opera-
       tion, first check that the status value published  to  the  Amazon  SNS
       topic  is  SUCCEEDED  .  if  so, call GetTextDetection and pass the job
       identifier (JobId ) from the initial call of StartLabelDetection .
          GetTextDetection returns an array of detected text (TextDetections )
          sorted  by  the time the text was detected, up to 50 words per frame
          of video.

       Each element of the array includes the detected  text,  the  precentage
       confidence  in  the acuracy of the detected text, the time the text was
       detected, bounding box information for where the text was located,  and
       unique identifiers for words and their lines.

       Use  MaxResults  parameter  to  limit the number of text detections re-
       turned. If there are more results than specified in  MaxResults  ,  the
       value  of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination to-
       ken for getting the next set of results. To get the next  page  of  re-
       sults, call GetTextDetection and populate the NextToken request parame-
       ter with the token value returned from the previous call to  GetTextDe-
       tection .

SYNOPSIS
            get-text-detection
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          Job  identifier  for the text detection operation for which you want
          results returned. You get the job identifer from an initial call  to
          StartTextDetection .

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum  number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
          value you can specify is 1000.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response was incomplete (because there are more  la-
          bels to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition Video returns a pagination to-
          ken in the response. You can use this pagination token  to  retrieve
          the next set of text.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
