COPY-PROJECT-VERSION()                                  COPY-PROJECT-VERSION()



NAME
       copy-project-version -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation applies only to Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels.

       Copies  a  version  of an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model from a
       source project to a destination project.  The  source  and  destination
       projects  can  be in different AWS accounts but must be in the same AWS
       Region. You can't copy a model to another AWS service.

       To copy a model version to a different AWS account, you need to  create
       a  resource-based  policy  known  as  a project policy . You attach the
       project policy to the source project by calling  PutProjectPolicy . The
       project policy gives permission to copy the model version from a trust-
       ing AWS account to a trusted account.

       For more information creating and attaching a project policy,  see  At-
       taching  a project policy (SDK) in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels
       Developer Guide .

       If you are copying a model version to a project in  the  same  AWS  ac-
       count, you don't need to create a project policy.

       NOTE:
          Copying project versions is supported only for Custom Labels models.

          To copy a model, the destination project, source project, and source
          model version must already exist.

       Copying a model version takes a while to complete. To get  the  current
       status,  call  DescribeProjectVersions and check the value of Status in
       the  ProjectVersionDescription object. The copy operation has  finished
       when the value of Status is COPYING_COMPLETED .

       This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:CopyPro-
       jectVersion action.

OPTIONS
       --source-project-arn (string)
          The ARN of the source project in the trusting AWS account.

       --source-project-version-arn (string)
          The ARN of the model version in the source project that you want  to
          copy to a destination project.

       --destination-project-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the project in the trusted AWS account that you want to
          copy the model version to.

       --version-name (string)
          A name for the version of the model that's copied to the destination
          project.

       --output-config (structure)
          The  S3 bucket and folder location where the training output for the
          source model version is placed.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The S3 bucket where training output is placed.

          S3KeyPrefix -> (string)
              The prefix applied to the training output files.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3KeyPrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3KeyPrefix": "string"
          }

       --tags (map)
          The key-value tags to assign to the model version.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The identifier for your AWS Key  Management  Service  key  (AWS  KMS
          key). You can supply the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your KMS key,
          the ID of your KMS key, an alias for your KMS key, or an alias  ARN.
          The key is used to encrypt training results and manifest files writ-
          ten to the output Amazon S3 bucket (OutputConfig ).

          If you choose to use your own KMS key, you need the  following  per-
          missions on the KMS key.

          o kms:CreateGrant

          o kms:DescribeKey

          o kms:GenerateDataKey

          o kms:Decrypt

          If  you  don't specify a value for KmsKeyId , images copied into the
          service are encrypted using a key that AWS owns and manages.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
