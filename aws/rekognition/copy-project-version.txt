COPY-PROJECT-VERSION()                                  COPY-PROJECT-VERSION()



NAME
       copy-project-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Copies  a  version  of an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model from a
       source project to a destination project.  The  source  and  destination
       projects  can  be in different AWS accounts but must be in the same AWS
       Region. You can't copy a model to another AWS service.

       To copy a model version to a different AWS account, you need to  create
       a  resource-based  policy  known  as  a project policy . You attach the
       project policy to the source project by calling  PutProjectPolicy . The
       project policy gives permission to copy the model version from a trust-
       ing AWS account to a trusted account.

       For more information creating and attaching a project policy,  see  At-
       taching  a project policy (SDK) in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels
       Developer Guide .

       If you are copying a model version to a project in  the  same  AWS  ac-
       count, you don't need to create a project policy.

       NOTE:
          To copy a model, the destination project, source project, and source
          model version must already exist.

       Copying a model version takes a while to complete. To get  the  current
       status,  call  DescribeProjectVersions and check the value of Status in
       the  ProjectVersionDescription object. The copy operation has  finished
       when the value of Status is COPYING_COMPLETED .

          --source-project-arn <value>
          --source-project-version-arn <value>
          --destination-project-arn <value>
          --version-name <value>
          --output-config <value>
          [--tags <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-project-arn (string)
          The ARN of the source project in the trusting AWS account.

       --source-project-version-arn (string)
          The  ARN of the model version in the source project that you want to
          copy to a destination project.

       --destination-project-arn (string)
          The ARN of the project in the trusted AWS account that you  want  to
          copy the model version to.

       --version-name (string)
          A name for the version of the model that's copied to the destination
          project.

       --output-config (structure)
          The S3 bucket and folder location where the training output for  the
          source model version is placed.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The S3 bucket where training output is placed.

          S3KeyPrefix -> (string)
              The prefix applied to the training output files.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3KeyPrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3KeyPrefix": "string"
          }

       --tags (map)
          The key-value tags to assign to the model version.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  identifier  for  your  AWS  Key Management Service key (AWS KMS
          key). You can supply the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your KMS key,
          the  ID of your KMS key, an alias for your KMS key, or an alias ARN.
          The key is used to encrypt training results and manifest files writ-
          ten to the output Amazon S3 bucket (OutputConfig ).

          If  you  choose to use your own KMS key, you need the following per-
          missions on the KMS key.

          o kms:CreateGrant

          o kms:DescribeKey

          o kms:GenerateDataKey

          o kms:Decrypt

          If you don't specify a value for KmsKeyId , images copied  into  the
          service are encrypted using a key that AWS owns and manages.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProjectVersionArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the copied model version in the destination project.
