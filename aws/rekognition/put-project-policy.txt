PUT-PROJECT-POLICY()                                      PUT-PROJECT-POLICY()



NAME
       put-project-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches a project policy to a Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project
       in a trusting AWS account. A project policy specifies  that  a  trusted
       AWS  account  can copy a model version from a trusting AWS account to a
       project in the trusted AWS account. To copy a model version you use the
       CopyProjectVersion operation.

       For more information about the format of a project policy document, see
       Attaching a project policy (SDK) in the Amazon Rekognition  Custom  La-
       bels Developer Guide .

       The  response  from  PutProjectPolicy  is a revision ID for the project
       policy. You can attach multiple project policies to a project. You  can
       also  update  an existing project policy by specifying the policy revi-
       sion ID of the existing policy.

       To remove a project policy from a project, call  DeleteProjectPolicy  .
       To get a list of project policies attached to a project, call  ListPro-
       jectPolicies .

       You copy a model version by calling  CopyProjectVersion .

SYNOPSIS
            put-project-policy
          --project-arn <value>
          --policy-name <value>
          [--policy-revision-id <value>]
          --policy-document <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project that the project  pol-
          icy is attached to.

       --policy-name (string)
          A name for the policy.

       --policy-revision-id (string)
          The  revision ID for the Project Policy. Each time you modify a pol-
          icy, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels generates and  assigns  a  new
          PolicyRevisionId  and  then deletes the previous version of the pol-
          icy.

       --policy-document (string)
          A resource policy to add to the model. The policy is a  JSON  struc-
          ture  that  contains  one or more statements that define the policy.
          The policy must follow the IAM syntax. For  more  information  about
          the  contents  of a JSON policy document, see IAM JSON policy refer-
          ence .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PolicyRevisionId -> (string)
          The ID of the project policy.
