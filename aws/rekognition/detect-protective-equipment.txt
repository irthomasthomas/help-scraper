DETECT-PROTECTIVE-EQUIPMENT()                    DETECT-PROTECTIVE-EQUIPMENT()



NAME
       detect-protective-equipment -

DESCRIPTION
       Detects  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) worn by people detected in
       an image. Amazon Rekognition can detect the following types of PPE.

       o Face cover

       o Hand cover

       o Head cover

       You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as  a  refer-
       ence to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. The image must be either a PNG
       or JPG formatted file.
          DetectProtectiveEquipment detects PPE worn by up to 15  persons  de-
          tected in an image.

       For  each person detected in the image the API returns an array of body
       parts (face, head, left-hand, right-hand). For each body part, an array
       of detected items of PPE is returned, including an indicator of whether
       or not the PPE covers the body part. The API returns the confidence  it
       has  in each detection (person, PPE, body part and body part coverage).
       It also returns a bounding box ( BoundingBox ) for each detected person
       and each detected item of PPE.

       You  can  optionally  request  a summary of detected PPE items with the
       SummarizationAttributes input parameter. The summary provides the  fol-
       lowing information.

       o The  persons  detected  as  wearing  all of the types of PPE that you
         specify.

       o The persons detected as not wearing all of the  types  PPE  that  you
         specify.

       o The persons detected where PPE adornment could not be determined.

       This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not per-
       sist any data.

       This operation requires permissions to perform the  rekognition:Detect-
       ProtectiveEquipment action.

OPTIONS
       --image (structure)
          The  image  in which you want to detect PPE on detected persons. The
          image can be passed as image bytes or you  can  reference  an  image
          stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          To specify a local file use --image-bytes instead.

          Bytes -> (blob)
              Blob  of  image  bytes  up to 5 MBs. Note that the maximum image
              size you can pass to DetectCustomLabels is 4MB.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              Identifies an S3 object as the image source.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the  ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bytes": blob,
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --summarization-attributes (structure)
          An array of PPE types that you want to summarize.

          MinConfidence -> (float)
              The minimum confidence level for which you want summary informa-
              tion. The confidence level applies  to  person  detection,  body
              part  detection,  equipment  detection,  and body part coverage.
              Amazon Rekognition doesn't return  summary  information  with  a
              confidence  than  this  specified  value.  There isn't a default
              value.

              Specify a MinConfidence value that is between 50-100% as Detect-
              ProtectiveEquipment returns predictions only where the detection
              confidence is between 50% - 100%. If you specify a value that is
              less  than  50%,  the results are the same specifying a value of
              50%.

          RequiredEquipmentTypes -> (list)
              An array of personal protective equipment types  for  which  you
              want  summary information. If a person is detected wearing a re-
              quired requipment type, the person's ID is added to the  Person-
              sWithRequiredEquipment array field returned in  ProtectiveEquip-
              mentSummary by DetectProtectiveEquipment .

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MinConfidence=float,RequiredEquipmentTypes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MinConfidence": float,
            "RequiredEquipmentTypes": ["FACE_COVER"|"HAND_COVER"|"HEAD_COVER", ...]
          }

       --image-bytes (blob)
          The content of the image to be uploaded. To specify the content of a
          local file use the fileb:// prefix. Example: fileb://image.png

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
