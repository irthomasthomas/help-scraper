GET-CELEBRITY-RECOGNITION()                        GET-CELEBRITY-RECOGNITION()



NAME
       get-celebrity-recognition -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  celebrity recognition results for a Amazon Rekognition Video
       analysis started by  StartCelebrityRecognition .

       Celebrity recognition in a video is an asynchronous operation. Analysis
       is  started by a call to  StartCelebrityRecognition which returns a job
       identifier (JobId ).

       When the celebrity recognition operation finishes,  Amazon  Rekognition
       Video  publishes  a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification
       Service topic registered in the initial call to  StartCelebrityRecogni-
       tion  . To get the results of the celebrity recognition analysis, first
       check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic  is  SUC-
       CEEDED  . If so, call GetCelebrityDetection and pass the job identifier
       (JobId ) from the initial call to StartCelebrityDetection .

       For more information, see Working With  Stored  Videos  in  the  Amazon
       Rekognition Developer Guide.
          GetCelebrityRecognition returns detected celebrities and the time(s)
          they are detected in an array (Celebrities )  of   CelebrityRecogni-
          tion  objects.  Each CelebrityRecognition contains information about
          the celebrity in a  CelebrityDetail object and the time, Timestamp ,
          the  celebrity was detected. This  CelebrityDetail object stores in-
          formation about the detected celebrity's  face  attributes,  a  face
          bounding  box,  known gender, the celebrity's name, and a confidence
          estimate.

       NOTE:
          GetCelebrityRecognition only returns the default  facial  attributes
          (BoundingBox  ,  Confidence  , Landmarks , Pose , and Quality ). The
          BoundingBox field only applies to the detected  face  instance.  The
          other  facial  attributes listed in the Face object of the following
          response syntax are not returned. For more information, see  FaceDe-
          tail in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

       By  default, the Celebrities array is sorted by time (milliseconds from
       the start of the video). You can also sort the array  by  celebrity  by
       specifying the value ID in the SortBy input parameter.

       The  CelebrityDetail  object includes the celebrity identifer and addi-
       tional information urls. If you don't store the additional  information
       urls,  you  can  get  them  later by calling  GetCelebrityInfo with the
       celebrity identifer.

       No information is returned for faces not recognized as celebrities.

       Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number  of  labels  returned.  If
       there  are  more  results  than  specified in MaxResults , the value of
       NextToken in the operation response contains  a  pagination  token  for
       getting  the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call
       GetCelebrityDetection and populate the NextToken request parameter with
       the token value returned from the previous call to GetCelebrityRecogni-
       tion .

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          Job identifier for the required celebrity recognition analysis.  You
          can get the job identifer from a call to StartCelebrityRecognition .

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum  number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
          value you can specify is 1000. If you specify a value  greater  than
          1000,  a  maximum  of 1000 results is returned. The default value is
          1000.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more  rec-
          ognized celebrities to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition Video returns a
          pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination  token
          to retrieve the next set of celebrities.

       --sort-by (string)
          Sort  to  use for celebrities returned in Celebrities field. Specify
          ID to sort by the celebrity identifier, specify TIMESTAMP to sort by
          the time the celebrity was recognized.

          Possible values:

          o ID

          o TIMESTAMP

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
