OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Name of the stream processor that you want to update.

       --settings-for-update (structure)
          The stream processor settings that you want to update. Label  detec-
          tion  settings can be updated to detect different labels with a dif-
          ferent minimum confidence.

          ConnectedHomeForUpdate -> (structure)
              The label detection settings you want to  use  for  your  stream
              processor.

              Labels -> (list)
                 Specifies  what you want to detect in the video, such as peo-
                 ple, packages, or pets. The current valid labels you can  in-
                 clude  in  this  list  are:  "PERSON",  "PET", "PACKAGE", and
                 "ALL".

                 (string)

              MinConfidence -> (float)
                 The minimum confidence required to label  an  object  in  the
                 video.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConnectedHomeForUpdate={Labels=[string,string],MinConfidence=float}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConnectedHomeForUpdate": {
              "Labels": ["string", ...],
              "MinConfidence": float
            }
          }

       --regions-of-interest-for-update (list)
          Specifies  locations  in  the frames where Amazon Rekognition checks
          for objects or people. This is an optional parameter for  label  de-
          tection stream processors.

          (structure)
              Specifies  a  location  within the frame that Rekognition checks
              for objects of interest such as text, labels, or faces. It  uses
              a BoundingBox or Polygon to set a region of the screen.

              A  word,  face, or label is included in the region if it is more
              than half in that region. If there is more than one region,  the
              word, face, or label is compared with all regions of the screen.
              Any object of interest that is more than half  in  a  region  is
              kept in the results.

              BoundingBox -> (structure)
                 The box representing a region of interest on screen.

                 Width -> (float)
                     Width of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image
                     width.

                 Height -> (float)
                     Height of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall  im-
                     age height.

                 Left -> (float)
                     Left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall
                     image width.

                 Top -> (float)
                     Top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of  overall
                     image height.

              Polygon -> (list)
                 Specifies a shape made up of up to 10 Point objects to define
                 a region of interest.

                 (structure)
                     The X and Y coordinates of a point on an image  or  video
                     frame. The X and Y values are ratios of the overall image
                     size or video resolution. For example, if an input  image
                     is  700x200 and the values are X=0.5 and Y=0.25, then the
                     point is at the (350,50) pixel coordinate on the image.

                     An array of Point objects makes up a Polygon . A  Polygon
                     is  returned  by   DetectText  and by  DetectCustomLabels
                     Polygon represents a fine-grained polygon  around  a  de-
                     tected  item.  For  more information, see Geometry in the
                     Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

                     X -> (float)
                        The value of the X coordinate for a point on a Polygon
                        .

                     Y -> (float)
                        The value of the Y coordinate for a point on a Polygon
                        .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BoundingBox={Width=float,Height=float,Left=float,Top=float},Polygon=[{X=float,Y=float},{X=float,Y=float}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

                "Height": float,
                "Left": float,

              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --data-sharing-preference-for-update (structure)
          Shows whether you are sharing data with Rekognition to improve model
          performance. You can choose this option at the account level or on a
          per-stream basis. Note that if you opt out at the account level this
          setting is ignored on individual streams.

          OptIn -> (boolean)
              If  this  option  is  set to true, you choose to share data with
              Rekognition to improve model performance.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OptIn=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

            "OptIn": true|false
          }

       --parameters-to-delete (list)
          A list of parameters you want to delete from the stream processor.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            ConnectedHomeMinConfidence
            RegionsOfInterest

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
