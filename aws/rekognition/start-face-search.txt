START-FACE-SEARCH()                                        START-FACE-SEARCH()



NAME
       start-face-search -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the asynchronous search for faces in a collection that match the
       faces of persons detected in a stored video.

       The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use  Video to  specify
       the  bucket name and the filename of the video. StartFaceSearch returns
       a job identifier (JobId ) which you use to get the search results  once
       the  search  has completed. When searching is finished, Amazon Rekogni-
       tion Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notifica-
       tion Service topic that you specify in NotificationChannel . To get the
       search results, first check that the status value published to the Ama-
       zon  SNS  topic  is SUCCEEDED . If so, call  GetFaceSearch and pass the
       job identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartFaceSearch .  For
       more information, see Searching stored videos for faces .

SYNOPSIS
            start-face-search
          --video <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--face-match-threshold <value>]
          --collection-id <value>
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The  video you want to search. The video must be stored in an Amazon
          S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the  ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent  token used to identify the start request. If you use the
          same token with multiple StartFaceSearch requests, the same JobId is
          returned.  Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from being
          accidently started more than once.

       --face-match-threshold (float)
          The minimum confidence in the person match to return.  For  example,
          don't  return  any  matches where confidence in matches is less than
          70%. The default value is 80%.

       --collection-id (string)
          ID of the collection that contains the faces you want to search for.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The ARN of the Amazon SNS topic to which you want Amazon Rekognition
          Video to publish the completion status of the search. The Amazon SNS
          topic must have a topic name that begins with  AmazonRekognition  if
          you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole permissions policy to
          access the topic.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon Rekognition posts the  com-
              pletion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An identifier you specify that's returned in the completion  notifi-
          cation  that's  published to your Amazon Simple Notification Service
          topic. For example, you can use JobTag to  group  related  jobs  and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  search  for  faces  in  a collection that match faces detected in a
       video

       The following start-face-search command starts  a  job  to  search  for
       faces  in a collection that match faces detected in the specified video
       file in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          aws rekognition start-face-search \
              --video "S3Object={Bucket=MyVideoS3Bucket,Name=MyVideoFile.mpg}" \
              --collection-id collection

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
          }

       For more information, see Searching Stored Videos for Faces in the Ama-
       zon Rekognition Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The  identifier for the search job. Use JobId to identify the job in
          a subsequent call to GetFaceSearch .
