OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data  Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains database
          definitions, table definitions, and  other  control  information  to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       DataLakeSettings -> (structure)
          A  structure representing a list of Lake Formation principals desig-
          nated as data lake administrators.

          DataLakeAdmins -> (list)
              A list of Lake Formation principals.  Supported  principals  are
              IAM users or IAM roles.

              (structure)
                 The  Lake  Formation  principal. Supported principals are IAM
                 users or IAM roles.

                 DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

          CreateDatabaseDefaultPermissions -> (list)
              Specifies whether access control on newly  created  database  is
              managed by Lake Formation permissions or exclusively by IAM per-
              missions. You can override this default setting when you  create
              a database.

              A  null value indicates access control by Lake Formation permis-
              sions. A value that assigns ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS  indi-
              cates  access control by IAM permissions. This is referred to as
              the setting "Use only IAM access control," and is  for  backward
              compatibility  with the Glue permission model implemented by IAM
              permissions.

              The only permitted values are an empty array or  an  array  that
              contains  a  single  JSON  object  that  grants  ALL  to IAM_AL-
              LOWED_PRINCIPALS.

              For more information, see Changing the Default Security Settings
              for Your Data Lake .

              (structure)
                 Permissions granted to a principal.

                 Principal -> (structure)
                     The principal who is granted permissions.

                     DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                        An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

                 Permissions -> (list)
                     The permissions that are granted to the principal.

                     (string)

          CreateTableDefaultPermissions -> (list)
              Specifies  whether access control on newly created table is man-
              aged by Lake Formation permissions or exclusively by IAM permis-
              sions.

              A  null value indicates access control by Lake Formation permis-
              sions. A value that assigns ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS  indi-
              cates  access control by IAM permissions. This is referred to as
              the setting "Use only IAM access control," and is  for  backward
              compatibility  with the Glue permission model implemented by IAM
              permissions.

              The only permitted values are an empty array or  an  array  that
              contains  a  single  JSON  object  that  grants  ALL  to IAM_AL-
              LOWED_PRINCIPALS.

              For more information, see Changing the Default Security Settings
              for Your Data Lake .

              (structure)
                 Permissions granted to a principal.

                 Principal -> (structure)
                     The principal who is granted permissions.

                     DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                        An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

                 Permissions -> (list)
                     The permissions that are granted to the principal.

                     (string)

          TrustedResourceOwners -> (list)
              A  list of the resource-owning account IDs that the caller's ac-
              count can use to share their user access  details  (user  ARNs).
              The  user  ARNs can be logged in the resource owner's CloudTrail
              log.

              You may want  to  specify  this  property  when  you  are  in  a
              high-trust boundary, such as the same team or company.

              (string)

          AllowExternalDataFiltering -> (boolean)
              Whether  to  allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data managed by
              Lake Formation.

              If true, you allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data in  Amazon
              S3 locations that are registered with Lake Formation.

              If  false or null, no Amazon EMR clusters will be able to access
              data in Amazon S3 locations that are registered with Lake Forma-
              tion.

              For  more  information,  see  (Optional) Allow Data Filtering on
              Amazon EMR .

          ExternalDataFilteringAllowList -> (list)
              A list of the account IDs of Amazon Web Services  accounts  with
              Amazon EMR clusters that are to perform data filtering.>

              (structure)
                 The  Lake  Formation  principal. Supported principals are IAM
                 users or IAM roles.

                 DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

          AuthorizedSessionTagValueList -> (list)
              Lake Formation relies on a privileged process secured by  Amazon
              EMR  or  the third party integrator to tag the user's role while
              assuming  it.  Lake  Formation  will  publish   the   acceptable
              key-value  pair,  for example key = "LakeFormationTrustedCaller"
              and value = "TRUE" and the third party integrator must  properly
              tag the temporary security credentials that will be used to call
              Lake Formation's administrative APIs.

              (string)
