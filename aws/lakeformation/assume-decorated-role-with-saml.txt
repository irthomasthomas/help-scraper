NAME
       assume-decorated-role-with-saml -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows a caller to assume an IAM role decorated as the SAML user speci-
       fied in the SAML assertion included in the request. This decoration al-
       lows  Lake  Formation to enforce access policies against the SAML users
       and groups. This API operation requires SAML federation  setup  in  the
       callers  account  as  it can only be called with valid SAML assertions.
       Lake Formation does not scope down the permission of the assumed  role.
       All permissions attached to the role via the SAML federation setup will
       be included in the role session.

       This decorated role is expected to access data in Amazon S3 by  getting
       temporary  access  from Lake Formation which is authorized via the vir-
       tual API GetDataAccess . Therefore, all SAML roles that can be  assumed
       via  AssumeDecoratedRoleWithSAML  must  at a minimum include lakeforma-
       tion:GetDataAccess in their role policies. A  typical  IAM  policy  at-
       tached to such a role would look as follows:

OPTIONS
       --saml-assertion (string)
          A  SAML  assertion consisting of an assertion statement for the user
          who needs temporary credentials. This must match the SAML  assertion
          that was issued to IAM. This must be Base64 encoded.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  role  that  represents an IAM principal whose scope down policy
          allows it to call credential vending APIs such as GetTemporaryTable-
          Credentials  .  The caller must also have iam:PassRole permission on
          this role.

       --principal-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SAML provider in IAM that  de-
          scribes the IdP.

       --duration-seconds (integer)
          The  time period, between 900 and 43,200 seconds, for the timeout of
          the temporary credentials.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AccessKeyId -> (string)
          The access key ID for the temporary  credentials.  (The  access  key
          consists of an access key ID and a secret key).

       SecretAccessKey -> (string)
          The  secret  key for the temporary credentials. (The access key con-
          sists of an access key ID and a secret key).

       SessionToken -> (string)
          The session token for the temporary credentials.

       Expiration -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the temporary credentials expire.
