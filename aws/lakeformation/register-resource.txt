REGISTER-RESOURCE()                                        REGISTER-RESOURCE()



NAME
       register-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers the resource as managed by the Data Catalog.

       To  add  or  update data, Lake Formation needs read/write access to the
       chosen Amazon S3 path. Choose a role that you know has permission to do
       this,   or  choose  the  AWSServiceRoleForLakeFormationDataAccess  ser-
       vice-linked role. When you register the first Amazon S3 path, the  ser-
       vice-linked  role  and  a new inline policy are created on your behalf.
       Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it
       to  the  service-linked  role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake
       Formation adds the path to the existing policy.

       The following request registers a new location and gives Lake Formation
       permission to use the service-linked role to access that location.
          ResourceArn = arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/ UseServiceLinkedRole = true

       If UseServiceLinkedRole is not set to true, you must provide or set the
       RoleArn :
          arn:aws:iam::12345:role/my-data-access-role

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that you want to reg-
          ister.

       --use-service-linked-role | --no-use-service-linked-role (boolean)
          Designates  an  Identity  and Access Management (IAM) service-linked
          role by  registering  this  role  with  the  Data  Catalog.  A  ser-
          vice-linked  role  is  a  unique type of IAM role that is linked di-
          rectly to Lake Formation.

          For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Lake Forma-
          tion .

       --role-arn (string)
          The identifier for the role that registers the resource.

       --with-federation | --no-with-federation (boolean)
          Whether or not the resource is a federated resource.

       --hybrid-access-enabled | --no-hybrid-access-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether the data access of tables pointing to the location
          can be managed by both Lake Formation permissions as well as  Amazon
          S3 bucket policies.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To register data lake storage using Service Linked Role

       The following register-resource example registers the resource as  man-
       aged by the Lake Formation using Service linked role.

          aws lakeformation register-resource \
              --cli-input-json file://input.json

       Contents of input.json:

          {
              "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::lf-emr-athena-result-123",
              "UseServiceLinkedRole": true
          }

       This command produces no output.

       For  more  information,  see  Adding an Amazon S3 location to your data
       lake in the AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide.

       Example 2: To register data lake storage using custom role

       The following register-resource example registers the resource as  man-
       aged by the Lake Formation using custom role.

          aws lakeformation register-resource \
              --cli-input-json file://input.json

       Contents of input.json:

          {
              "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::lf-emr-athena-result-123",
              "UseServiceLinkedRole": false,
              "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789111:role/LF-GlueServiceRole"
          }

       This command produces no output.

       lake in the AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide.
