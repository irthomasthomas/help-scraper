NAME
       put-data-lake-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the list of data lake administrators who have admin privileges on
       all resources managed by Lake Formation. For more information on  admin
       privileges, see Granting Lake Formation Permissions .

       This  API  replaces  the  current list of data lake admins with the new
       list being passed. To add an admin, fetch the current list and add  the
       new admin to that list and pass that list in this API.

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains  database
          definitions,  table  definitions,  and  other control information to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

       --data-lake-settings (structure)
          A structure representing a list of Lake Formation principals  desig-
          nated as data lake administrators.

          DataLakeAdmins -> (list)
              A  list  of  Lake Formation principals. Supported principals are
              IAM users or IAM roles.

              (structure)
                 The Lake Formation principal. Supported  principals  are  IAM
                 users or IAM roles.

                 DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

          ReadOnlyAdmins -> (list)
              A list of Lake Formation principals with only view access to the
              resources, without the ability to make changes. Supported  prin-
              cipals are IAM users or IAM roles.

              (structure)
                 The  Lake  Formation  principal. Supported principals are IAM
                 users or IAM roles.

                 DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

          CreateDatabaseDefaultPermissions -> (list)
              Specifies whether access control on newly  created  database  is
              managed by Lake Formation permissions or exclusively by IAM per-
              missions.

              A null value indicates access control by Lake Formation  permis-
              sions.  A value that assigns ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS indi-
              cates access control by IAM permissions. This is referred to  as
              the  setting  "Use only IAM access control," and is for backward
              compatibility with the Glue permission model implemented by  IAM
              permissions.

              The  only  permitted  values are an empty array or an array that
              contains a  single  JSON  object  that  grants  ALL  to  IAM_AL-
              LOWED_PRINCIPALS.

              For more information, see Changing the Default Security Settings
              for Your Data Lake .

              (structure)
                 Permissions granted to a principal.

                 Principal -> (structure)

                     DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                        An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

                 Permissions -> (list)
                     The permissions that are granted to the principal.

                     (string)

          CreateTableDefaultPermissions -> (list)
              Specifies whether access control on newly created table is  man-
              aged by Lake Formation permissions or exclusively by IAM permis-
              sions.

              A null value indicates access control by Lake Formation  permis-
              sions.  A value that assigns ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS indi-
              cates access control by IAM permissions. This is referred to  as
              the  setting  "Use only IAM access control," and is for backward
              compatibility with the Glue permission model implemented by  IAM
              permissions.

              The  only  permitted  values are an empty array or an array that
              contains a  single  JSON  object  that  grants  ALL  to  IAM_AL-
              LOWED_PRINCIPALS.

                     DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                        An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

                 Permissions -> (list)
                     The permissions that are granted to the principal.

                     (string)

          Parameters -> (map)
              A key-value map that provides  an  additional  configuration  on
              your data lake. CROSS_ACCOUNT_VERSION is the key you can config-
              ure in the Parameters field. Accepted values  for  the  CrossAc-
              countVersion key are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          TrustedResourceOwners -> (list)
              A  list of the resource-owning account IDs that the caller's ac-
              count can use to share their user access  details  (user  ARNs).
              The  user  ARNs can be logged in the resource owner's CloudTrail
              log.

              You may want  to  specify  this  property  when  you  are  in  a
              high-trust boundary, such as the same team or company.

              (string)

          AllowExternalDataFiltering -> (boolean)
              Whether  to  allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data managed by
              Lake Formation.

              If true, you allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data in  Amazon
              S3 locations that are registered with Lake Formation.

              If  false or null, no Amazon EMR clusters will be able to access
              data in Amazon S3 locations that are registered with Lake Forma-
              tion.

              For more information, see (Optional) Allow external data filter-
              ing .

          AllowFullTableExternalDataAccess -> (boolean)
              Whether to allow a third-party query engine to get  data  access
              credentials without session tags when a caller has full data ac-
              cess permissions.

          ExternalDataFilteringAllowList -> (list)
              A list of the account IDs of Amazon Web Services  accounts  with
              Amazon EMR clusters that are to perform data filtering.>

              (structure)
                 The  Lake  Formation  principal. Supported principals are IAM
                 users or IAM roles.

                 DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

          AuthorizedSessionTagValueList -> (list)
              Lake Formation relies on a privileged process secured by  Amazon
              EMR  or  the third party integrator to tag the user's role while
              assuming  it.  Lake  Formation  will  publish   the   acceptable
              key-value  pair,  for example key = "LakeFormationTrustedCaller"
              and value = "TRUE" and the third party integrator must  properly
              tag the temporary security credentials that will be used to call
              Lake Formation's administrative APIs.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set AWS Lake Formation-managed data lake settings

       The following put-data-lake-settings example sets the list of data lake
       administrators and other data lake settings.
