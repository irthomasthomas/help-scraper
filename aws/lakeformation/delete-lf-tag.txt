DELETE-LF-TAG()                                                DELETE-LF-TAG()



NAME
       delete-lf-tag -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified LF-tag given a key name. If the input parameter
       tag key was not found, then the operation will throw an exception. When
       you  delete  an  LF-tag, the LFTagPolicy attached to the LF-tag becomes
       invalid. If the deleted LF-tag was still assigned to any resource,  the
       tag  policy  attach  to the deleted LF-tag will no longer be applied to
       the resource.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-lf-tag
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --tag-key <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data  Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains database
          definitions, table definitions, and  other  control  information  to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

       --tag-key (string)
          The key-name for the LF-tag to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
