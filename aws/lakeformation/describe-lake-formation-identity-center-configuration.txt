OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains  database
          definitions,  table  definitions,  and  other control information to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       CatalogId -> (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data  Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains database
          definitions, table definitions, and  other  control  information  to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

       InstanceArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the connection.

       ApplicationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lake Formation application in-
          tegrated with IAM Identity Center.

       ExternalFiltering -> (structure)

          Status -> (string)
              Allows to enable or disable the  third-party  applications  that
              are allowed to access data managed by Lake Formation.

          AuthorizedTargets -> (list)
              List of third-party application ARNs integrated with Lake Forma-
              tion.

              (string)

       ShareRecipients -> (list)
          A list of Amazon Web Services account IDs or Amazon Web Services or-
          ganization/organizational  unit ARNs that are allowed to access data
          managed by Lake Formation.

          If the ShareRecipients list includes valid values, a resource  share
          is  created  with  the principals you want to have access to the re-
          sources as the ShareRecipients .

          If the ShareRecipients value is null or the list is  empty,  no  re-
          source share is created.

          (structure)
              The Lake Formation principal. Supported principals are IAM users
              or IAM roles.

              DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

       ResourceShare -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the RAM share.
