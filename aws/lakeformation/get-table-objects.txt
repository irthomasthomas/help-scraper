OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  catalog  containing the governed table. Defaults to the callers
          account.

       --database-name (string)
          The database containing the governed table.

       --table-name (string)
          The governed table for which to retrieve objects.

       --transaction-id (string)
          The transaction ID at which to read the governed table contents.  If
          this  transaction has aborted, an error is returned. If not set, de-
          faults to the most recent committed transaction. Cannot be specified
          along with QueryAsOfTime .

       --query-as-of-time (timestamp)
          The time as of when to read the governed table contents. If not set,
          the most recent transaction commit time is used. Cannot be specified
          along with TransactionId .

       --partition-predicate (string)
          A  predicate  to  filter the objects returned based on the partition
          keys defined in the governed table.

          o The comparison operators supported are: =, >, <, >=, <=

          o The logical operators supported are: AND

          o The data types  supported  are  integer,  long,  date(yyyy-MM-dd),
            timestamp(yyyy-MM-dd  HH:mm:ssXXX or yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"), string
            and decimal.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies how many values to return in a page.

       --next-token (string)
          A continuation token if this is not the first call to retrieve these
          objects.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list objects of governed table

       The  following  get-table-objects  example returns the set of Amazon S3
       objects that make up the specified governed table.
