NAME
       list-edge-agent-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array of edge configurations associated with the specified
       Edge Agent.

       In the request, you must specify the Edge Agent HubDeviceArn .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-edge-agent-configurations is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: EdgeConfigs

OPTIONS
       --hub-device-arn (string)
          The "Internet of Things (IoT) Thing" Arn of the edge agent.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                        DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The  total  duration  to  record the media. If the
                            ScheduleExpression attribute is provided, then the
                            DurationInSeconds  attribute should also be speci-
                            fied.

                 UploaderConfig -> (structure)
                     The uploader configuration contains  the  ScheduleExpres-
                     sion  details  that  are used to schedule upload jobs for
                     the recorded media files from the Edge Agent to a Kinesis
                     Video Stream.

                     ScheduleConfig -> (structure)
                        The configuration that consists of the ScheduleExpres-
                        sion and the DurationInMinutes  details  that  specify
                        the scheduling to record from a camera, or local media
                        file, onto the Edge Agent. If  the  ScheduleConfig  is
                        not  provided  in  this UploaderConfig , then the Edge
                        Agent will upload at regular intervals (every 1 hour).

                        ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                            The Quartz cron  expression  that  takes  care  of

                        DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The  total  duration  to  record the media. If the
                            ScheduleExpression attribute is provided, then the
                            DurationInSeconds  attribute should also be speci-
                            fied.

                 DeletionConfig -> (structure)
                     The deletion configuration is made up  of  the  retention
                     time (EdgeRetentionInHours ) and local size configuration
                     (LocalSizeConfig ) details that  are  used  to  make  the
                     deletion.

                     EdgeRetentionInHours -> (integer)
                        The  number  of hours that you want to retain the data
                        in the stream on the Edge Agent. The default value  of
                        the  retention  time is 720 hours, which translates to
                        30 days.

                     LocalSizeConfig -> (structure)
                        The value of the  local  size  required  in  order  to
                        delete the edge configuration.

                        MaxLocalMediaSizeInMB -> (integer)
                            The  overall  maximum  size  of the media that you
                            want to store for a stream on the Edge Agent.

                        StrategyOnFullSize -> (string)
                            The strategy to perform when a streams MaxLocalMe-
                            diaSizeInMB limit is reached.

                     DeleteAfterUpload -> (boolean)
                        The  boolean value used to indicate whether or not you
                        want to mark the media for deletion, once it has  been
                        uploaded  to the Kinesis Video Stream cloud. The media
                        files can be deleted if any of the deletion configura-
                        tion  values  are set to true , such as when the limit
                        for the EdgeRetentionInHours , or  the  MaxLocalMedia-
                        SizeInMB , has been reached.

                        Since the default value is set to true , configure the
                        uploader schedule such that the media  files  are  not
                        being  deleted  before  they are initially uploaded to
                        the Amazon Web Services cloud.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, the call returns this element  with  a
          given  token. To get the next batch of edge configurations, use this
          token in your next request.
