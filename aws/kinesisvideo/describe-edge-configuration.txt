DESCRIBE-EDGE-CONFIGURATION()                    DESCRIBE-EDGE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       describe-edge-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  streams  edge configuration that was set using the Start-
       EdgeConfigurationUpdate API and the latest status of the  edge  agent's
       recorder  and uploader jobs. Use this API to get the status of the con-
       figuration to determine if the configuration is in sync with  the  Edge
       Agent. Use this API to evaluate the health of the Edge Agent.

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The  name of the stream whose edge configuration you want to update.
          Specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN .

       --stream-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  stream.  Specify  either  the
          StreamName or the StreamARN .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

                 record  from  a  camera,  or  local media file, onto the Edge
                 Agent. If the ScheduleExpression attribute is  not  provided,
                 then the Edge Agent will always be set to recording mode.

                 ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                     The  Quartz cron expression that takes care of scheduling
                     jobs to record from the camera, or local media file, onto

                     onds attribute should also be specified.

          UploaderConfig -> (structure)
              The uploader configuration contains the  ScheduleExpression  de-

                 The configuration that consists of the ScheduleExpression and

                 record from a camera, or local  media  file,  onto  the  Edge
                 Agent.  If the ScheduleConfig is not provided in this Upload-
                 erConfig , then the Edge Agent will upload at regular  inter-
                 vals (every 1 hour).

                     for the RecorderConfig , then the Edge Agent will  always
                     be set to recording mode.

                 DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The total duration to record the media. If the  Schedule-
                     Expression attribute is provided, then the DurationInSec-
                     onds attribute should also be specified.

          DeletionConfig -> (structure)
              The deletion configuration is made  up  of  the  retention  time
              (EdgeRetentionInHours ) and local size configuration (LocalSize-
              Config ) details that are used to make the deletion.

              EdgeRetentionInHours -> (integer)
                 The number of hours that you want to retain the data  in  the
                 stream  on the Edge Agent. The default value of the retention
                 time is 720 hours, which translates to 30 days.

              LocalSizeConfig -> (structure)
                 The value of the local size required in order to  delete  the
                 edge configuration.

                     The  overall  maximum  size of the media that you want to
                     store for a stream on the Edge Agent.

                 StrategyOnFullSize -> (string)
                     The strategy to perform  when  a  streams  MaxLocalMedia-
                     SizeInMB limit is reached.

              DeleteAfterUpload -> (boolean)
                 The boolean value used to indicate whether or not you want to
                 mark the media for deletion, once it has been uploaded to the
                 Kinesis Video Stream cloud. The media files can be deleted if
                 any of the deletion configuration values are set  to  true  ,
                 such  as when the limit for the EdgeRetentionInHours , or the
                 MaxLocalMediaSizeInMB , has been reached.

                 Since the default value is set to true ,  configure  the  up-
                 loader  schedule  such  that  the  media  files are not being
                 deleted before they are initially uploaded to the Amazon  Web
                 Services cloud.
