NAME
       start-edge-configuration-update -

DESCRIPTION
       An asynchronous API that updates a streams existing edge configuration.
       The Kinesis Video Stream will sync the streams edge configuration  with
       the Edge Agent IoT Greengrass component that runs on an IoT Hub Device,
       setup at your premise. The time to sync can vary  and  depends  on  the
       connectivity  of  the Hub Device. The SyncStatus will be updated as the
       edge configuration is acknowledged, and synced with the Edge Agent.

       If this API is invoked for the first time,  a  new  edge  configuration
       will  be  created  for  the  stream, and the sync status will be set to
       SYNCING . You will have to wait for the sync status to reach a terminal
       state  such as: IN_SYNC , or SYNC_FAILED , before using this API again.
       If you invoke this API during the syncing process,  a  ResourceInUseEx-
       ception will be thrown. The connectivity of the streams edge configura-
       tion and the Edge Agent will be retried for 15 minutes. After  15  min-
       utes, the status will transition into the SYNC_FAILED state.

                 The configuration details that consist of the credentials re-
                 quired  (MediaUriSecretArn  and  MediaUriType ) to access the
                 media files streamed to the camera.

                 DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  total duration to record the media. If the Schedule-

                 The  number  of hours that you want to retain the data in the
                 stream on the Edge Agent. The default value of the  retention
                 time is 720 hours, which translates to 30 days.

                     The  strategy  to  perform  when a streams MaxLocalMedia-
                     SizeInMB limit is reached.

                 The boolean value used to indicate whether or not you want to
                 mark the media for deletion, once it has been uploaded to the
                 Kinesis Video Stream cloud. The media files can be deleted if
                 any  of  the  deletion configuration values are set to true ,
                 such as when the limit for the EdgeRetentionInHours , or  the
                 MaxLocalMediaSizeInMB , has been reached.

                 Since  the  default  value is set to true , configure the up-
                 loader schedule such that  the  media  files  are  not  being
                 deleted before they are initially uploaded to AWS cloud.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 StrategyOnFullSize -> (string)
                     The  strategy  to  perform  when a streams MaxLocalMedia-
                     SizeInMB limit is reached.

              DeleteAfterUpload -> (boolean)
                 The boolean value used to indicate whether or not you want to
                 mark the media for deletion, once it has been uploaded to the
                 Kinesis Video Stream cloud. The media files can be deleted if
                 any  of  the  deletion configuration values are set to true ,
                 such as when the limit for the EdgeRetentionInHours , or  the
                 MaxLocalMediaSizeInMB , has been reached.

                 Since  the  default  value is set to true , configure the up-
                 loader schedule such that  the  media  files  are  not  being
                 deleted before they are initially uploaded to AWS cloud.
