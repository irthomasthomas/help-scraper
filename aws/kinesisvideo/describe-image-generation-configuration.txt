NAME
       describe-image-generation-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the ImageGenerationConfiguration for a given Kinesis video stream.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-image-generation-configuration
          [--stream-name <value>]
          [--stream-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The  name  of the stream from which to retrieve the image generation
          configuration. You must specify either the StreamName or the  Strea-
          mARN .

       --stream-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the Kinesis video stream from
          which to retrieve the image generation configuration. You must spec-
          ify either the StreamName or the StreamARN .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ImageGenerationConfiguration -> (structure)
          The structure that contains the information required for the Kinesis
          video  stream  (KVS) images delivery. If this structure is null, the
          configuration will be deleted from the stream.

          Status -> (string)
              Indicates  whether  the  ContinuousImageGenerationConfigurations
              API is enabled or disabled.

          ImageSelectorType -> (string)
              The origin of the Server or Producer timestamps to use to gener-
              ate the images.

          DestinationConfig -> (structure)
              The structure that contains the information required to  deliver
              images to a customer.

              Uri -> (string)
                 The  Uniform  Resource  Idenifier (URI) that identifies where
                 the images will be delivered.

              DestinationRegion -> (string)
                 The AWS Region of the S3 bucket where images will  be  deliv-
                 ered.  This DestinationRegion must match the Region where the
                 stream is located.

          SamplingInterval -> (integer)
              The time interval in milliseconds (ms) at which the images  need
              to  be  generated from the stream. The minimum value that can be
              provided is 33 ms, because a camera that generates content at 30
              FPS  would  create a frame every 33.3 ms. If the timestamp range
              is less than the sampling interval, the Image  from  the  Start-
              Timestamp will be returned if available.

          Format -> (string)
              The accepted image format.

          FormatConfig -> (map)
              The  list  of a key-value pair structure that contains extra pa-
              rameters that can be applied when the image  is  generated.  The
              FormatConfig  key  is the JPEGQuality , which indicates the JPEG
              quality key to be used to generate the image.  The  FormatConfig
              value  accepts  ints from 1 to 100. If the value is 1, the image
              will be generated with less quality and the best compression. If
              the  value  is  100,  the  image will be generated with the best
              quality and less compression. If no value is provided,  the  de-
              fault value of the JPEGQuality key will be set to 80.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          WidthPixels -> (integer)
              The  width  of the output image that is used in conjunction with
              the HeightPixels parameter. When both WidthPixels and HeightPix-
              els  parameters are provided, the image will be stretched to fit
              the specified aspect ratio. If only the WidthPixels parameter is
              provided,  its  original  aspect ratio will be used to calculate
              the HeightPixels ratio. If neither parameter  is  provided,  the
              original image size will be returned.

          HeightPixels -> (integer)
              The  height of the output image that is used in conjunction with
              the WidthPixels parameter. When both HeightPixels and  WidthPix-
              els  parameters are provided, the image will be stretched to fit
              the specified aspect ratio. If only the  HeightPixels  parameter
              is provided, its original aspect ratio will be used to calculate
              the WidthPixels ratio. If neither  parameter  is  provided,  the
              original image size will be returned.
