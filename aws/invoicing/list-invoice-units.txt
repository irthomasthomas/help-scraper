LIST-INVOICE-UNITS()                                      LIST-INVOICE-UNITS()



NAME
       list-invoice-units -

DESCRIPTION
       This  fetches  a  list  of all invoice unit definitions for a given ac-
       count, as of the provided AsOf date.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-invoice-units is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: InvoiceUnits

OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          An  optional  input  to the list API. If multiple filters are speci-
          fied, the returned list will be a configuration that  match  all  of
          the  provided filters. Supported filter types are InvoiceReceivers ,
          Names , and Accounts .

          Names -> (list)
              An optional input to the list API. You can specify a list of in-
              voice  unit  names  inside  filters to return invoice units that
              match only the specified invoice unit names. If  multiple  names
              are  provided,  the result is an OR condition (match any) of the
              specified invoice unit names.

              (string)

          InvoiceReceivers -> (list)
              You can specify a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs inside
              filters  to  return  invoice units that match only the specified
              accounts. If multiple accounts are provided, the result is an OR
              condition  (match  any)  of  the specified accounts. This filter
              only matches the specified accounts on the invoice receivers  of
              the invoice units.

              (string)

          Accounts -> (list)
              You can specify a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs inside
              filters to return invoice units that match  only  the  specified
              accounts. If multiple accounts are provided, the result is an OR
              condition (match any) of the specified accounts.  The  specified
              account  IDs  are matched with either the receiver or the linked
              accounts in the rules.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Names=string,string,InvoiceReceivers=string,string,Accounts=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Names": ["string", ...],
            "InvoiceReceivers": ["string", ...],
            "Accounts": ["string", ...]
          }

       --as-of (timestamp)
          The state of an invoice unit at a specified time. You can see legacy
          invoice  units that are currently deleted if the AsOf time is set to
          before it was deleted. If an AsOf is not provided, the default value
          is the current time.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
