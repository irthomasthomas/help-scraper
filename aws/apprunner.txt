NAME
       apprunner -

DESCRIPTION
       App  Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and
       cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container  image  or
       source  code  to  a running service in the Amazon Web Services Cloud in
       seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute
       service to use, or understand how to provision and configure Amazon Web
       Services resources.

       App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source  code
       repository.  It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully man-
       aged operations, high performance, scalability, and security.

       For more information about App Runner, see  the  App  Runner  Developer
       Guide . For release information, see the App Runner Release Notes .

       To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development
       Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use  to
       access the API, see Tools for Amazon Web Services .
          Endpoints
