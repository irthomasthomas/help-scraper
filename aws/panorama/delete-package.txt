NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a package.

       NOTE:
          To  delete a package, you need permission to call s3:DeleteObject in
          addition to permissions for the AWS Panorama API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-package
          [--force-delete | --no-force-delete]
          --package-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --force-delete | --no-force-delete (boolean)
          Delete the package even if it has artifacts  stored  in  its  access
          point. Deletes the package's artifacts from Amazon S3.

       --package-id (string)
          The package's ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
