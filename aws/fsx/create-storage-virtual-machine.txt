OPTIONS
       --active-directory-configuration (structure)
          Describes the self-managed Microsoft Active Directory to  which  you
          want  to join the SVM. Joining an Active Directory provides user au-
          thentication and access control for SMB clients, including Microsoft
          Windows and macOS clients accessing the file system.

          NetBiosName -> (string)
              The  NetBIOS  name  of the Active Directory computer object that
              will be created for your SVM.

          SelfManagedActiveDirectoryConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration that Amazon FSx uses to join a FSx for Windows
              File  Server file system or an FSx for ONTAP storage virtual ma-
              chine (SVM) to a self-managed (including on-premises)  Microsoft
              Active Directory (AD) directory. For more information, see Using
              Amazon FSx for Windows with your self-managed  Microsoft  Active
              Directory or Managing FSx for ONTAP SVMs .

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The fully qualified domain name of the self-managed AD direc-
                 tory, such as corp.example.com .

              OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName -> (string)
                 (Optional) The fully qualified distinguished name of the  or-
                 ganizational unit within your self-managed AD directory. Ama-
                 zon FSx only accepts OU as the direct parent of the file sys-
                 tem.  An  example is OU=FSx,DC=yourdomain,DC=corp,DC=com . To
                 learn more, see RFC 2253 . If none is provided, the FSx  file
                 system  is  created in the default location of your self-man-
                 aged AD directory.

                 WARNING:
                     Only Organizational Unit (OU) objects can be  the  direct
                     parent of the file system that you're creating.

              FileSystemAdministratorsGroup -> (string)
                 (Optional)  The  name  of  the domain group whose members are

                 istrative  privileges  include  taking ownership of files and
                 folders, setting audit controls (audit  ACLs)  on  files  and
                 folders,  and administering the file system remotely by using
                 the FSx Remote PowerShell. The group that  you  specify  must
                 already  exist in your domain. If you don't provide one, your
                 AD domain's Domain Admins group is used.

                 domain  that  Amazon  FSx will use to join to your AD domain.
                 This account must have the permission to  join  computers  to
                 the  domain  in the organizational unit provided in Organiza-
                 tionalUnitDistinguishedName , or in the default  location  of
                 your AD domain.

                 the  corresponding  tag key. Tag values can be null and don't
                 have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can  have  a
                 key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances : April and also of

            trator, the majority of users are SMB clients, and an  application
            accessing  the  data  uses a Microsoft Windows user as the service

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
