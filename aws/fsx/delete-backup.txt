DELETE-BACKUP()                                                DELETE-BACKUP()



NAME
       delete-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an Amazon FSx backup. After deletion, the backup no longer ex-
       ists, and its data is gone.

       The DeleteBackup call returns instantly. The backup won't  show  up  in
       later DescribeBackups calls.

       WARNING:
          The  data in a deleted backup is also deleted and can't be recovered
          by any means.

OPTIONS
       --backup-id (string)
          The ID of the backup that you want to delete.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A string of up to 63 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure
          idempotent  deletion. This parameter is automatically filled on your
          behalf when using the CLI or SDK.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.
