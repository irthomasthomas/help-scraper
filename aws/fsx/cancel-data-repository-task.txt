NAME
       cancel-data-repository-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels  an existing Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository task if that
       task is in either the PENDING or EXECUTING state. When  you  cancel  am
       export task, Amazon FSx does the following.

       o Any files that FSx has already exported are not reverted.

       o FSx  continues to export any files that are in-flight when the cancel
         operation is received.

       o FSx does not export any files that have not yet been exported.

       For a release task, Amazon FSx will stop releasing files upon cancella-
       tion.  Any files that have already been released will remain in the re-
       leased state.

OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          Specifies the data repository task to cancel.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Lifecycle -> (string)
          The lifecycle status of the data repository task, as follows:

          o PENDING - Amazon FSx has not started the task.

          o EXECUTING - Amazon FSx is processing the task.

          o FAILED - Amazon FSx was not able to complete the task.  For  exam-
            ple,   there  may  be  files  the  task  failed  to  process.  The
            DataRepositoryTaskFailureDetails property provides  more  informa-
            tion about task failures.

          o SUCCEEDED - FSx completed the task successfully.

          o CANCELED - Amazon FSx canceled the task and it did not complete.
