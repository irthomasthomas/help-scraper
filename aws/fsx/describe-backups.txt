DESCRIBE-BACKUPS()                                          DESCRIBE-BACKUPS()



NAME
       describe-backups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the description of a specific Amazon FSx backup, if a BackupIds
       value is provided for that backup. Otherwise, it  returns  all  backups
       owned  by  your  Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services
       Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

       When retrieving all backups, you can optionally specify the  MaxResults
       parameter to limit the number of backups in a response. If more backups
       remain, Amazon FSx returns a NextToken value in the response.  In  this
       case,  send a later request with the NextToken request parameter set to
       the value of the NextToken value from the last response.

       This operation is used in an iterative process to retrieve  a  list  of
       your  backups.  DescribeBackups  is  called  first  without a NextToken
       value. Then the operation continues to be called with the NextToken pa-
       rameter  set  to the value of the last NextToken value until a response
       has no NextToken value.

       When using this operation, keep the following in mind:

       o The operation might return fewer than the MaxResults value of  backup
         descriptions while still including a NextToken value.

       o The  order  of  the  backups  returned  in  the  response  of one De-
         scribeBackups call and the order of the backups returned  across  the
         responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-backups  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Backups

OPTIONS
       --backup-ids (list)
          The IDs of the backups that you want  to  retrieve.  This  parameter
          value  overrides  any filters. If any IDs aren't found, a BackupNot-
          Found error occurs.

          (string)
              The ID of the source backup. Specifies the backup that  you  are
              copying.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          The  filters  structure.  The  supported  names are file-system-id ,
          backup-type , file-system-type , and volume-id .

          (structure)
              A filter used to restrict the results of describe calls. You can
              use  multiple  filters  to  return results that meet all applied
              filter requirements.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name for this filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of the filter. These are all the values for any of
                 the applied filters.

                 (string)
                     The value for a filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "file-system-id"|"backup-type"|"file-system-type"|"volume-id"|"data-repository-type"|"file-cache-id"|"file-cache-type",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                       File Server only) The file system is currently unavail-
                       able  due to a change in your Active Directory configu-
                       ration.

                     o UPDATING  -  The  file  system  is  undergoing  a  cus-
                       tomer-initiated update.

                 FailureDetails -> (structure)
                     A  structure  providing  details of any failures that oc-
                     curred.

                     Message -> (string)
                        A message describing any failures that occurred.

                 StorageCapacity -> (integer)

                     (GiB).

                 StorageType -> (string)
                     The  type  of storage the file system is using. If set to
                     SSD , the file system uses solid state drive storage.  If
                     set  to  HDD , the file system uses hard disk drive stor-
                     age.

                 VpcId -> (string)
                     The ID of the primary virtual private cloud (VPC) for the

                 SubnetIds -> (list)
                     Specifies  the IDs of the subnets that the file system is
                     accessible from. For the Amazon  FSx  Windows  and  ONTAP
                     MULTI_AZ_1  file  system  deployment  type, there are two
                     subnet IDs, one for the preferred file server and one for
                     the standby file server. The preferred file server subnet
                     identified in the PreferredSubnetID property.  All  other
                     file systems have only one subnet ID.

                     For  FSx  for  Lustre file systems, and Single-AZ Windows
                     file systems, this is the ID of the subnet that  contains
                     the  file  system's  endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1 Windows and
                     ONTAP file systems, the file system endpoint is available
                     in the PreferredSubnetID .

                     (string)
                        The  ID  for  a  subnet. A subnet is a range of IP ad-
                        dresses in your virtual private cloud (VPC). For  more
                        information,  see  VPC  and  subnets in the Amazon VPC
                        User Guide.

                 NetworkInterfaceIds -> (list)
                     The IDs of the elastic network interfaces  from  which  a
                     specific  file  system is accessible. The elastic network
                     interface is automatically created in  the  same  virtual
                     private  cloud  (VPC) that the Amazon FSx file system was
                     created in. For more information, see Elastic Network In-
                     terfaces in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

                     For  an  Amazon  FSx for Windows File Server file system,
                     you can have one network interface ID. For an Amazon  FSx
                     for Lustre file system, you can have more than one.

                     (string)
                        An  elastic  network  interface ID. An elastic network
                        interface is a logical networking component in a  vir-
                        tual  private  cloud  (VPC)  that represents a virtual
                        network card. For more information, see  Elastic  Net-
                        work Interfaces in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux
                        Instances .

                 DNSName -> (string)
                     The Domain Name System (DNS) name for the file system.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     The ID of the Key Management Service (KMS)  key  used  to
                     encrypt Amazon FSx file system data. Used as follows with
                     Amazon FSx file system types:

                     o Amazon FSx for Lustre PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 de-
                       ployment types only.  SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2 types are
                       encrypted using the Amazon FSx service KMS key for your
                       account.

                     o Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

                     o Amazon FSx for OpenZFS

                     o Amazon FSx for Windows File Server

                 ResourceARN -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the file system re-
                     source.

                        Linux SMB clients or Windows SMB clients that are  not
                        joined to a Microsoft Active Directory. Applicable for
                        all Windows file system deployment types. This IP  ad-
                        dress  is temporarily unavailable when the file system
                        is undergoing maintenance. For Linux and  Windows  SMB
                        clients  that  are  joined to an Active Directory, use
                        the file system's DNSName instead. For  more  informa-
                        tion   on   mapping  and  mounting  file  shares,  see

                        The  number  of days to retain automatic backups. Set-
                        ting this to 0 disables automatic backups. You can re-
                        tain automatic backups for a maximum of 90 days.

                     CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                        A  boolean  flag  indicating  whether tags on the file
                        system should be copied to  backups.  This  value  de-
                        faults  to false. If it's set to true, all tags on the
                        file system are copied to all  automatic  backups  and
                        any  user-initiated  backups  where  the  user doesn't
                        specify any tags. If this value is true, and you spec-
                        ify  one  or  more  tags,  only the specified tags are
                        copied to backups. If you specify  one  or  more  tags
                        when  creating  a  user-initiated  backup, no tags are
                        copied from the file system, regardless of this value.

                        An array of one or more DNS aliases that are currently
                        associated  with  the  Amazon FSx file system. Aliases
                        allow you to use existing DNS names to access the data
                        in  your  Amazon FSx file system. You can associate up
                        to 50 aliases with a file system at any time. You  can
                        associate  additional DNS aliases after you create the
                        file system using the AssociateFileSystemAliases oper-
                        ation. You can remove DNS aliases from the file system
                        after it is  created  using  the  DisassociateFileSys-
                        temAliases  operation.  You  only  need to specify the
                        alias name in the request payload. For  more  informa-

                            tem  using  user-defined DNS names, in addition to
                            the default DNS name that Amazon  FSx  assigns  to
                            the  file  system.  For  more information, see DNS
                            aliases in the FSx for Windows  File  Server  User

                     The configuration for the Amazon FSx for Lustre file sys-
                     tem.

                     WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                        The preferred start time  to  perform  weekly  mainte-
                        nance, formatted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone. Here, d
                        is the weekday number, from  1  through  7,  beginning
                        with Monday and ending with Sunday.

                     DataRepositoryConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  data  repository  configuration object for Lustre
                        file systems returned in the response of  the  Create-
                        FileSystem operation.

                        This data type is not supported on file systems with a
                        data repository association. For file systems  with  a
                        data repository association, see .

                        Lifecycle -> (string)
                            Describes  the  state  of  the  file  system's  S3
                            durable data repository, if it is configured  with
                            an  S3 repository. The lifecycle can have the fol-
                            lowing values:

                            o CREATING - The data repository configuration be-
                              tween the FSx file system and the linked S3 data
                              repository is being created. The data repository
                              is unavailable.

                            o AVAILABLE - The data repository is available for
                              use.

                            o MISCONFIGURED - Amazon FSx cannot  automatically
                              import updates from the S3 bucket until the data
                              repository configuration is corrected. For  more
                              information, see Troubleshooting a Misconfigured
                              linked S3 bucket .

                            o UPDATING - The data repository is  undergoing  a
                              customer  initiated  update and availability may
                              be impacted.

                            o FAILED - The data repository is  in  a  terminal
                              state that cannot be recovered.

                        ImportPath -> (string)
                            The  import  path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and op-
                            tional prefix)  that  you're  using  as  the  data
                            repository  for  your  FSx for Lustre file system,
                            for example  s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix  .
                            If  a  prefix  is  specified  after  the Amazon S3
                            bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are
                            loaded into the file system.

                        ExportPath -> (string)
                            The  export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and pre-
                            fix) that you are using to store new  and  changed
                            Lustre file system files in S3.

                        ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                            For  files  imported  from a data repository, this
                            value determines  the  stripe  count  and  maximum
                            amount  of data per file (in MiB) stored on a sin-
                            gle physical disk. The  maximum  number  of  disks
                            that  a  single file can be striped across is lim-
                            ited by the total number of disks that make up the
                            file system.

                            The  default  chunk  size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and
                            can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3
                            objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                        AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                            Describes the file system's linked S3 data reposi-
                            tory's  AutoImportPolicy  .  The  AutoImportPolicy
                            configures  how Amazon FSx keeps your file and di-
                            rectory listings up to date as you add  or  modify
                            objects in your linked S3 bucket. AutoImportPolicy
                            can have the following values:

                            o NONE - (Default) AutoImport is off.  Amazon  FSx
                              only  updates  file  and directory listings from
                              the linked S3 bucket when  the  file  system  is
                              created.  FSx does not update file and directory
                              listings for any new or  changed  objects  after
                              choosing this option.

                            o NEW - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically
                              imports directory listings of  any  new  objects
                              added  to  the linked S3 bucket that do not cur-
                              rently exist in the FSx file system.

                            o NEW_CHANGED - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx auto-
                              matically imports file and directory listings of
                              any new objects added to the S3 bucket  and  any
                              existing  objects  that  are  changed  in the S3
                              bucket after you choose this option.

                            o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED - AutoImport is  on.  Amazon
                              FSx  automatically  imports  file  and directory
                              listings of any new  objects  added  to  the  S3
                              bucket, any existing objects that are changed in
                              the S3 bucket, and any objects that were deleted
                              in the S3 bucket.

                        FailureDetails -> (structure)
                            Provides   detailed  information  about  the  data
                            repository if its Lifecycle is set  to  MISCONFIG-
                            URED or FAILED .

                            Message -> (string)
                               A detailed error message.

                     DeploymentType -> (string)
                        The deployment type of the FSx for Lustre file system.
                        Scratch deployment  type  is  designed  for  temporary
                        storage and shorter-term processing of data.
                            SCRATCH_1  and SCRATCH_2 deployment types are best
                            suited for when you  need  temporary  storage  and
                            shorter-term processing of data. The SCRATCH_2 de-
                            ployment type provides  in-transit  encryption  of
                            data  and  higher  burst  throughput capacity than
                            SCRATCH_1 .

                        The PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment  type  is
                        used for longer-term storage and workloads and encryp-
                        tion of data in transit. PERSISTENT_2 is built on Lus-
                        tre  v2.12  and offers higher PerUnitStorageThroughput
                        (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB) along with a lower minimum stor-
                        age  capacity  requirement  (600  GiB).  To learn more
                        about FSx for Lustre deployment  types,  see  FSx  for
                        Lustre deployment options .

                        The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                     PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                        Per  unit  storage throughput represents the megabytes
                        per second of read or write throughput per 1  tebibyte
                        of  storage provisioned. File system throughput capac-
                        ity is equal to Storage capacity (TiB) *  PerUnitStor-
                        ageThroughput  (MB/s/TiB).  This  option is only valid
                        for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment types.

                        Valid values:

                        o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                        o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                        o For PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage: 125, 250, 500, 1000.

                     MountName -> (string)
                        You use the MountName value  when  mounting  the  file
                        system.

                        For  the  SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value is al-
                        ways "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 ,  and  PER-
                        SISTENT_2  deployment  types,  this  value is a string
                        that is unique within an Amazon Web Services Region.

                     DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                        A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM  .  HH  is
                        the  zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM is the
                        zero-padded minute of the  hour.  For  example,  05:00
                        specifies 5 AM daily.

                     AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                        The  number  of days to retain automatic backups. Set-
                        ting this property to 0  disables  automatic  backups.
                        You  can  retain automatic backups for a maximum of 90
                        days. The default is 30 .

                     CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                        A boolean flag indicating whether  tags  on  the  file
                        system are copied to backups. If it's set to true, all
                        tags on the file system are copied  to  all  automatic
                        backups  and any user-initiated backups where the user
                        doesn't specify any tags. If this value is  true,  and
                        you  specify one or more tags, only the specified tags
                        are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags
                        when  creating  a  user-initiated  backup, no tags are
                        copied from the file system, regardless of this value.
                        (Default = false)

                     DriveCacheType -> (string)
                        The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file sys-
                        tems that are provisioned with  HDD  storage  devices.
                        This  parameter  is  required when StorageType is HDD.
                        When set to READ the file system has  an  SSD  storage
                        cache  that is sized to 20% of the file system's stor-
                        age capacity. This improves the performance  for  fre-
                        quently accessed files by caching up to 20% of the to-
                        tal storage capacity.

                        This parameter is required when StorageType is set  to
                        HDD.

                     DataCompressionType -> (string)
                        The  data  compression configuration for the file sys-
                        tem. DataCompressionType can have the  following  val-
                        ues:

                        o NONE  -  Data compression is turned off for the file
                          system.

                        o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 al-
                          gorithm.

                        For more information, see Lustre data compression .

                     LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The   Lustre  logging  configuration.  Lustre  logging
                        writes the enabled log events for your file system  to
                        Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                        Level -> (string)
                            The data repository events that are logged by Ama-
                            zon FSx.

                            o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                            o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                            o WARN_ERROR  -  both  warning  events  and  error
                              events are logged.

                            o DISABLED  - logging of data repository events is
                              turned off.

                            Note that Amazon File Cache uses a default setting
                            of WARN_ERROR , which can't be changed.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the
                            destination of the logs. The  destination  can  be
                            any Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group ARN. The des-
                            tination ARN must be in the same Amazon  Web  Ser-
                            vices  partition,  Amazon Web Services Region, and
                            Amazon Web Services account  as  your  Amazon  FSx
                            file system.

                     RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The Lustre root squash configuration for an Amazon FSx
                        for Lustre file system. When enabled, root squash  re-
                        stricts root-level access from clients that try to ac-
                        cess your file system as a root user.

                        RootSquash -> (string)
                            You enable root squash by setting a user ID  (UID)
                            and group ID (GID) for the file system in the for-
                            mat UID:GID (for example, 365534:65534 ). The  UID
                            and GID values can range from 0 to 4294967294 :

                            o A  non-zero  value  for UID and GID enables root
                              squash. The UID and GID values can be different,
                              but each must be a non-zero value.

                            o A  value  of  0 (zero) for UID and GID indicates
                              root, and therefore disables root squash.

                            When root squash is enabled, the user ID and group
                            ID  of  a  root user accessing the file system are
                            re-mapped to the UID and GID you provide.

                        NoSquashNids -> (list)
                            When root squash is enabled,  you  can  optionally
                            specify an array of NIDs of clients for which root
                            squash does not apply. A client NID  is  a  Lustre
                            Network  Identifier  used  to  uniquely identify a
                            client. You can specify the NID as either a single
                            address or a range of addresses:

                            o A single address is described in standard Lustre
                              NID format by specifying the clients IP  address
                              followed  by the Lustre network ID (for example,
                              10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                            o An address range is described using  a  dash  to
                              separate     the     range     (for     example,
                              10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                            (string)

                 AdministrativeActions -> (list)
                     A list of administrative actions for the file system that
                     are in process or waiting to be processed. Administrative
                     actions describe changes to the Amazon  FSx  system  that
                     you have initiated using the UpdateFileSystem operation.

                     (structure)
                        Describes  a specific Amazon FSx administrative action
                        for the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS file  sys-
                        tem.

                        AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                            Describes  the  type  of administrative action, as
                            follows:

                            o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system update admin-
                              istrative  action  initiated from the Amazon FSx
                              console, API (UpdateFileSystem ),  or  CLI  (up-
                              date-file-system ).

                            o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION - After the FILE_SYSTEM_UP-
                              DATE task to increase a  file  system's  storage
                              capacity  has  been  completed  successfully,  a
                              STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                              o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization is
                                the  process of migrating the file system data
                                to newer larger disks.

                              o For Lustre, storage optimization  consists  of
                                rebalancing  the  data across the existing and
                                newly added file servers.

                            You can track  the  storage-optimization  progress
                            using  the  ProgressPercent  property.  When STOR-
                            AGE_OPTIMIZATION has been completed  successfully,
                            the   parent   FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE   action  status
                            changes to COMPLETED . For more  information,  see

                              olumeFromSnapshot   )   or   CLI   (restore-vol-
                              ume-from-snapshot ).

                            o SNAPSHOT_UPDATE - A snapshot update to an Amazon
                              FSx for OpenZFS volume initiated from the Amazon
                              FSx  console, API (UpdateSnapshot ), or CLI (up-
                              date-snapshot ).

                            o RELEASE_NFS_V3_LOCKS -  Tracks  the  release  of

                               ployment type, there are two  subnet  IDs,  one
                               for  the  preferred file server and one for the
                               standby file server. The preferred file  server
                               subnet   identified  in  the  PreferredSubnetID
                               property. All other file systems have only  one
                               subnet ID.

                               which a specific file system is accessible. The
                               elastic network interface is automatically cre-
                               ated in the same virtual  private  cloud  (VPC)
                               that the Amazon FSx file system was created in.
                               For more information, see Elastic  Network  In-
                               terfaces in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

                                      file system. You can use a DNS alias  to
                                      access  a file system using user-defined
                                      DNS names, in addition  to  the  default
                                      DNS  name that Amazon FSx assigns to the
                                      file system. For more  information,  see

                                      data repository if its Lifecycle is  set
                                      to MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

                                      Message -> (string)
                                          A detailed error message.

                               DeploymentType -> (string)
                                   The  deployment  type of the FSx for Lustre
                                   file system. Scratch deployment type is de-
                                   signed    for    temporary    storage   and
                                   shorter-term processing of data.
                                      SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2 deployment types
                                      are best suited for when you need tempo-
                                      rary storage and shorter-term processing
                                      of  data.  The SCRATCH_2 deployment type
                                      provides in-transit encryption  of  data
                                      and  higher  burst  throughput  capacity
                                      than SCRATCH_1 .

                                   The PERSISTENT_1 and  PERSISTENT_2  deploy-
                                   ment  type  is used for longer-term storage
                                   and workloads and  encryption  of  data  in
                                   transit.  PERSISTENT_2  is  built on Lustre
                                   v2.12 and offers  higher  PerUnitStorageTh-
                                   roughput (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB) along with a
                                   lower minimum storage capacity  requirement
                                   (600 GiB). To learn more about FSx for Lus-
                                   tre deployment types, see  FSx  for  Lustre

                                   The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                               PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                                   Per  unit storage throughput represents the
                                   megabytes  per  second  of  read  or  write
                                   throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage provi-
                                   sioned. File system throughput capacity  is
                                   equal  to Storage capacity (TiB) * PerUnit-
                                   StorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB).  This  option
                                   is  only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSIS-
                                   TENT_2 deployment types.

                                   Valid values:

                                   o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD  storage:  50,  100,
                                     200.

                                   o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                                   o For  PERSISTENT_2  SSD storage: 125, 250,
                                     500, 1000.

                               MountName -> (string)
                                   You use the MountName value  when  mounting
                                   the file system.

                                   For  the  SCRATCH_1  deployment  type, this
                                   value is always "fsx  ".  For  SCRATCH_2  ,
                                   PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 deployment
                                   types, this  value  is  a  string  that  is
                                   unique  within  an  Amazon Web Services Re-
                                   gion.

                               DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                   A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM
                                   .  HH  is  the  zero-padded hour of the day
                                   (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded minute of
                                   the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM
                                   daily.

                               AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                   The number  of  days  to  retain  automatic
                                   backups.  Setting  this  property to 0 dis-
                                   ables automatic backups. You can retain au-
                                   tomatic  backups  for a maximum of 90 days.
                                   The default is 30 .

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A boolean flag indicating whether  tags  on
                                   the  file  system are copied to backups. If
                                   it's set to true, all tags on the file sys-
                                   tem are copied to all automatic backups and
                                   any user-initiated backups where  the  user
                                   doesn't  specify any tags. If this value is
                                   true, and you specify  one  or  more  tags,
                                   only the specified tags are copied to back-
                                   ups. If you specify one or more  tags  when
                                   creating  a  user-initiated backup, no tags
                                   are copied from the file system, regardless
                                   of this value. (Default = false)

                               DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                   The  type  of  drive  cache used by PERSIS-
                                   TENT_1 file systems  that  are  provisioned
                                   with HDD storage devices. This parameter is
                                   required when StorageType is HDD. When  set
                                   to  READ the file system has an SSD storage
                                   cache that is sized to 20% of the file sys-
                                   tem's  storage  capacity. This improves the
                                   performance for frequently  accessed  files
                                   by  caching  up to 20% of the total storage
                                   capacity.

                                   This parameter is required when StorageType
                                   is set to HDD.

                               DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                   The  data compression configuration for the
                                   file system. DataCompressionType  can  have
                                   the following values:

                                   o NONE - Data compression is turned off for
                                     the file system.

                                   o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on  with
                                     the LZ4 algorithm.

                                   For  more information, see Lustre data com-

                                   The Lustre  logging  configuration.  Lustre
                                   logging  writes  the enabled log events for
                                   your file system to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                                   Level -> (string)
                                      The  data  repository  events  that  are
                                      logged by Amazon FSx.

                                      o WARN_ONLY  -  only  warning events are
                                        logged.

                                      o ERROR_ONLY -  only  error  events  are
                                        logged.

                                      o WARN_ERROR  -  both warning events and
                                        error events are logged.

                                      o DISABLED - logging of data  repository
                                        events is turned off.

                                      Note  that  Amazon File Cache uses a de-
                                      fault  setting  of  WARN_ERROR  ,  which
                                      can't be changed.

                                   Destination -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that
                                      specifies the destination of  the  logs.
                                      The destination can be any Amazon Cloud-
                                      Watch Logs log group ARN.  The  destina-

                                      Region,  and Amazon Web Services account
                                      as your Amazon FSx file system.

                               RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The Lustre root squash configuration for an
                                   Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. When en-
                                   abled, root squash restricts root-level ac-
                                   cess  from  clients that try to access your
                                   file system as a root user.

                                   RootSquash -> (string)
                                      You enable root squash by setting a user
                                      ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for the file
                                      system in the format UID:GID (for  exam-
                                      ple,  365534:65534  ).  The  UID and GID
                                      values can range from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                      o A non-zero value for UID and  GID  en-
                                        ables  root  squash.  The  UID and GID
                                        values can be different, but each must
                                        be a non-zero value.

                                      o A  value  of  0 (zero) for UID and GID
                                        indicates root, and therefore disables
                                        root squash.

                                      When root squash is enabled, the user ID
                                      and group ID of a  root  user  accessing
                                      the file system are re-mapped to the UID
                                      and GID you provide.

                                   NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                      When root squash is enabled, you can op-
                                      tionally  specify  an  array  of NIDs of
                                      clients for which root squash  does  not
                                      apply.  A client NID is a Lustre Network
                                      Identifier used to uniquely  identify  a
                                      client.  You  can specify the NID as ei-
                                      ther a single address or a range of  ad-
                                      dresses:

                                        Lustre  network   ID   (for   example,
                                        10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                                      o An  address range is described using a

                                   AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                                      Describes the type of administrative ac-
                                      tion, as follows:

                                      o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system up-
                                        date  administrative  action initiated
                                        from the Amazon FSx console, API  (Up-

                                      o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION   -   After   the
                                        FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  task to increase a
                                        file  system's  storage  capacity  has
                                        been  completed  successfully, a STOR-
                                        AGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                        o For Windows and ONTAP, storage opti-
                                          mization is the process of migrating
                                          the file system data to newer larger
                                          disks.

                                        o For   Lustre,  storage  optimization
                                          consists  of  rebalancing  the  data
                                          across  the existing and newly added
                                          file servers.

                                      You can track  the  storage-optimization
                                      progress using the ProgressPercent prop-
                                      erty. When STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION has been
                                      completed   successfully,   the   parent
                                      FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE action status changes

                                             o CACHE specifies that the volume
                                               is a FlexCache volume.

                                          JunctionPath -> (string)
                                             Specifies the directory that net-

                                             /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                                          SecurityStyle -> (string)
                                             The  security  style for the vol-
                                             ume, which can be UNIX ,  NTFS  ,
                                             or MIXED .

                                          SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                                             The  configured  size of the vol-
                                             ume, in megabytes (MBs).

                                          StorageEfficiencyEnabled  ->  (bool-
                                          ean)
                                             The  volume's  storage efficiency
                                             setting.

                                          StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                             The ID of  the  volume's  storage
                                             virtual machine.

                                          StorageVirtualMachineRoot  -> (bool-
                                          ean)
                                             A Boolean flag indicating whether
                                             this  volume  is  the root volume
                                             for its storage  virtual  machine
                                             (SVM).  Only one volume on an SVM
                                             can  be  the  root  volume.  This
                                             value defaults to false . If this
                                             value is true , then this is  the
                                             SVM root volume.

                                             This  flag  is useful when you're
                                             deleting an SVM, because you must
                                             first  delete  all  non-root vol-
                                             umes.  This  flag,  when  set  to
                                             false  , helps you identify which
                                             volumes to delete before you  can
                                             delete the SVM.

                                                 Specifies the number of  days
                                                 that  user  data  in a volume
                                                 must remain  inactive  before

                                             Specifies  the  type  of  volume.
                                             Valid values are the following:

                                             o RW specifies a read/write  vol-
                                               ume. RW is the default.

                                             o DP  specifies a data-protection
                                               volume. You can protect data by

                                                 TagKey , the name of the tag.
                                                 Tag keys must be  unique  for
                                                 the  resource  to  which they
                                                 are attached.

                                             fault is 128 KiB. Most  workloads
                                             should  use  the  default  record
                                             size. For guidance on when to set

                                               Compared   to  LZ4,  Z-Standard
                                               provides a  better  compression
                                               ratio to minimize on-disk stor-

                                               pression algorithm. Compared to
                                               Z-Standard,  LZ4  is  less com-
                                               pute-intensive   and   delivers
                                               higher write throughput speeds.

                                          CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                             A    Boolean   value   indicating

                                             should  be  copied  to snapshots.
                                             This value defaults to false . If

                                   the  volume  should be copied to snapshots.
                                   This value defaults to false . If it's  set
                                   to  true  ,  all  tags  for  the volume are
                                   copied to snapshots where the user  doesn't
                                   specify tags. If this value is true and you
                                   specify one or more tags, only  the  speci-
                                   fied  tags  are copied to snapshots. If you
                                   specify one or more tags when creating  the
                                   snapshot,  no tags are copied from the vol-
                                   ume, regardless of this value.

                                   ume is the root volume for its storage vir-
                                   tual machine (SVM). Only one volume  on  an
                                   SVM  can be the root volume. This value de-
                                   faults to false . If this value is  true  ,
                                   then this is the SVM root volume.

                                   This flag is useful when you're deleting an
                                   SVM, because  you  must  first  delete  all
                                   non-root  volumes.  This  flag, when set to
                                   false , helps you identify which volumes to
                                   delete before you can delete the SVM.

                               TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                                   The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                                      before it is considered "cold" and moved
                                      to the capacity pool. Used with the AUTO
                                      and  SNAPSHOT_ONLY tiering policies. En-
                                      ter a whole number between  2  and  183.
                                      Default  values are 31 days for AUTO and
                                      2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                        to the capacity pool storage tier.

                                      o AUTO  - moves cold user data and snap-
                                        shots to  the  capacity  pool  storage
                                        tier based on your access patterns.

                                      o ALL  -  moves  all user data blocks in
                                        both the active file system and  Snap-
                                        shot copies to the storage pool tier.

                                      o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in the
                                        primary storage  tier,  preventing  it
                                        from  being moved to the capacity pool
                                        tier.

                                   o RW specifies a read/write volume.  RW  is
                                     the default.

                                   o DP  specifies  a  data-protection volume.
                                     You can protect data by replicating it to
                                     data-protection  mirror copies. If a dis-
                                     aster occurs, you can use these data-pro-

                                     ume. A load-sharing  mirror  reduces  the
                                     network  traffic  to  a FlexVol volume by
                                     providing additional read-only access  to
                                     clients.

                               SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the snapshot policy for the vol-
                                   ume.  There  are  three  built-in  snapshot
                                   policies:

                                   o default  :  This is the default policy. A
                                     maximum of  six  hourly  snapshots  taken
                                     five  minutes past the hour. A maximum of
                                     two daily snapshots taken Monday  through
                                     Saturday  at 10 minutes after midnight. A
                                     maximum of two weekly snapshots taken ev-
                                     ery Sunday at 15 minutes after midnight.

                                   o default-1weekly : This policy is the same
                                     as the default policy except that it only
                                     retains  one  snapshot  from  the  weekly
                                     schedule.

                                   o none : This  policy  does  not  take  any
                                     snapshots. This policy can be assigned to
                                     volumes to  prevent  automatic  snapshots
                                     from being taken.

                                   You  can  also provide the name of a custom
                                   policy that you created with the ONTAP  CLI
                                   or REST API.

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A  boolean flag indicating whether tags for
                                   the volume should  be  copied  to  backups.
                                   This  value  defaults to false. If it's set
                                   to true, all tags for the volume are copied
                                   to all automatic and user-initiated backups
                                   where the user  doesn't  specify  tags.  If
                                   this  value is true, and you specify one or
                                   more tags,  only  the  specified  tags  are
                                   copied  to  backups.  If you specify one or
                                   more tags when  creating  a  user-initiated
                                   backup, no tags are copied from the volume,
                                   regardless of this value.

                               SnaplockConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The SnapLock configuration  object  for  an
                                   FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                                   AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                                      Enables or disables the audit log volume
                                      for an FSx for  ONTAP  SnapLock  volume.
                                      The  default value is false . If you set
                                      AuditLogVolume to true  ,  the  SnapLock
                                      volume  is  created as an audit log vol-
                                      ume. The minimum retention period for an
                                      audit log volume is six months.

                                      The configuration object for setting the
                                      autocommit period of files in an FSx for
                                      ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          Defines the type of time for the au-
                                          tocommit  period of a file in an FSx
                                          for ONTAP SnapLock  volume.  Setting
                                          this value to NONE disables autocom-
                                          mit. The default value is NONE .

                                      Value -> (integer)
                                          Defines the amount of time  for  the

                                          from. For the Amazon FSx Windows and
                                          ONTAP MULTI_AZ_1 file system deploy-
                                          ment type, there are two subnet IDs,
                                          one for the  preferred  file  server
                                          and one for the standby file server.
                                          The  preferred  file  server  subnet

                                          property.  All  other  file  systems
                                          have only one subnet ID.

                                          For FSx for Lustre file systems, and
                                          Single-AZ Windows file systems, this
                                          is  the  ID  of the subnet that con-
                                          tains the  file  system's  endpoint.
                                          For  MULTI_AZ_1  Windows  and  ONTAP
                                          file systems, the file  system  end-
                                          point is available in the Preferred-
                                          SubnetID .

                                          (string)

                                          DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                             The type of drive cache  used  by
                                             PERSISTENT_1  file  systems  that

                                             storage capacity.  This  improves
                                             the  performance  for  frequently

                                             should  be  copied to backups. If
                                             it's set to true ,  all  tags  on
                                             the file system are copied to all
                                             automatic   backups    and    any

                                             user doesn't specify any tags. If
                                             this  value is true and you spec-
                                             ify one or more  tags,  only  the

                                             should be  copied  to  snapshots.
                                             This value defaults to false . If

                                             tags, only the specified tags are
                                             copied to snapshots. If you spec-

                                               is a FlexCache volume.

                                          JunctionPath -> (string)
                                             Specifies the directory that net-

                                          SecurityStyle -> (string)
                                             The  security  style for the vol-
                                             ume, which can be UNIX ,  NTFS  ,
                                             or MIXED .

                                          SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                                             The  configured  size of the vol-
                                             ume, in megabytes (MBs).

                                          StorageEfficiencyEnabled  ->  (bool-
                                          ean)
                                             The  volume's  storage efficiency
                                             setting.

                                          StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                             The ID of  the  volume's  storage
                                             virtual machine.

                                          StorageVirtualMachineRoot  -> (bool-
                                          ean)
                                             A Boolean flag indicating whether
                                             this  volume  is  the root volume
                                             for its storage  virtual  machine
                                             (SVM).  Only one volume on an SVM
                                             can  be  the  root  volume.  This
                                             value defaults to false . If this
                                             value is true , then this is  the
                                             SVM root volume.

                                             This  flag  is useful when you're
                                             deleting an SVM, because you must
                                             first  delete  all  non-root vol-
                                             umes.  This  flag,  when  set  to
                                             false  , helps you identify which
                                             volumes to delete before you  can
                                             delete the SVM.

                                                 Specifies the number of  days
                                                 that  user  data  in a volume
                                                 must remain  inactive  before

                                          OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                             Specifies  the  type  of  volume.
                                             Valid values are the following:

                                             o RW specifies a read/write  vol-
                                               ume. RW is the default.

                                             o DP  specifies a data-protection
                                               volume. You can protect data by
                                               replicating  it to data-protec-
                                               tion mirror copies. If a disas-

                                               to recover data.

                                             o LS   specifies  a  load-sharing
                                               mirror volume.  A  load-sharing

                                             Specifies the snapshot policy for
                                             the   volume.   There  are  three
                                             built-in snapshot policies:

                                             o default : This is  the  default
                                               policy. A maximum of six hourly

                                               past the hour. A maximum of two
                                               daily  snapshots  taken  Monday
                                               through  Saturday at 10 minutes
                                               after midnight.  A  maximum  of

                                               ery Sunday at 15 minutes  after
                                               midnight.

                                             o default-1weekly  :  This policy
                                               is the same as the default pol-

                                               one snapshot  from  the  weekly
                                               schedule.

                                             o none  :  This  policy  does not
                                               take any snapshots. This policy
                                               can  be  assigned to volumes to
                                               prevent   automatic   snapshots
                                               from being taken.

                                             You  can also provide the name of
                                             a custom policy that you  created
                                             with the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                                             can use from its parent. You  can
                                             specify  a  quota larger than the
                                             storage on the parent volume.

                                          RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)

                                             fault is 128 KiB. Most  workloads
                                             should  use  the  default  record
                                             size. For guidance on when to set

                                          DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                             Specifies the method used to com-
                                             press the data on the volume. The
                                             compression  type  is NONE by de-
                                             fault.

                                             o NONE  -  Doesn't  compress  the
                                               data on the volume. NONE is the

                                               the  volume using the Zstandard
                                               (ZSTD)  compression  algorithm.
                                               Compared   to  LZ4,  Z-Standard
                                               provides a  better  compression
                                               ratio to minimize on-disk stor-
                                               age utilization.

                                               pression algorithm. Compared to
                                               Z-Standard,  LZ4  is  less com-
                                               pute-intensive   and   delivers
                                               higher write throughput speeds.

                                          CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                             A    Boolean   value   indicating
                                             whether  tags  for   the   volume
                                             should  be  copied  to snapshots.
                                             This value defaults to false . If
                                             it's  set  to true , all tags for
                                             the volume are  copied  to  snap-
                                             shots   where  the  user  doesn't
                                             specify tags. If  this  value  is
                                             true  and you specify one or more
                                             tags, only the specified tags are
                                             copied to snapshots. If you spec-

                                                 A value  that  specifies  the
                                                 TagValue , the value assigned
                                                 to the corresponding tag key.
                                                 Tag  values  can  be null and
                                                 don't have to be unique in  a
                                                 tag set. For example, you can
                                                 have a key-value  pair  in  a
                                                 tag  set  of finances : April
                                                 and also of payroll : April .

                            OpenZFSConfiguration -> (structure)
                               The configuration of an Amazon FSx for  OpenZFS
                               volume.

                               ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the parent volume.

                               VolumePath -> (string)
                                   The  path  to the volume from the root vol-
                                   ume. For example,  fsx/parentVolume/volume1
                                   .

                               StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                   The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to
                                   reserve from the parent volume.  You  can't
                                   reserve more storage than the parent volume
                                   has reserved.

                               StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                   The maximum amount of storage in  gibibtyes
                                   (GiB) that the volume can use from its par-
                                   ent. You can specify a  quota  larger  than
                                   the storage on the parent volume.

                               RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                   The  record  size  of an OpenZFS volume, in
                                   kibibytes (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8, 16,
                                   32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB. The de-
                                   fault is 128 KiB. Most workloads should use
                                   the  default  record  size. For guidance on
                                   when to set a custom record size,  see  the
                                   Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

                               DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the  method used to compress the
                                   data on the volume. The compression type is
                                   NONE by default.

                                   o NONE  -  Doesn't compress the data on the
                                     volume. NONE is the default.

                                   o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the  volume
                                     using  the  Zstandard  (ZSTD) compression
                                     algorithm. Compared  to  LZ4,  Z-Standard
                                     provides  a  better  compression ratio to
                                     minimize on-disk storage utilization.

                                   o LZ4 - Compresses the data in  the  volume
                                     using the LZ4 compression algorithm. Com-
                                     pared to Z-Standard,  LZ4  is  less  com-
                                     pute-intensive  and delivers higher write
                                     throughput speeds.

                               CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                   A Boolean value indicating whether tags for
                                   the  volume  should be copied to snapshots.
                                   This value defaults to false . If it's  set
                                   to  true  ,  all  tags  for  the volume are
                                   copied to snapshots where the user  doesn't
                                   specify tags. If this value is true and you
                                   specify one or more tags, only  the  speci-
                                   fied  tags  are copied to snapshots. If you
                                   specify one or more tags when creating  the
                                   snapshot,  no tags are copied from the vol-
                                   ume, regardless of this value.

                               OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                   The configuration object that specifies the
                                   snapshot  to  use as the origin of the data
                                   for the volume.

                                   SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a
                                      given  resource.  ARNs uniquely identify
                                      Amazon Web Services  resources.  We  re-
                                      quire  an ARN when you need to specify a
                                      resource  unambiguously  across  all  of
                                      Amazon  Web  Services. For more informa-

                                   CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                      The strategy used when copying data from
                                      the snapshot to the new volume.

                                      o CLONE  - The new volume references the
                                        data in the origin snapshot. Cloning a
                                        snapshot  is  faster  than copying the
                                        data from a snapshot to a  new  volume
                                        and  doesn't  consume disk throughput.
                                        However, the origin snapshot can't  be
                                        deleted if there is a volume using its
                                        copied data.

                                      o FULL_COPY - Copies all data  from  the
                                        snapshot to the new volume.

                               ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                   A Boolean value indicating whether the vol-
                                   ume is read-only.

                               NfsExports -> (list)
                                   The configuration  object  for  mounting  a
                                   Network File System (NFS) file system.

                                   (structure)
                                      The Network File System (NFS) configura-
                                      tions for mounting  an  Amazon  FSx  for
                                      OpenZFS file system.

                                      ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                                          A list of configuration objects that
                                          contain the client and  options  for
                                          mounting the OpenZFS file system.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies  who can mount an Open-
                                             ZFS file system and  the  options
                                             available while mounting the file
                                             system.

                                             Clients -> (string)
                                                 A value  that  specifies  who
                                                 can  mount  the  file system.
                                                 You can  provide  a  wildcard
                                                 character (* ), an IP address
                                                 (0.0.0.0 ), or a CIDR address
                                                 (192.0.2.0/24  ). By default,
                                                 Amazon FSx uses the  wildcard
                                                 character when specifying the
                                                 client.

                                             Options -> (list)
                                                 The  options  to   use   when
                                                 mounting the file system. For
                                                 a list of  options  that  you
                                                 can  use  with  Network  File

                                                 When choosing  your  options,
                                                 consider the following:

                                                 o crossmnt  is  used  by  de-

                                                 o sync is used by default. If
                                                   you instead specify async ,
                                                   the   system   acknowledges
                                                   writes  before  writing  to

                                          that the file system  is  accessible
                                          from. For the Amazon FSx Windows and
                                          ONTAP MULTI_AZ_1 file system deploy-
                                          ment type, there are two subnet IDs,
                                          one for the  preferred  file  server
                                          and one for the standby file server.
                                          The  preferred  file  server  subnet
                                          identified  in the PreferredSubnetID
                                          property.  All  other  file  systems
                                          have only one subnet ID.

                                          For FSx for Lustre file systems, and
                                          Single-AZ Windows file systems, this
                                          is  the  ID  of the subnet that con-
                                          tains the  file  system's  endpoint.
                                          For  MULTI_AZ_1  Windows  and  ONTAP
                                          file systems, the file  system  end-
                                          point is available in the Preferred-
                                          SubnetID .

                                          (string)
                                             The ID for a subnet. A subnet  is
                                             a  range  of IP addresses in your
                                             virtual private cloud (VPC).  For
                                             more  information,  see  VPC  and

                                          terfaces from which a specific  file
                                          system  is  accessible.  The elastic
                                          network interface  is  automatically
                                          created  in the same virtual private
                                          cloud (VPC) that the Amazon FSx file
                                          system  was created in. For more in-
                                          formation, see Elastic  Network  In-

                                             this  volume  is  the root volume
                                             for its storage  virtual  machine
                                             (SVM).  Only one volume on an SVM
                                             can  be  the  root  volume.  This
                                             value defaults to false . If this
                                             value is true , then this is  the
                                             SVM root volume.

                                             This  flag  is useful when you're
                                             deleting an SVM, because you must
                                             first  delete  all  non-root vol-
                                             umes.  This  flag,  when  set  to
                                             false  , helps you identify which
                                             volumes to delete before you  can
                                             delete the SVM.

                                             identifier (UUID).

                                          OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                             Specifies  the  type  of  volume.
                                             Valid values are the following:

                                             o RW specifies a read/write  vol-
                                               ume. RW is the default.

                                             o DP  specifies a data-protection
                                               volume. You can protect data by
                                               replicating  it to data-protec-
                                               tion mirror copies. If a disas-
                                               ter  occurs,  you can use these
                                               data-protection  mirror  copies
                                               to recover data.

                                             o LS   specifies  a  load-sharing
                                               mirror volume.  A  load-sharing
                                               mirror   reduces   the  network
                                               traffic to a FlexVol volume  by
                                               providing  additional read-only
                                               access to clients.

                                          SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                             Specifies the snapshot policy for
                                             the   volume.   There  are  three
                                             built-in snapshot policies:

                                             o default : This is  the  default
                                               policy. A maximum of six hourly
                                               snapshots  taken  five  minutes
                                               past the hour. A maximum of two
                                               daily  snapshots  taken  Monday
                                               through  Saturday at 10 minutes
                                               after midnight.  A  maximum  of
                                               two  weekly snapshots taken ev-
                                               ery Sunday at 15 minutes  after
                                               midnight.

                                             o default-1weekly  :  This policy
                                               is the same as the default pol-

                                               one snapshot  from  the  weekly
                                               schedule.

                                             o none  :  This  policy  does not
                                               take any snapshots. This policy
                                               can  be  assigned to volumes to
                                               prevent   automatic   snapshots
                                               from being taken.

                                             You  can also provide the name of
                                             a custom policy that you  created
                                             with the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                                          CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                             A boolean flag indicating whether
                                             tags for  the  volume  should  be
                                             copied to backups. This value de-
                                             faults to false. If it's  set  to
                                             true, all tags for the volume are

                                             The record  size  of  an  OpenZFS
                                             volume, in kibibytes (KiB). Valid
                                             values are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128,
                                             256,  512,  or  1024 KiB. The de-
                                             fault is 128 KiB. Most  workloads
                                             should  use  the  default  record
                                             size. For guidance on when to set

                                               Compared   to  LZ4,  Z-Standard
                                               provides a  better  compression

                        should be copied to snapshots. This value defaults  to
                        false  . If it's set to true , all tags for the volume
                        are copied to snapshots where the user doesn't specify
                        tags.  If  this  value  is true and you specify one or
                        more tags, only the specified tags are copied to snap-
                        shots.  If  you specify one or more tags when creating
                        the snapshot, no tags are copied from the volume,  re-
                        gardless of this value.

                            with the AUTO and SNAPSHOT_ONLY tiering  policies.
                            Enter  a  whole  number between 2 and 183. Default
                            values are 31 days for AUTO and 2 days  for  SNAP-
                            SHOT_ONLY .

                        Name -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  tiering  policy used to transition
                            data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                            o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold snapshots to the  ca-
                              pacity pool storage tier.

                            o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots to the
                              capacity pool storage tier based on your  access
                              patterns.

                            o ALL - moves all user data blocks in both the ac-
                              tive file system  and  Snapshot  copies  to  the
                              storage pool tier.

                            o NONE  -  keeps  a  volume's  data in the primary
                              storage tier, preventing it from being moved  to
                              the capacity pool tier.

                     UUID -> (string)
                        The volume's universally unique identifier (UUID).

                     OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                        Specifies  the  type  of  volume. Valid values are the
                        following:

                        o RW specifies a read/write volume. RW is the default.

                        o DP specifies a data-protection volume. You can  pro-
                          tect  data by replicating it to data-protection mir-
                          ror copies. If a disaster occurs, you can use  these
                          data-protection mirror copies to recover data.

                        o LS   specifies   a  load-sharing  mirror  volume.  A
                          load-sharing mirror reduces the network traffic to a
                          FlexVol volume by providing additional read-only ac-
                          cess to clients.

                     SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                        Specifies the snapshot policy for  the  volume.  There
                        are three built-in snapshot policies:

                        o default  :  This is the default policy. A maximum of
                          six hourly snapshots taken  five  minutes  past  the
                          hour.  A maximum of two daily snapshots taken Monday
                          through Saturday at 10  minutes  after  midnight.  A
                          maximum  of  two weekly snapshots taken every Sunday
                          at 15 minutes after midnight.

                        o default-1weekly : This policy is the same as the de-
                          fault  policy  except that it only retains one snap-
                          shot from the weekly schedule.

                        o none : This policy does not take any snapshots. This
                          policy  can  be assigned to volumes to prevent auto-
                          matic snapshots from being taken.

                        You can also provide the name of a custom policy  that
                        you created with the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                        For  more  information,  see  Snapshot policies in the
                        Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide .

                     CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                        A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the  volume
                        should  be  copied  to backups. This value defaults to
                        false. If it's set to true, all tags  for  the  volume
                        are copied to all automatic and user-initiated backups
                        where the user doesn't specify tags. If this value  is
                        true, and you specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                        ified tags are copied to backups. If you  specify  one
                        or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no
                        tags are copied from the volume,  regardless  of  this
                        value.

                     SnaplockConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The SnapLock configuration object for an FSx for ONTAP
                        SnapLock volume.

                        AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                            Enables or disables the audit log  volume  for  an
                            FSx  for  ONTAP SnapLock volume. The default value
                            is false . If you set AuditLogVolume to true , the
                            SnapLock volume is created as an audit log volume.
                            The minimum retention period for an audit log vol-
                            ume is six months.

                            For  more information, see SnapLock audit log vol-
                            umes .

                        AutocommitPeriod -> (structure)
                            The configuration object for setting the  autocom-
                            mit  period  of files in an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock
                            volume.

                            Type -> (string)
                               Defines the type of time for the autocommit pe-
                               riod  of  a  file  in an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock
                               volume. Setting this value to NONE disables au-
                               tocommit. The default value is NONE .

                            Value -> (integer)
                               Defines  the  amount of time for the autocommit
                               period of a file in an FSx for  ONTAP  SnapLock
                               volume. The following ranges are valid:

                               o Minutes : 5 - 65,535

                               o Hours : 1 - 65,535

                               o Days : 1 - 3,650

                               o Months : 1 - 120

                               o Years : 1 - 10

                        PrivilegedDelete -> (string)
                            Enables,  disables, or permanently disables privi-
                            leged delete on an FSx for ONTAP  SnapLock  Enter-
                            prise  volume.  Enabling  privileged delete allows
                            SnapLock administrators to delete write once, read
                            many  (WORM) files even if they have active reten-
                            tion periods. PERMANENTLY_DISABLED is  a  terminal
                            state.  If  privileged  delete is permanently dis-
                            abled on a SnapLock volume,  you  can't  re-enable
                            it. The default value is DISABLED .

                            For more information, see Privileged delete .

                        RetentionPeriod -> (structure)
                            Specifies the retention period of an FSx for ONTAP
                            SnapLock volume.

                            DefaultRetention -> (structure)
                               The retention period assigned to a write  once,
                               read many (WORM) file by default if an explicit
                               retention period is not set for an FSx for  ON-
                               TAP  SnapLock volume. The default retention pe-
                               riod must be greater than or equal to the mini-
                               mum  retention period and less than or equal to
                               the maximum retention period.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   Defines the type of time for the  retention
                                   period of an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.
                                   Set it to one of the valid  types.  If  you
                                   set it to INFINITE , the files are retained
                                   forever. If you set it to UNSPECIFIED , the
                                   files  are  retained  until  you set an ex-
                                   plicit retention period.

                               Value -> (integer)
                                   Defines the amount of time for  the  reten-

                            Describes  the  type  of administrative action, as
                            follows:

                            o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system update admin-
                              istrative  action  initiated from the Amazon FSx
                              console, API (UpdateFileSystem ),  or  CLI  (up-
                              date-file-system ).

                            o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION - After the FILE_SYSTEM_UP-
                              DATE task to increase a  file  system's  storage
                              capacity  has  been  completed  successfully,  a
                              STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                              o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization is
                                the  process of migrating the file system data
                                to newer larger disks.

                              o For Lustre, storage optimization  consists  of
                                rebalancing  the  data across the existing and
                                newly added file servers.

                            You can track  the  storage-optimization  progress
                            using  the  ProgressPercent  property.  When STOR-
                            AGE_OPTIMIZATION has been completed  successfully,
                            the   parent   FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE   action  status
                            changes to COMPLETED . For more  information,  see

                               ployment type, there are two  subnet  IDs,  one
                               for  the  preferred file server and one for the
                               standby file server. The preferred file  server
                               subnet   identified  in  the  PreferredSubnetID
                               property. All other file systems have only  one
                               subnet ID.

                               point. For MULTI_AZ_1 Windows  and  ONTAP  file
                               systems,  the file system endpoint is available
                               in the PreferredSubnetID .

                               (string)
                                   The ID for a subnet. A subnet is a range of
                                   IP  addresses in your virtual private cloud

                                   user-initiated  backups  where   the   user
                                   doesn't  specify any tags. If this value is
                                   true, and you specify  one  or  more  tags,
                                   only the specified tags are copied to back-
                                   ups. If you specify one or more  tags  when
                                   creating  a  user-initiated backup, no tags
                                   are copied from the file system, regardless
                                   of this value.

                               Aliases -> (list)
                                   An  array  of  one or more DNS aliases that
                                   are currently associated  with  the  Amazon
                                   FSx  file  system. Aliases allow you to use
                                   existing DNS names to access  the  data  in
                                   your  Amazon FSx file system. You can asso-
                                   ciate up to 50 aliases with a  file  system
                                   at  any  time. You can associate additional
                                   DNS aliases after you create the file  sys-
                                   tem  using  the  AssociateFileSystemAliases
                                   operation. You can remove DNS aliases  from
                                   the  file  system after it is created using
                                   the  DisassociateFileSystemAliases   opera-
                                   tion.  You  only  need to specify the alias
                                   name in the request payload. For  more  in-
                                   formation, see DNS aliases .

                                      file system. You can use a DNS alias  to
                                      access  a file system using user-defined
                                      DNS names, in addition  to  the  default
                                      DNS  name that Amazon FSx assigns to the
                                      file system. For more  information,  see

                                   ExportPath -> (string)
                                      The  export path to the Amazon S3 bucket
                                      (and prefix) that you are using to store
                                      new and changed Lustre file system files
                                      in S3.

                                   ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                                      For files imported from a  data  reposi-
                                      tory,  this  value determines the stripe
                                      count and maximum  amount  of  data  per
                                      file  (in MiB) stored on a single physi-
                                      cal disk. The maximum  number  of  disks
                                      that a single file can be striped across
                                      is limited by the total number of  disks
                                      that make up the file system.

                                      The  default  chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1
                                      GiB) and can go as high as  512,000  MiB
                                      (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a max-
                                      imum size of 5 TB.

                               DeploymentType -> (string)
                                   The  deployment  type of the FSx for Lustre
                                   file system. Scratch deployment type is de-
                                   signed    for    temporary    storage   and
                                   shorter-term processing of data.
                                      SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2 deployment types
                                      are best suited for when you need tempo-
                                      rary storage and shorter-term processing
                                      of  data.  The SCRATCH_2 deployment type
                                      provides in-transit encryption  of  data
                                      and  higher  burst  throughput  capacity
                                      than SCRATCH_1 .

                                   The PERSISTENT_1 and  PERSISTENT_2  deploy-
                                   ment  type  is used for longer-term storage
                                   and workloads and  encryption  of  data  in
                                   transit.  PERSISTENT_2  is  built on Lustre
                                   v2.12 and offers  higher  PerUnitStorageTh-
                                   roughput (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB) along with a
                                   lower minimum storage capacity  requirement
                                   (600 GiB). To learn more about FSx for Lus-
                                   tre deployment types, see  FSx  for  Lustre

                                   The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                               PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                                   Per  unit storage throughput represents the
                                   megabytes  per  second  of  read  or  write
                                   throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage provi-
                                   sioned. File system throughput capacity  is
                                   equal  to Storage capacity (TiB) * PerUnit-
                                   StorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB).  This  option
                                   is  only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSIS-
                                   TENT_2 deployment types.

                                   Valid values:

                                   o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD  storage:  50,  100,
                                     200.

                                   o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                                   o For  PERSISTENT_2  SSD storage: 125, 250,
                                     500, 1000.

                               MountName -> (string)
                                   You use the MountName value  when  mounting
                                   the file system.

                                   For  the  SCRATCH_1  deployment  type, this
                                   value is always "fsx  ".  For  SCRATCH_2  ,
                                   PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 deployment
                                   types, this  value  is  a  string  that  is
                                   unique  within  an  Amazon Web Services Re-
                                   gion.

                               DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                   A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM
                                   .  HH  is  the  zero-padded hour of the day
                                   (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded minute of
                                   the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM
                                   daily.

                               AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                   The number  of  days  to  retain  automatic
                                   backups.  Setting  this  property to 0 dis-
                                   ables automatic backups. You can retain au-
                                   tomatic  backups  for a maximum of 90 days.
                                   The default is 30 .

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A boolean flag indicating whether  tags  on
                                   the  file  system are copied to backups. If
                                   it's set to true, all tags on the file sys-
                                   tem are copied to all automatic backups and
                                   any user-initiated backups where  the  user
                                   doesn't  specify any tags. If this value is
                                   true, and you specify  one  or  more  tags,
                                   only the specified tags are copied to back-
                                   ups. If you specify one or more  tags  when
                                   creating  a  user-initiated backup, no tags
                                   are copied from the file system, regardless
                                   of this value. (Default = false)

                               DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                   The  type  of  drive  cache used by PERSIS-
                                   TENT_1 file systems  that  are  provisioned
                                   with HDD storage devices. This parameter is
                                   required when StorageType is HDD. When  set
                                   to  READ the file system has an SSD storage
                                   cache that is sized to 20% of the file sys-
                                   tem's  storage  capacity. This improves the
                                   performance for frequently  accessed  files
                                   by  caching  up to 20% of the total storage
                                   capacity.

                                   This parameter is required when StorageType
                                   is set to HDD.

                               DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                   The  data compression configuration for the
                                   file system. DataCompressionType  can  have
                                   the following values:

                                   o NONE - Data compression is turned off for
                                     the file system.

                                   o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on  with
                                     the LZ4 algorithm.

                                   For  more information, see Lustre data com-

                                   The Lustre  logging  configuration.  Lustre
                                   logging  writes  the enabled log events for
                                   your file system to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                                   Level -> (string)
                                      The  data  repository  events  that  are
                                      logged by Amazon FSx.

                                      o WARN_ONLY  -  only  warning events are
                                        logged.

                                      o ERROR_ONLY -  only  error  events  are
                                        logged.

                                      o WARN_ERROR  -  both warning events and
                                        error events are logged.

                               RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The Lustre root squash configuration for an
                                   Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. When en-
                                   abled, root squash restricts root-level ac-
                                   cess  from  clients that try to access your
                                   file system as a root user.

                                   RootSquash -> (string)
                                      You enable root squash by setting a user
                                      ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for the file
                                      system in the format UID:GID (for  exam-
                                      ple,  365534:65534  ).  The  UID and GID
                                      values can range from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                      o A non-zero value for UID and  GID  en-
                                        ables  root  squash.  The  UID and GID
                                        values can be different, but each must
                                        be a non-zero value.

                                      o A  value  of  0 (zero) for UID and GID
                                        indicates root, and therefore disables
                                        root squash.

                                      When root squash is enabled, the user ID
                                      and group ID of a  root  user  accessing
                                      the file system are re-mapped to the UID
                                      and GID you provide.

                                   NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                      When root squash is enabled, you can op-
                                      tionally  specify  an  array  of NIDs of
                                      clients for which root squash  does  not
                                      apply.  A client NID is a Lustre Network
                                      Identifier used to uniquely  identify  a
                                      client.  You  can specify the NID as ei-

                                      o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION   -   After   the
                                        FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  task to increase a

                                        o For Windows and ONTAP, storage opti-
                                          mization is the process of migrating
                                          the file system data to newer larger
                                          disks.

                                        o For   Lustre,  storage  optimization
                                          consists  of  rebalancing  the  data
                                          across  the existing and newly added
                                          file servers.

                                          that  the  file system is accessible
                                          from. For the Amazon FSx Windows and
                                          ONTAP MULTI_AZ_1 file system deploy-
                                          ment type, there are two subnet IDs,
                                          one  for  the  preferred file server
                                          and one for the standby file server.
                                          The  preferred  file  server  subnet
                                          identified in the  PreferredSubnetID
                                          property.  All  other  file  systems
                                          have only one subnet ID.

                                          For FSx for Lustre file systems, and
                                          Single-AZ Windows file systems, this
                                          is the ID of the  subnet  that  con-
                                          tains  the  file  system's endpoint.
                                          For  MULTI_AZ_1  Windows  and  ONTAP
                                          file  systems,  the file system end-
                                          point is available in the Preferred-
                                          SubnetID .

                                          (string)
                                             The  ID for a subnet. A subnet is
                                             a range of IP addresses  in  your
                                             virtual  private cloud (VPC). For

                                          system is  accessible.  The  elastic
                                          network  interface  is automatically
                                          created in the same virtual  private
                                          cloud (VPC) that the Amazon FSx file
                                          system was created in. For more  in-

                                             this volume is  the  root  volume
                                             for  its  storage virtual machine
                                             (SVM). Only one volume on an  SVM
                                             can  be  the  root  volume.  This
                                             value defaults to false . If this
                                             value  is true , then this is the
                                             SVM root volume.

                                             This flag is useful  when  you're
                                             deleting an SVM, because you must
                                             first delete  all  non-root  vol-
                                             umes.  This  flag,  when  set  to
                                             false , helps you identify  which
                                             volumes  to delete before you can
                                             delete the SVM.

                                             identifier (UUID).

                                          OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                             Specifies  the  type  of  volume.
                                             Valid values are the following:

                                             o RW  specifies a read/write vol-
                                               ume. RW is the default.

                                             o DP specifies a  data-protection
                                               volume. You can protect data by
                                               replicating it to  data-protec-
                                               tion mirror copies. If a disas-
                                               ter occurs, you can  use  these
                                               data-protection  mirror  copies
                                               to recover data.

                                             o LS  specifies  a   load-sharing
                                               mirror  volume.  A load-sharing
                                               mirror  reduces   the   network
                                               traffic  to a FlexVol volume by
                                               providing additional  read-only
                                               access to clients.

                                          SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                             Specifies the snapshot policy for
                                             the  volume.  There   are   three
                                             built-in snapshot policies:

                                             o default  :  This is the default
                                               policy. A maximum of six hourly
                                               snapshots  taken  five  minutes
                                               past the hour. A maximum of two
                                               daily  snapshots  taken  Monday
                                               through Saturday at 10  minutes
                                               after  midnight.  A  maximum of
                                               two weekly snapshots taken  ev-
                                               ery  Sunday at 15 minutes after
                                               midnight.

                                             o default-1weekly :  This  policy
                                               is the same as the default pol-

                                               one  snapshot  from  the weekly
                                               schedule.

                                             o none :  This  policy  does  not
                                               take any snapshots. This policy
                                               can be assigned to  volumes  to
                                               prevent   automatic   snapshots
                                               from being taken.

                                             You can also provide the name  of
                                             a  custom policy that you created
                                             with the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                                             A boolean flag indicating whether
                                             tags  for  the  volume  should be
                                             copied to backups. This value de-
                                             faults  to  false. If it's set to
                                             true, all tags for the volume are

                                             The  record  size  of  an OpenZFS
                                             volume, in kibibytes (KiB). Valid
                                             values are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128,
                                             256, 512, or 1024  KiB.  The  de-
                                             fault  is 128 KiB. Most workloads
                                             should  use  the  default  record
                                             size. For guidance on when to set

                                               Compared  to  LZ4,   Z-Standard
                                               provides  a  better compression

                                   range in which the endpoints to access your
                                   file system will be created. By default  in
                                   the  Amazon  FSx API, Amazon FSx selects an
                                   unused IP address range for  you  from  the
                                   198.19.*  range.  By  default in the Amazon
                                   FSx console, Amazon FSx chooses the last 64
                                   IP  addresses  from  the  VPCs primary CIDR
                                   range to use as  the  endpoint  IP  address
                                   range  for  the  file  system. You can have

                                   the volume. Valid values are the following:

                                   o NONE  specifies  that  the volume doesn't
                                     have a FlexCache configuration.  NONE  is
                                     the default.

                                   o ORIGIN  specifies  that the volume is the
                                     origin volume for a FlexCache volume.

                                   o CACHE specifies  that  the  volume  is  a
                                     FlexCache volume.

                                   Specifies  the  directory  that network-at-
                                   tached storage (NAS) clients use  to  mount
                                   the  volume, along with the storage virtual
                                   machine (SVM) Domain Name System (DNS) name
                                   or  IP  address. You can create a Junction-
                                   Path directly below a parent  volume  junc-
                                   tion  or  on a directory within a volume. A
                                   JunctionPath for a volume named vol3  might
                                   be  /vol1/vol2/vol3  , or /vol1/dir2/vol3 ,
                                   or even /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                               SecurityStyle -> (string)
                                   The security style for  the  volume,  which
                                   can be UNIX , NTFS , or MIXED .

                               SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                                   The  configured  size  of  the  volume,  in
                                   megabytes (MBs).

                               StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                                   The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                               StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the volume's storage virtual  ma-
                                   chine.

                               StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                   A Boolean flag indicating whether this vol-
                                   ume is the root volume for its storage vir-
                                   tual  machine  (SVM). Only one volume on an
                                   SVM can be the root volume. This value  de-
                                   faults  to  false . If this value is true ,
                                   then this is the SVM root volume.

                                   This flag is useful when you're deleting an
                                   SVM,  because  you  must  first  delete all
                                   non-root volumes. This flag,  when  set  to
                                   false , helps you identify which volumes to
                                   delete before you can delete the SVM.

                               TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                                   The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                                      Specifies the number of days  that  user
                                      data  in  a  volume must remain inactive
                                      before it is considered "cold" and moved
                                      to the capacity pool. Used with the AUTO
                                      and SNAPSHOT_ONLY tiering policies.  En-
                                      ter  a  whole  number between 2 and 183.
                                      Default values are 31 days for AUTO  and
                                      2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  tiering  policy  used to
                                      transition data. Default value is  SNAP-
                                      SHOT_ONLY .

                                      o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snapshots
                                        to the capacity pool storage tier.

                                      o AUTO - moves cold user data and  snap-
                                        shots  to  the  capacity  pool storage
                                        tier based on your access patterns.

                                      o ALL - moves all user  data  blocks  in
                                        both  the active file system and Snap-
                                        shot copies to the storage pool tier.

                                      o NONE - keeps a volume's  data  in  the
                                        primary  storage  tier,  preventing it
                                        from being moved to the capacity  pool
                                        tier.

                               UUID -> (string)
                                   The  volume's universally unique identifier
                                   (UUID).

                               OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                   Specifies the type of volume. Valid  values
                                   are the following:

                                   o RW  specifies  a read/write volume. RW is
                                     the default.

                                   o DP specifies  a  data-protection  volume.
                                     You can protect data by replicating it to
                                     data-protection mirror copies. If a  dis-
                                     aster occurs, you can use these data-pro-
                                     tection mirror copies to recover data.

                                   o LS specifies a load-sharing  mirror  vol-
                                     ume.  A  load-sharing  mirror reduces the
                                     network traffic to a  FlexVol  volume  by
                                     providing  additional read-only access to
                                     clients.

                               SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                   Specifies the snapshot policy for the  vol-
                                   ume.  There  are  three  built-in  snapshot
                                   policies:

                                   o default : This is the default  policy.  A
                                     maximum  of  six  hourly  snapshots taken
                                     five minutes past the hour. A maximum  of
                                     two  daily snapshots taken Monday through
                                     Saturday at 10 minutes after midnight.  A
                                     maximum of two weekly snapshots taken ev-
                                     ery Sunday at 15 minutes after midnight.

                                   o default-1weekly : This policy is the same
                                     as the default policy except that it only
                                     retains  one  snapshot  from  the  weekly
                                     schedule.

                                   o none  :  This  policy  does  not take any
                                     snapshots. This policy can be assigned to
                                     volumes  to  prevent  automatic snapshots
                                     from being taken.

                                   You can also provide the name of  a  custom
                                   policy  that you created with the ONTAP CLI
                                   or REST API.

                                   For more information, see Snapshot policies
                                   in  the  Amazon  FSx  for NetApp ONTAP User
                                   Guide .

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A boolean flag indicating whether tags  for
                                   the  volume  should  be  copied to backups.
                                   This value defaults to false. If  it's  set
                                   to true, all tags for the volume are copied
                                   to all automatic and user-initiated backups
                                   where  the  user  doesn't  specify tags. If
                                   this value is true, and you specify one  or
                                   more  tags,  only  the  specified  tags are
                                   copied to backups. If you  specify  one  or
                                   more  tags  when  creating a user-initiated
                                   backup, no tags are copied from the volume,
                                   regardless of this value.

                               SnaplockConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The  SnapLock  configuration  object for an
                                   FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                                   AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                                      Enables or disables the audit log volume
                                      for  an  FSx  for ONTAP SnapLock volume.
                                      The default value is false . If you  set
                                      AuditLogVolume  to  true  , the SnapLock
                                      volume is created as an audit  log  vol-
                                      ume. The minimum retention period for an
                                      audit log volume is six months.

                                      For more information, see SnapLock audit
                                      log volumes .

                               source. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web  Ser-
                               vices  resources.  We  require  an ARN when you
                               need to specify a resource unambiguously across
                               all  of  Amazon Web Services. For more informa-

                                   fault is 128 KiB. Most workloads should use
                                   the default record size.  For  guidance  on
                                   when  to  set a custom record size, see the
                                   Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

                               DataCompressionType -> (string)

                                   data on the volume. The compression type is
                                   NONE by default.

                                   o NONE - Doesn't compress the data  on  the
                                     volume. NONE is the default.

                                   o ZSTD  - Compresses the data in the volume
                                     using the  Zstandard  (ZSTD)  compression
                                     algorithm.  Compared  to  LZ4, Z-Standard
                                     provides a better  compression  ratio  to
                                     minimize on-disk storage utilization.

                                   o LZ4  -  Compresses the data in the volume
                                     using the LZ4 compression algorithm. Com-

                               CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                   A Boolean value indicating whether tags for
                                   the volume should be copied  to  snapshots.
                                   This  value defaults to false . If it's set
                                   to true ,  all  tags  for  the  volume  are
                                   copied  to snapshots where the user doesn't
                                   specify tags. If this value is true and you
                                   specify  one  or more tags, only the speci-
                                   fied tags are copied to snapshots.  If  you
                                   specify  one or more tags when creating the
                                   snapshot, no tags are copied from the  vol-
                                   ume, regardless of this value.

                               OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                   The configuration object that specifies the
                                   snapshot to use as the origin of  the  data
                                   for the volume.

                                   SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for a
                                      given resource. ARNs  uniquely  identify
                                      Amazon  Web  Services  resources. We re-
                                      quire an ARN when you need to specify  a
                                      resource  unambiguously  across  all  of
                                      Amazon Web Services. For  more  informa-

                                   CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                      The strategy used when copying data from
                                      the snapshot to the new volume.

                                      o CLONE - The new volume references  the
                                        data in the origin snapshot. Cloning a
                                        snapshot is faster  than  copying  the
                                        data  from  a snapshot to a new volume
                                        and doesn't consume  disk  throughput.
                                        However,  the origin snapshot can't be
                                        deleted if there is a volume using its
                                        copied data.

                                      o FULL_COPY  -  Copies all data from the
                                        snapshot to the new volume.

                               ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                   A Boolean value indicating whether the vol-
                                   ume is read-only.

                               NfsExports -> (list)

                                      OpenZFS file system.

                                      ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                                          A list of configuration objects that
                                          contain  the  client and options for

                                                 can mount  the  file  system.
                                                 You  can  provide  a wildcard
                                                 character (* ), an IP address

                                                 (192.0.2.0/24 ). By  default,
                                                 Amazon  FSx uses the wildcard
                                                 character when specifying the
                                                 client.

                                          The type of storage the file  system
                                          is  using.  If set to SSD , the file
                                          system uses solid state drive  stor-
                                          age. If set to HDD , the file system
                                          uses hard disk drive storage.

                                      VpcId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the primary  virtual  pri-
                                          vate  cloud  (VPC) for the file sys-

                                          that  the  file system is accessible
                                          from. For the Amazon FSx Windows and
                                          ONTAP MULTI_AZ_1 file system deploy-
                                          ment type, there are two subnet IDs,
                                          one  for  the  preferred file server
                                          and one for the standby file server.
                                          The  preferred  file  server  subnet
                                          identified in the  PreferredSubnetID
                                          property.  All  other  file  systems
                                          have only one subnet ID.

                                          For FSx for Lustre file systems, and
                                          Single-AZ Windows file systems, this
                                          is the ID of the  subnet  that  con-
                                          tains  the  file  system's endpoint.
                                          For  MULTI_AZ_1  Windows  and  ONTAP
                                          file  systems,  the file system end-
                                          point is available in the Preferred-

                                          system is  accessible.  The  elastic
                                          network  interface  is automatically
                                          created in the same virtual  private
                                          cloud (VPC) that the Amazon FSx file
                                          system was created in. For more  in-

                                          (string)
                                             A  recurring  daily  time, in the
                                             format  HH:MM   .   HH   is   the
                                             zero-padded   hour   of  the  day
                                             (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded
                                             minute  of the hour. For example,
                                             05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                          AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (in-
                                          teger)
                                             The  number of days to retain au-
                                             tomatic  backups.  Setting   this
                                             property  to 0 disables automatic
                                             backups. You can retain automatic
                                             backups for a maximum of 90 days.
                                             The default is 30 .

                                          CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                             A boolean flag indicating whether
                                             tags   on  the  file  system  are
                                             copied to backups. If it's set to
                                             true, all tags on the file system
                                             are copied to all automatic back-
                                             ups  and any user-initiated back-

                                             tags, only the specified tags are
                                             copied to backups. If you specify
                                             one  or more tags when creating a
                                             user-initiated  backup,  no  tags
                                             are  copied from the file system,
                                             regardless of  this  value.  (De-

                                          DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                             The  type  of drive cache used by
                                             PERSISTENT_1  file  systems  that
                                             are  provisioned with HDD storage
                                             devices. This  parameter  is  re-
                                             quired  when  StorageType is HDD.
                                             When set to READ the file  system
                                             has  an SSD storage cache that is
                                             sized to 20% of the file system's
                                             storage  capacity.  This improves
                                             the  performance  for  frequently
                                             accessed  files  by caching up to

                                             ity.

                                             This  parameter  is required when
                                             StorageType is set to HDD.

                                                 You  enable  root  squash  by
                                                 setting  a  user ID (UID) and

                                             ume, in megabytes (MBs).

                                          StorageEfficiencyEnabled  ->  (bool-
                                          ean)
                                             The volume's  storage  efficiency
                                             setting.

                                          StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                             The  ID  of  the volume's storage
                                             virtual machine.

                                          StorageVirtualMachineRoot ->  (bool-
                                          ean)
                                             A Boolean flag indicating whether
                                             this volume is  the  root  volume
                                             for  its  storage virtual machine
                                             (SVM). Only one volume on an  SVM
                                             can  be  the  root  volume.  This
                                             value defaults to false . If this
                                             value  is true , then this is the
                                             SVM root volume.

                                             This flag is useful  when  you're
                                             deleting an SVM, because you must
                                             first delete  all  non-root  vol-
                                             umes.  This  flag,  when  set  to
                                             false , helps you identify  which
                                             volumes  to delete before you can
                                             delete the SVM.

                                          UUID -> (string)
                                             The  volume's  universally unique
                                             identifier (UUID).

                                          OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                             Specifies  the  type  of  volume.
                                             Valid values are the following:

                                             o RW  specifies a read/write vol-
                                               ume. RW is the default.

                                             o DP specifies a  data-protection
                                               volume. You can protect data by
                                               replicating it to  data-protec-
                                               tion mirror copies. If a disas-
                                               ter occurs, you can  use  these
                                               data-protection  mirror  copies
                                               to recover data.

                                             o LS  specifies  a   load-sharing
                                               mirror  volume.  A load-sharing
                                               mirror  reduces   the   network
                                               traffic  to a FlexVol volume by
                                               providing additional  read-only
                                               access to clients.

                                          SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                             Specifies the snapshot policy for
                                             the  volume.  There   are   three
                                             built-in snapshot policies:

                                             o default  :  This is the default
                                               policy. A maximum of six hourly
                                               snapshots  taken  five  minutes
                                               past the hour. A maximum of two
                                               daily  snapshots  taken  Monday

                                               one  snapshot  from  the weekly
                                               schedule.

                                             o none :  This  policy  does  not
                                               take any snapshots. This policy
                                               can be assigned to  volumes  to
                                               prevent   automatic   snapshots
                                               from being taken.

                                             You can also provide the name  of
                                             a  custom policy that you created
                                             with the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                                             Key -> (string)
                                                 A  value  that  specifies the
                                                 TagKey , the name of the tag.
                                                 Tag  keys  must be unique for
                                                 the resource  to  which  they
                                                 are attached.

                        ple, fsx/parentVolume/volume1 .

                     StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                        The amount of storage in gibibytes  (GiB)  to  reserve
                        from the parent volume. You can't reserve more storage
                        than the parent volume has reserved.

                     StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                        The maximum amount of storage in gibibtyes (GiB)  that
                        the  volume can use from its parent. You can specify a

                        512, or 1024 KiB. The default is 128 KiB.  Most  work-
                        loads should use the default record size. For guidance
                        on when to set a custom record size,  see  the  Amazon
                        FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

                     DataCompressionType -> (string)
                        Specifies  the method used to compress the data on the
                        volume. The compression type is NONE by default.

                        o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the volume. NONE
                          is the default.

                        o ZSTD  -  Compresses the data in the volume using the
                          Zstandard (ZSTD) compression algorithm. Compared  to
                          LZ4,  Z-Standard provides a better compression ratio
                          to minimize on-disk storage utilization.

                        o LZ4 - Compresses the data in the  volume  using  the
                          LZ4  compression  algorithm. Compared to Z-Standard,
                          LZ4 is less compute-intensive  and  delivers  higher
                          write throughput speeds.

                     CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                        A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the volume
                        should be copied to snapshots. This value defaults  to
                        false  . If it's set to true , all tags for the volume
                        are copied to snapshots where the user doesn't specify
                        tags.  If  this  value  is true and you specify one or
                        more tags, only the specified tags are copied to snap-
                        shots.  If  you specify one or more tags when creating
                        the snapshot, no tags are copied from the volume,  re-
                        gardless of this value.

                     OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                        The  configuration  object that specifies the snapshot
                        to use as the origin of the data for the volume.

                        SnapshotARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  for  a  given  re-
                            source. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services
                            resources. We require an  ARN  when  you  need  to
                            specify  a  resource  unambiguously  across all of
                            Amazon Web Services.  For  more  information,  see
                            Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs)  in the Amazon Web
                            Services General Reference .

                            shot to the new volume.

                            o CLONE  -  The  new volume references the data in
                              the  origin  snapshot.  Cloning  a  snapshot  is
                              faster  than copying the data from a snapshot to
                              a new volume and doesn't consume  disk  through-
                              put.  However,  the  origin  snapshot  can't  be
                              deleted if there is a volume  using  its  copied
                              data.

                            o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the snapshot to
                              the new volume.

                     ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                        A Boolean  value  indicating  whether  the  volume  is
                        read-only.

                     NfsExports -> (list)

                                   Specifies  who  can  mount  an OpenZFS file
                                   system  and  the  options  available  while
                                   mounting the file system.

                                   Clients -> (string)
                                      A value that specifies who can mount the
                                      file system. You can provide a  wildcard
                                      character  (*  ), an IP address (0.0.0.0
                                      ), or a CIDR address (192.0.2.0/24 ). By
                                      default,  Amazon  FSx  uses the wildcard
                                      character when specifying the client.

                                   Options -> (list)
                                      The options to  use  when  mounting  the
                                      file  system. For a list of options that
                                      you can use  with  Network  File  System
                                      (NFS),  see  the  exports(5) - Linux man
                                      page . When choosing your options,  con-
                                      sider the following:

                                      o crossmnt  is  used  by default. If you
                                        don't specify crossmnt  when  changing
                                        the client configuration, you won't be
                                        able to see  or  access  snapshots  in
                                        your file system's snapshot directory.

                                      o sync  is  used  by default. If you in-
                                        stead specify async , the  system  ac-
                                        knowledges  writes  before  writing to
                                        disk. If the system crashes before the
                                        writes  are finished, you lose the un-
                                        written data.

                               The  amount  of  storage that the user or group
                               can use in gibibytes (GiB).

                     RestoreToSnapshot -> (string)
                        Specifies the ID of the snapshot to which  the  volume
                        was restored.

                     DeleteIntermediateSnaphots -> (boolean)
                        A  Boolean  value indicating whether snapshots between
                        the current state and the specified snapshot should be
                        deleted when a volume is restored from snapshot.

                     DeleteClonedVolumes -> (boolean)
                        A  Boolean  value  indicating  whether dependent clone
                        volumes created from intermediate snapshots should  be

       NextToken -> (string)
          A NextToken value is present if there are more backups than returned
          in the response. You can use the NextToken value in  the  subsequent
          request to fetch the backups.
