CREATE-SNAPSHOT()                                            CREATE-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       create-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  snapshot of an existing Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume. With
       snapshots, you can easily undo file changes and compare  file  versions
       by restoring the volume to a previous version.

       If  a  snapshot with the specified client request token exists, and the
       parameters match, this operation returns the description of the  exist-
       ing snapshot. If a snapshot with the specified client request token ex-
       ists, and the parameters don't match, this operation returns Incompati-
       bleParameterError . If a snapshot with the specified client request to-
       ken doesn't exist, CreateSnapshot does the following:

       o Creates a new OpenZFS snapshot with an assigned ID,  and  an  initial
         lifecycle state of CREATING .

       o Returns the description of the snapshot.

       By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateSnapshot oper-
       ation without the risk of creating an extra snapshot. This approach can
       be  useful  when  an  initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear
       whether a snapshot was created. If you use the same client request  to-
       ken  and  the  initial call created a snapshot, the operation returns a
       successful result because all the parameters are the same.

       The CreateSnapshot operation returns  while  the  snapshot's  lifecycle
       state is still CREATING . You can check the snapshot creation status by
       calling the DescribeSnapshots operation,  which  returns  the  snapshot
       state along with other information.

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional)  An  idempotency token for resource creation, in a string
          of up to 63 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled  on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --name (string)
          The name of the snapshot.

       --volume-id (string)
          The ID of the volume that you are taking a snapshot of.

       --tags (list)
          A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag.  Tag
                 keys  must  be  unique for the resource to which they are at-
                 tached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A value that specifies the TagValue , the value  assigned  to
                 the  corresponding  tag key. Tag values can be null and don't
                 have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can  have  a
                 key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances : April and also of
                 payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     Describes the type of administrative action, as follows:

                     o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system  update  administra-
                       tive  action initiated from the Amazon FSx console, API
                       (UpdateFileSystem ), or CLI (update-file-system ).

                     o THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION - After the  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE
                       task  to  increase  a file system's throughput capacity
                       has been completed successfully, a THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZA-
                       TION  task  starts. You can track the storage-optimiza-
                       tion progress using the ProgressPercent property.  When
                       THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION  has  been  completed  success-
                       fully,  the  parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action  status
                       changes  to  COMPLETED  .  For  more  information,  see

                       dows File Server User Guide .

                     o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  -  After  the  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE
                       task to increase a file system's storage  capacity  has
                       been  completed  successfully,  a  STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION
                       task starts.

                       o For Windows and ONTAP, storage  optimization  is  the
                         process  of  migrating  the file system data to newer
                         larger disks.

                       o For Lustre, storage optimization consists  of  rebal-
                         ancing  the  data across the existing and newly added
                         file servers.

                     You can track the storage-optimization progress using the
                     ProgressPercent  property.  When STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION has
                     been completed successfully, the  parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UP-
                     DATE action status changes to COMPLETED . For more infor-

                     o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_ASSOCIATION - A file system update to
                       associate a new Domain Name System (DNS) alias with the
                       file    system.    For    more     information,     see
                       AssociateFileSystemAliases .

                     o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_DISASSOCIATION - A file system update
                       to disassociate a DNS alias from the file  system.  For
                       more information, see DisassociateFileSystemAliases .

                     o IOPS_OPTIMIZATION  -  After the FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE task
                       to increase a file  system's  throughput  capacity  has
                       been  completed  successfully, a IOPS_OPTIMIZATION task
                       starts. You can track the storage-optimization progress
                       using the ProgressPercent property. When IOPS_OPTIMIZA-
                       TION  has  been  completed  successfully,  the   parent
                       FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE action status changes to COMPLETED .

                       in the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide .

                     o STORAGE_TYPE_OPTIMIZATION  -  After the FILE_SYSTEM_UP-
                       DATE task to increase a file system's throughput capac-
                       ity has been completed successfully, a STORAGE_TYPE_OP-
                       TIMIZATION task starts. You can track the storage-opti-
                       mization  progress  using the ProgressPercent property.
                       When STORAGE_TYPE_OPTIMIZATION has been completed  suc-
                       cessfully,  the parent FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE action status
                       changes to COMPLETED .

                     o VOLUME_UPDATE - A volume update to an  Amazon  FSx  for
                       NetApp ONTAP or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume initiated
                       from the Amazon FSx console, API  (UpdateVolume  ),  or
                       CLI (update-volume ).

                     o VOLUME_RESTORE  -  An  Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume is
                       returned to the state saved by the specified  snapshot,
                       initiated  from  an API (RestoreVolumeFromSnapshot ) or

                 ProgressPercent -> (integer)
                     The percentage-complete status of a  STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION
                     administrative action. Does not apply to any other admin-
                     istrative action type.

                 RequestTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time that the administrative action request  was  re-
                     ceived.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Describes  the  status  of  the administrative action, as
                     follows:

                     o FAILED - Amazon FSx failed to process  the  administra-
                       tive action successfully.

                     o IN_PROGRESS  - Amazon FSx is processing the administra-
                       tive action.

                     o PENDING - Amazon FSx is waiting to process the adminis-
                       trative action.

                     o COMPLETED  - Amazon FSx has finished processing the ad-
                       ministrative task.

                     o UPDATED_OPTIMIZING - For  a  storage-capacity  increase
                       update, Amazon FSx has updated the file system with the
                       new storage capacity, and is now performing  the  stor-
                       age-optimization process.

                            faults  to false. If it's set to true, all tags on
                            the file system are copied to all automatic  back-
                            ups  and any user-initiated backups where the user
                            doesn't specify any tags. If this value  is  true,
                            and  you specify one or more tags, only the speci-
                            fied tags are copied to backups.  If  you  specify
                            one  or  more  tags when creating a user-initiated
                            backup, no tags are copied from the  file  system,
                            regardless of this value.

                            Aliases allow you to use existing DNS names to ac-
                            cess the data in your Amazon FSx file system.  You
                            can  associate up to 50 aliases with a file system
                            at any time.  You  can  associate  additional  DNS
                            aliases after you create the file system using the
                            AssociateFileSystemAliases operation. You can  re-
                            move  DNS aliases from the file system after it is
                            created  using  the  DisassociateFileSystemAliases
                            operation. You only need to specify the alias name
                            in the request payload. For more information,  see
                            DNS aliases .

                            (structure)
                               A  DNS  alias  that is associated with the file
                               system. You can use a DNS  alias  to  access  a
                               file  system  using  user-defined DNS names, in
                               addition to the default DNS  name  that  Amazon
                               FSx assigns to the file system. For more infor-
                               mation, see DNS aliases in the FSx for  Windows
                               File Server User Guide .

                                   The  name  of the DNS alias. The alias name
                                   has to meet the following requirements:

                                   o Formatted  as  a  fully-qualified  domain
                                     name  (FQDN), hostname.domain , for exam-
                                     ple, accounting.example.com .

                                   o Can contain alphanumeric characters,  the
                                     underscore (_), and the hyphen (-).

                                   o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

                                   o Can start with a numeric.

                                   For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic
                                   characters as lowercase letters (a-z),  re-
                                   gardless of how you specify them: as upper-
                                   case letters,  lowercase  letters,  or  the
                                   corresponding letters in escape codes.

                               Lifecycle -> (string)
                                   Describes the state of the DNS alias.

                                   o AVAILABLE  -  The DNS alias is associated
                                     with an Amazon FSx file system.

                                   o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS
                                     alias  and  associating  it with the file
                                     system.

                                   o CREATE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable  to
                                     associate  the  DNS  alias  with the file
                                     system.

                                   o DELETING - Amazon FSx  is  disassociating
                                     the  DNS  alias  from the file system and
                                     deleting it.

                                   o DELETE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable  to
                                     disassociate  the DNS alias from the file
                                     system.

                               durable data repository, if  it  is  configured
                               with  an  S3 repository. The lifecycle can have
                               the following values:

                               o CREATING - The data repository  configuration
                                 between the FSx file system and the linked S3
                                 data repository is being  created.  The  data
                                 repository is unavailable.

                               o AVAILABLE  - The data repository is available
                                 for use.

                               o MISCONFIGURED - Amazon FSx  cannot  automati-
                                 cally import updates from the S3 bucket until
                                 the data  repository  configuration  is  cor-
                                 rected.    For    more    information,    see

                                 bucket .

                               o UPDATING  - The data repository is undergoing
                                 a customer initiated update and  availability
                                 may be impacted.

                               o FAILED - The data repository is in a terminal
                                 state that cannot be recovered.

                            ImportPath -> (string)
                               The import path to the Amazon  S3  bucket  (and
                               optional  prefix) that you're using as the data
                               repository for your FSx for Lustre file system,
                               for  example s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix
                               . If a prefix is specified after the Amazon  S3
                               bucket  name, only object keys with that prefix
                               are loaded into the file system.

                            ExportPath -> (string)
                               The export path to the Amazon  S3  bucket  (and

                               changed Lustre file system files in S3.

                            ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                               For files imported from a data repository, this
                               value  determines  the stripe count and maximum
                               amount of data per file (in MiB)  stored  on  a
                               single  physical  disk.  The  maximum number of
                               disks that a single file can be striped  across
                               is  limited  by  the total number of disks that
                               make up the file system.

                               The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and
                               can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon
                               S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                            AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                               Describes the  file  system's  linked  S3  data
                               repository's AutoImportPolicy . The AutoImport-
                               Policy configures how  Amazon  FSx  keeps  your
                               file  and  directory listings up to date as you
                               add or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket.
                               AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

                               o NONE  -  (Default)  AutoImport is off. Amazon
                                 FSx only updates file and directory  listings
                                 from  the linked S3 bucket when the file sys-
                                 tem is created. FSx does not update file  and
                                 directory listings for any new or changed ob-
                                 jects after choosing this option.

                               o NEW - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx  automati-
                                 cally  imports  directory listings of any new
                                 objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do
                                 not currently exist in the FSx file system.

                               o NEW_CHANGED  -  AutoImport  is on. Amazon FSx
                                 automatically  imports  file  and   directory

                               FIGURED or FAILED .

                               Message -> (string)
                                   A detailed error message.

                        DeploymentType -> (string)
                            The  deployment  type  of  the FSx for Lustre file
                            system. Scratch deployment type  is  designed  for
                            temporary  storage  and shorter-term processing of
                            data.
                               SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2  deployment  types  are
                               best suited for when you need temporary storage
                               and  shorter-term  processing  of   data.   The
                               SCRATCH_2  deployment  type provides in-transit
                               encryption of data and higher burst  throughput
                               capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

                            The  PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment type
                            is used for longer-term storage and workloads  and
                            encryption  of  data  in  transit. PERSISTENT_2 is
                            built on Lustre v2.12 and offers  higher  PerUnit-
                            StorageThroughput (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB) along with
                            a lower minimum storage capacity requirement  (600
                            GiB).  To  learn more about FSx for Lustre deploy-
                            ment types, see FSx for Lustre deployment  options
                            .

                            The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                        PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                            Per   unit   storage   throughput  represents  the
                            megabytes per second of read or  write  throughput
                            per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File system
                            throughput capacity is equal to  Storage  capacity
                            (TiB)  * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). This
                            option is only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and  PERSIS-
                            TENT_2 deployment types.

                            Valid values:

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                            o For  PERSISTENT_2  SSD  storage:  125, 250, 500,
                              1000.

                        MountName -> (string)
                            You use the MountName value when mounting the file
                            system.

                            For  the  SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value is
                            always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 ,  and
                            PERSISTENT_2  deployment  types,  this  value is a
                            string that is unique within an  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                            vices Region.

                        DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                            A  recurring  daily time, in the format HH:MM . HH
                            is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and  MM
                            is  the  zero-padded minute of the hour. For exam-
                            ple, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                        AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                            The number of days to  retain  automatic  backups.
                            Setting  this  property  to  0  disables automatic
                            backups. You can retain automatic  backups  for  a
                            maximum of 90 days. The default is 30 .

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file
                            system are copied to backups. If it's set to true,
                            all  tags on the file system are copied to all au-
                            tomatic backups  and  any  user-initiated  backups
                            where  the  user doesn't specify any tags. If this
                            value is true, and you specify one or  more  tags,
                            only  the specified tags are copied to backups. If
                            you specify one  or  more  tags  when  creating  a
                            user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the
                            file system, regardless of this value. (Default  =
                            false)

                        DriveCacheType -> (string)
                            The  type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file
                            systems that are provisioned with HDD storage  de-
                            vices. This parameter is required when StorageType
                            is HDD. When set to READ the file  system  has  an
                            SSD storage cache that is sized to 20% of the file
                            system's storage capacity. This improves the  per-
                            formance  for frequently accessed files by caching
                            up to 20% of the total storage capacity.

                            This parameter is required when StorageType is set
                            to HDD.

                        DataCompressionType -> (string)
                            The  data  compression  configuration for the file
                            system. DataCompressionType can have the following
                            values:

                            o NONE  -  Data  compression is turned off for the
                              file system.

                            o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4
                              algorithm.

                            For  more information, see Lustre data compression
                            .

                        LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The Lustre logging configuration.  Lustre  logging
                            writes the enabled log events for your file system
                            to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                            Level -> (string)
                               The data repository events that are  logged  by
                               Amazon FSx.

                               o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                               o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                               o WARN_ERROR  -  both  warning events and error
                                 events are logged.

                               o DISABLED - logging of data repository  events
                                 is turned off.

                               Note that Amazon File Cache uses a default set-
                               ting of WARN_ERROR , which can't be changed.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that  specifies
                               the  destination  of  the logs. The destination
                               can be any Amazon  CloudWatch  Logs  log  group
                               ARN.  The  destination  ARN must be in the same
                               Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon Web  Ser-
                               vices  Region,  and Amazon Web Services account
                               as your Amazon FSx file system.

                        RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The Lustre root squash configuration for an Amazon
                            FSx  for  Lustre  file  system. When enabled, root
                            squash restricts root-level  access  from  clients
                            that  try  to  access  your  file system as a root
                            user.

                            RootSquash -> (string)
                               You enable root squash by  setting  a  user  ID
                               (UID) and group ID (GID) for the file system in
                               the format UID:GID (for  example,  365534:65534
                               ).  The  UID and GID values can range from 0 to
                               4294967294 :

                               o A non-zero value for UID and GID enables root
                                 squash. The UID and GID values can be differ-
                                 ent, but each must be a non-zero value.

                               o A value of 0 (zero) for UID and GID indicates
                                 root, and therefore disables root squash.

                               When  root  squash  is enabled, the user ID and
                               group ID of a root user accessing the file sys-
                               tem  are  re-mapped to the UID and GID you pro-
                               vide.

                            NoSquashNids -> (list)
                               When root squash is enabled, you can optionally
                               specify  an  array of NIDs of clients for which
                               root squash does not apply. A client NID  is  a
                               Lustre  Network  Identifier  used  to  uniquely
                               identify a client. You can specify the  NID  as
                               either  a  single  address  or  a  range of ad-
                               dresses:

                               o A single address  is  described  in  standard
                                 Lustre  NID  format by specifying the clients
                                 IP address followed by the Lustre network  ID
                                 (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                               o An address range is described using a dash to
                                 separate    the    range    (for     example,
                                 10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                               (string)

                     AdministrativeActions -> (list)
                        A  list  of administrative actions for the file system
                        that are in process or waiting to be processed. Admin-
                        istrative  actions  describe changes to the Amazon FSx
                        system that  you  have  initiated  using  the  Update-
                        FileSystem operation.

                        (structure)
                            Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative ac-

                            file system.

                            AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                               Describes the type of administrative action, as
                               follows:

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system update ad-
                                 ministrative action initiated from the Amazon
                                 FSx console, API (UpdateFileSystem ), or  CLI
                                 (update-file-system ).

                               o THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION - After the FILE_SYS-
                                 TEM_UPDATE task to increase a  file  system's

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using the ProgressPercent property. When  STOR-

                                   file system deployment type, there are  two
                                   subnet  IDs,  one  for  the  preferred file
                                   server and one for the standby file server.
                                   The preferred file server subnet identified
                                   in  the  PreferredSubnetID  property.   All
                                   other file systems have only one subnet ID.

                                   For  FSx  for Lustre file systems, and Sin-
                                   gle-AZ Windows file systems, this is the ID
                                   of  the  subnet that contains the file sys-
                                   tem's endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1 Windows  and
                                   ONTAP  file  systems,  the file system end-
                                   point is available in the PreferredSubnetID
                                   .

                                   (string)
                                      The ID for a subnet. A subnet is a range

                                   from which a specific file system is acces-
                                   sible. The elastic network interface is au-
                                   tomatically created  in  the  same  virtual
                                   private  cloud  (VPC)  that  the Amazon FSx
                                   file system was created in. For more infor-

                                      backups  and  any user-initiated backups
                                      where the user doesn't specify any tags.

                                   Aliases -> (list)
                                      An array of one or more DNS aliases that
                                      are currently associated with the Amazon
                                      FSx  file  system.  Aliases allow you to
                                      use existing DNS  names  to  access  the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can associate up to 50  aliases  with  a
                                      file  system  at any time. You can asso-
                                      ciate additional DNS aliases  after  you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You  can
                                      remove  DNS aliases from the file system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You only
                                      need to specify the alias  name  in  the
                                      request  payload.  For more information,

                                          alias to access a file system  using
                                          user-defined  DNS names, in addition
                                          to the default DNS name that  Amazon
                                          FSx  assigns to the file system. For

                                      is designed for  temporary  storage  and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1  and  SCRATCH_2 deployment
                                          types are best suited for  when  you
                                          need     temporary    storage    and

                                   MountName -> (string)
                                      You use the MountName value when  mount-
                                      ing the file system.

                                      For  the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this
                                      value is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2  ,
                                      PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 deploy-
                                      ment types, this value is a string  that
                                      is  unique within an Amazon Web Services
                                      Region.

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A recurring daily time,  in  the  format
                                      HH:MM  .  HH  is the zero-padded hour of
                                      the  day   (0-23),   and   MM   is   the
                                      zero-padded  minute of the hour. For ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The number of days to  retain  automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables automatic backups. You can  retain
                                      automatic  backups  for  a maximum of 90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags
                                      on  the  file system are copied to back-
                                      ups. If it's set to true,  all  tags  on
                                      the  file system are copied to all auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups  where  the user doesn't specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are
                                      copied  from the file system, regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The type of drive cache used by  PERSIS-
                                      TENT_1 file systems that are provisioned
                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is  required  when  StorageType  is HDD.
                                      When set to READ the file system has  an
                                      SSD  storage  cache that is sized to 20%
                                      of the file system's  storage  capacity.
                                      This  improves  the performance for fre-
                                      quently accessed files by caching up  to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This  parameter  is  required when Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The data compression  configuration  for
                                      the file system. DataCompressionType can
                                      have the following values:

                                      o NONE - Data compression is turned  off
                                        for the file system.

                                      o LZ4  -  Data  compression is turned on
                                        with the LZ4 algorithm.

                                      For more information,  see  Lustre  data
                                      compression .

                                   LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The Lustre logging configuration. Lustre
                                      logging writes the  enabled  log  events
                                      for  your  file  system to Amazon Cloud-
                                      Watch Logs.

                                      Level -> (string)
                                          The data repository events that  are
                                          logged by Amazon FSx.

                                          o WARN_ONLY  -  only  warning events
                                            are logged.

                                          o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are
                                            logged.

                                          o WARN_ERROR  -  both warning events
                                            and error events are logged.

                                          o DISABLED - logging of data reposi-
                                            tory events is turned off.

                                          Note  that  Amazon File Cache uses a
                                          default  setting  of  WARN_ERROR   ,
                                          which can't be changed.

                                      Destination -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that
                                          specifies  the  destination  of  the
                                          logs.  The  destination  can  be any
                                          Amazon  CloudWatch  Logs  log  group
                                          ARN.  The destination ARN must be in
                                          the same Amazon Web Services  parti-
                                          tion,  Amazon  Web  Services Region,
                                          and Amazon Web Services  account  as
                                          your Amazon FSx file system.

                                   RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The Lustre root squash configuration for
                                      an Amazon FSx for  Lustre  file  system.
                                      When   enabled,  root  squash  restricts
                                      root-level access from clients that  try
                                      to  access  your  file  system as a root
                                      user.

                                      RootSquash -> (string)
                                          You enable root squash by setting  a
                                          user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for
                                          the  file  system  in   the   format
                                          UID:GID  (for  example, 365534:65534
                                          ). The UID and GID values can  range
                                          from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                          o A  non-zero  value for UID and GID
                                            enables root squash. The  UID  and
                                            GID  values  can be different, but
                                            each must be a non-zero value.

                                          o A value of 0 (zero)  for  UID  and
                                            GID  indicates root, and therefore
                                            disables root squash.

                                          When root  squash  is  enabled,  the
                                          user  ID and group ID of a root user
                                          accessing  the   file   system   are
                                          re-mapped  to  the  UID  and GID you
                                          provide.

                                      NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                          When root squash is enabled, you can
                                          optionally  specify an array of NIDs
                                          of clients  for  which  root  squash
                                          does  not  apply.  A client NID is a
                                          Lustre Network  Identifier  used  to
                                          uniquely  identify a client. You can
                                          specify the NID as either  a  single
                                          address or a range of addresses:

                                          o A  single  address is described in
                                            standard  Lustre  NID  format   by
                                            specifying  the clients IP address
                                            followed by the Lustre network  ID
                                            (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                                          o An  address range is described us-
                                            ing a dash to separate  the  range
                                            (for                      example,
                                            10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                               OntapConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The configuration for this Amazon  FSx  for
                                   NetApp ONTAP file system.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of days to retain automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables  automatic backups. You can retain
                                      automatic backups for a  maximum  of  90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A  recurring  daily  time, in the format
                                      HH:MM . HH is the  zero-padded  hour  of
                                      the   day   (0-23),   and   MM   is  the
                                      zero-padded minute of the hour. For  ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   DeploymentType -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the FSx for ONTAP file system
                                      deployment type in use in the file  sys-

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  flag indicating whether this
                                      volume is the root volume for its  stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume on an SVM can be  the  root  volume.
                                      This  value  defaults to false . If this
                                      value is true , then  this  is  the  SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an SVM, because you  must  first  delete
                                      all  non-root  volumes.  This flag, when
                                      set to false , helps you identify  which
                                      volumes  to delete before you can delete
                                      the SVM.

                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold"  and  moved  to  the capacity
                                          pool. Used with the AUTO  and  SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY  tiering policies. Enter a
                                          whole number between 2 and 183.  De-
                                          fault  values  are  31 days for AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          Specifies the tiering policy used to
                                          transition  data.  Default  value is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves  cold  snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage

                                      The  volume's universally unique identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW  specifies  a read/write volume. RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster  occurs,  you  can  use these
                                        data-protection mirror copies  to  re-
                                        cover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume. A load-sharing mirror  reduces
                                        the  network traffic to a FlexVol vol-
                                        ume by providing additional  read-only
                                        access to clients.

                                   SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  snapshot  policy for the
                                      volume. There are three  built-in  snap-
                                      shot policies:

                                      o default  : This is the default policy.
                                        A  maximum  of  six  hourly  snapshots
                                        taken  five  minutes  past the hour. A
                                        maximum of two daily  snapshots  taken
                                        Monday  through Saturday at 10 minutes
                                        after  midnight.  A  maximum  of   two
                                        weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at
                                        15 minutes after midnight.

                                      o default-1weekly : This policy  is  the
                                        same as the default policy except that
                                        it only retains one snapshot from  the
                                        weekly schedule.

                                      o none  :  This policy does not take any
                                        snapshots. This policy can be assigned
                                        to  volumes to prevent automatic snap-
                                        shots from being taken.

                                      You can also provide the name of a  cus-
                                      tom policy that you created with the ON-
                                      TAP CLI or REST API.

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to back-
                                      ups. This value defaults  to  false.  If
                                      it's  set to true, all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are  copied  to  all  automatic  and
                                      user-initiated  backups  where  the user
                                      doesn't specify tags. If this  value  is
                                      true,  and you specify one or more tags,
                                      only the specified tags  are  copied  to
                                      backups. If you specify one or more tags
                                      when creating a  user-initiated  backup,
                                      no  tags are copied from the volume, re-

                                          volume. The default value is false .
                                          If you set AuditLogVolume to true  ,
                                          the SnapLock volume is created as an
                                          audit log volume. The minimum reten-
                                          tion  period for an audit log volume
                                          is six months.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  method  used to compress
                                      the data on the volume. The  compression
                                      type is NONE by default.

                                      o NONE  -  Doesn't  compress the data on
                                        the volume. NONE is the default.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume  using  the  Zstandard (ZSTD) com-
                                        pression algorithm. Compared  to  LZ4,
                                        Z-Standard  provides a better compres-
                                        sion ratio to minimize on-disk storage
                                        utilization.

                                      o LZ4  - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume using the  LZ4  compression  algo-
                                        rithm.  Compared to Z-Standard, LZ4 is
                                        less  compute-intensive  and  delivers
                                        higher write throughput speeds.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean value indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The configuration object that  specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given  resource. ARNs uniquely iden-
                                          tify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                                          We  require  an ARN when you need to
                                          specify  a  resource   unambiguously
                                          across  all  of Amazon Web Services.

                                      CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                          The strategy used when copying  data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE  - The new volume references
                                            the data in the  origin  snapshot.
                                            Cloning  a snapshot is faster than
                                            copying the data from  a  snapshot
                                            to  a  new volume and doesn't con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin  snapshot  can't be deleted
                                            if there is  a  volume  using  its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY  -  Copies all data from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean value indicating  whether  the
                                      volume is read-only.

                                   NfsExports -> (list)
                                      The  configuration object for mounting a
                                      Network File System (NFS) file system.

                                      (structure)

                            fied tags are copied to snapshots. If you  specify
                            one  or  more  tags when creating the snapshot, no
                            tags are copied from  the  volume,  regardless  of

                        WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                            A recurring weekly time, in the format D:HH:MM .
                               D  is  the  day of the week, for which 1 repre-
                               sents Monday and 7 represents Sunday. For  fur-
                               ther  details,  see  the  ISO-8601  spec as de-
                               scribed on Wikipedia .

                               HH is the zero-padded hour of the  day  (0-23),
                               and MM is the zero-padded minute of the hour.

                            For example, 1:05:00 specifies maintenance at 5 AM
                            Monday.

                            pacity.  You  can provision additional IOPS per GB
                            of storage. The configuration consists of the  to-
                            tal  number  of provisioned SSD IOPS and how it is
                            was provisioned, or the mode (by the  customer  or
                            by Amazon FSx).

                            will be created. By default in the Amazon FSx  API
                            and  Amazon  FSx  console,  Amazon  FSx selects an
                            available /28 IP address range for you from one of
                            the  VPC's  CIDR  ranges. You can have overlapping
                            endpoint IP addresses for file systems deployed in
                            the same VPC/route tables.

                     for OpenZFS volume.

                     CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time that the resource  was  created,  in  seconds
                        (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

                     FileSystemId -> (string)
                        The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by
                        Amazon FSx.

                        volume.

                        FlexCacheEndpointType -> (string)
                            Specifies the FlexCache endpoint type of the  vol-
                            ume. Valid values are the following:

                            o NONE  specifies  that  the volume doesn't have a
                              FlexCache configuration. NONE is the default.

                            o ORIGIN specifies that the volume is  the  origin
                              volume for a FlexCache volume.

                            o CACHE  specifies  that the volume is a FlexCache
                              volume.

                        JunctionPath -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  directory  that   network-attached
                            storage  (NAS)  clients  use  to mount the volume,
                            along with the storage virtual machine  (SVM)  Do-
                            main Name System (DNS) name or IP address. You can
                            create a JunctionPath directly below a parent vol-
                            ume  junction or on a directory within a volume. A
                            JunctionPath for a  volume  named  vol3  might  be
                            /vol1/vol2/vol3  ,  or  /vol1/dir2/vol3  , or even
                            /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                        SecurityStyle -> (string)
                            The security style for the volume,  which  can  be
                            UNIX , NTFS , or MIXED .

                        SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                            The  configured  size  of the volume, in megabytes
                            (MBs).

                        StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                            The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                        StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                            The ID of the volume's storage virtual machine.

                        StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean flag indicating whether this  volume  is
                            the  root  volume  for its storage virtual machine
                            (SVM). Only one volume on an SVM can be  the  root
                            volume.  This  value  defaults  to false . If this
                            value is true , then this is the SVM root volume.

                            This flag is useful when you're deleting  an  SVM,
                            because  you  must  first delete all non-root vol-
                            umes. This flag, when set to  false  ,  helps  you
                            identify  which  volumes  to delete before you can
                            delete the SVM.

                        TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                            The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                            CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                               Specifies the number of days that user data  in
                               a volume must remain inactive before it is con-
                               sidered "cold" and moved to the capacity  pool.
                               Used  with  the  AUTO and SNAPSHOT_ONLY tiering
                               policies. Enter a whole number  between  2  and
                               183.  Default values are 31 days for AUTO and 2
                               days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                            Name -> (string)
                               Specifies the tiering policy used to transition
                               data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                               o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snapshots to the
                                 capacity pool storage tier.

                               o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots  to
                                 the  capacity pool storage tier based on your
                                 access patterns.

                               o ALL - moves all user data blocks in both  the
                                 active file system and Snapshot copies to the
                                 storage pool tier.

                               o NONE - keeps a volume's data in  the  primary
                                 storage  tier, preventing it from being moved
                                 to the capacity pool tier.

                        UUID -> (string)
                            The volume's universally unique identifier (UUID).

                        OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                            Specifies the type of volume. Valid values are the
                            following:

                            o RW  specifies a read/write volume. RW is the de-
                              fault.

                            o DP specifies a data-protection volume.  You  can
                              protect  data  by replicating it to data-protec-
                              tion mirror copies. If a  disaster  occurs,  you
                              can  use  these data-protection mirror copies to
                              recover data.

                            o LS specifies a  load-sharing  mirror  volume.  A
                              load-sharing  mirror reduces the network traffic
                              to a  FlexVol  volume  by  providing  additional
                              read-only access to clients.

                        SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  snapshot  policy  for  the volume.
                            There are three built-in snapshot policies:

                            o default : This is the default policy. A  maximum
                              of  six hourly snapshots taken five minutes past
                              the hour. A maximum of two daily snapshots taken
                              Monday through Saturday at 10 minutes after mid-
                              night. A maximum of two weekly  snapshots  taken
                              every Sunday at 15 minutes after midnight.

                            o default-1weekly : This policy is the same as the
                              default policy except that it only  retains  one
                              snapshot from the weekly schedule.

                            o none  : This policy does not take any snapshots.
                              This policy can be assigned to volumes  to  pre-
                              vent automatic snapshots from being taken.

                            You  can  also provide the name of a custom policy
                            that you created with the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                            For more information, see Snapshot policies in the
                            Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide .

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A  boolean  flag  indicating  whether tags for the
                            volume should be copied to backups. This value de-
                            faults to false. If it's set to true, all tags for
                            the  volume  are  copied  to  all  automatic   and
                            user-initiated  backups  where  the  user  doesn't
                            specify tags. If this value is true, and you spec-
                            ify  one or more tags, only the specified tags are
                            copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags
                            when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are
                            copied from the volume, regardless of this value.

                        SnaplockConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The SnapLock configuration object for an  FSx  for
                            ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                            AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                               Enables or disables the audit log volume for an
                               FSx for  ONTAP  SnapLock  volume.  The  default
                               value  is  false . If you set AuditLogVolume to
                               true , the SnapLock volume is created as an au-
                               dit  log  volume.  The minimum retention period
                               for an audit log volume is six months.

                               For more information, see  SnapLock  audit  log
                               volumes .

                               active  retention periods. PERMANENTLY_DISABLED
                               is a terminal state. If  privileged  delete  is
                               permanently  disabled on a SnapLock volume, you
                               can't re-enable it. The default value  is  DIS-
                               ABLED .

                               Describes the type of administrative action, as
                               follows:

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system update ad-
                                 ministrative action initiated from the Amazon
                                 FSx  console, API (UpdateFileSystem ), or CLI
                                 (update-file-system ).

                                 TEM_UPDATE  task  to increase a file system's
                                 throughput capacity has been  completed  suc-
                                 cessfully,   a  THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION  task
                                 starts. You can track  the  storage-optimiza-
                                 tion progress using the ProgressPercent prop-
                                 erty. When THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION  has  been
                                 completed  successfully, the parent FILE_SYS-
                                 TEM_UPDATE action status changes to COMPLETED
                                 . For more information, see Managing through-

                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For Lustre, storage  optimization  consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using  the ProgressPercent property. When STOR-

                                      FSx file system. Aliases  allow  you  to
                                      use  existing  DNS  names  to access the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can  associate  up  to 50 aliases with a
                                      file system at any time. You  can  asso-
                                      ciate  additional  DNS aliases after you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases  operation. You can
                                      remove DNS aliases from the file  system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You only
                                      need  to  specify  the alias name in the
                                      request payload. For  more  information,

                                          the file system. You can use  a  DNS
                                          alias  to access a file system using
                                          user-defined DNS names, in  addition
                                          to  the default DNS name that Amazon
                                          FSx assigns to the file system.  For

                                          SCRATCH_2 deployment  type  provides
                                          in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                          higher  burst  throughput   capacity
                                          than SCRATCH_1 .

                                      The  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2 de-
                                      ployment type is  used  for  longer-term
                                      storage  and workloads and encryption of
                                      data in transit. PERSISTENT_2  is  built
                                      on  Lustre  v2.12  and offers higher Pe-
                                      rUnitStorageThroughput   (up   to   1000
                                      MB/s/TiB)  along  with  a  lower minimum
                                      storage capacity requirement (600  GiB).

                                   PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                                      Per  unit  storage throughput represents
                                      the megabytes  per  second  of  read  or
                                      write throughput per 1 tebibyte of stor-
                                      age provisioned. File system  throughput
                                      capacity  is  equal  to Storage capacity
                                      (TiB)     *     PerUnitStorageThroughput
                                      (MB/s/TiB).  This  option  is only valid
                                      for PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2  de-
                                      ployment types.

                                      Valid values:

                                      o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100,
                                        200.

                                      o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                                      o For  PERSISTENT_2  SSD  storage:  125,
                                        250, 500, 1000.

                                   MountName -> (string)
                                      You  use the MountName value when mount-
                                      ing the file system.

                                      For the SCRATCH_1 deployment type,  this
                                      value  is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 ,
                                      PERSISTENT_1 , and PERSISTENT_2  deploy-
                                      ment  types, this value is a string that
                                      is unique within an Amazon Web  Services
                                      Region.

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A  recurring  daily  time, in the format
                                      HH:MM . HH is the  zero-padded  hour  of
                                      the   day   (0-23),   and   MM   is  the
                                      zero-padded minute of the hour. For  ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of days to retain automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables  automatic backups. You can retain
                                      automatic backups for a  maximum  of  90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags
                                      on the file system are copied  to  back-
                                      ups.  If  it's  set to true, all tags on
                                      the file system are copied to all  auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups where the user  doesn't  specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated   backup,   no  tags  are
                                      copied from the file system,  regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The  type of drive cache used by PERSIS-
                                      TENT_1 file systems that are provisioned
                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is required  when  StorageType  is  HDD.
                                      When  set to READ the file system has an
                                      SSD storage cache that is sized  to  20%
                                      of  the  file system's storage capacity.
                                      This improves the performance  for  fre-
                                      quently  accessed files by caching up to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This parameter is  required  when  Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The  data  compression configuration for
                                      the file system. DataCompressionType can
                                      have the following values:

                                      o NONE  - Data compression is turned off
                                        for the file system.

                                      o LZ4 - Data compression  is  turned  on
                                        with the LZ4 algorithm.

                                      For  more  information,  see Lustre data
                                      compression .

                                   LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The Lustre logging configuration. Lustre
                                      logging  writes  the  enabled log events
                                      for your file system  to  Amazon  Cloud-
                                      Watch Logs.

                                      Level -> (string)
                                          The  data repository events that are
                                          logged by Amazon FSx.

                                          o WARN_ONLY -  only  warning  events
                                            are logged.

                                          o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are
                                            logged.

                                          o WARN_ERROR - both  warning  events
                                            and error events are logged.

                                          o DISABLED - logging of data reposi-
                                            tory events is turned off.

                                          Note that Amazon File Cache  uses  a
                                          default   setting  of  WARN_ERROR  ,
                                          which can't be changed.

                                      Destination -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that
                                          specifies  the  destination  of  the
                                          logs. The  destination  can  be  any
                                          Amazon  CloudWatch  Logs  log  group
                                          ARN. The destination ARN must be  in
                                          the  same Amazon Web Services parti-
                                          tion, Amazon  Web  Services  Region,
                                          and  Amazon  Web Services account as
                                          your Amazon FSx file system.

                                   RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The Lustre root squash configuration for
                                      an  Amazon  FSx  for Lustre file system.
                                      When  enabled,  root  squash   restricts
                                      root-level  access from clients that try
                                      to access your file  system  as  a  root
                                      user.

                                      RootSquash -> (string)
                                          You  enable root squash by setting a
                                          user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for
                                          the   file   system  in  the  format
                                          UID:GID (for  example,  365534:65534
                                          ).  The UID and GID values can range
                                          from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                          o A non-zero value for UID  and  GID
                                            enables  root  squash. The UID and
                                            GID values can be  different,  but
                                            each must be a non-zero value.

                                          o A  value  of  0 (zero) for UID and
                                            GID indicates root, and  therefore
                                            disables root squash.

                                          When  root  squash  is  enabled, the
                                          user ID and group ID of a root  user
                                          accessing   the   file   system  are
                                          re-mapped to the  UID  and  GID  you
                                          provide.

                                      NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                          When root squash is enabled, you can
                                          optionally specify an array of  NIDs
                                          of  clients  for  which  root squash
                                          does not apply. A client  NID  is  a
                                          Lustre  Network  Identifier  used to
                                          uniquely identify a client. You  can
                                          specify  the  NID as either a single
                                          address or a range of addresses:

                                          o A single address is  described  in
                                            standard   Lustre  NID  format  by
                                            specifying the clients IP  address
                                            followed  by the Lustre network ID

                                      A Boolean flag indicating  whether  this
                                      volume  is the root volume for its stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume  on  an  SVM can be the root volume.
                                      This value defaults to false .  If  this
                                      value  is  true  ,  then this is the SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an  SVM,  because  you must first delete
                                      all non-root volumes.  This  flag,  when
                                      set  to false , helps you identify which
                                      volumes to delete before you can  delete
                                      the SVM.

                                          user data in a  volume  must  remain
                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold" and  moved  to  the  capacity

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The volume's universally unique  identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW specifies a read/write  volume.  RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster occurs,  you  can  use  these
                                        data-protection  mirror  copies to re-
                                        cover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume.  A load-sharing mirror reduces
                                        the network traffic to a FlexVol  vol-
                                        ume  by providing additional read-only
                                        access to clients.

                                   SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                      Specifies the snapshot  policy  for  the
                                      volume.  There  are three built-in snap-
                                      shot policies:

                                      o default : This is the default  policy.
                                        A  maximum  of  six  hourly  snapshots
                                        taken five minutes past  the  hour.  A
                                        maximum  of  two daily snapshots taken
                                        Monday through Saturday at 10  minutes
                                        after   midnight.  A  maximum  of  two
                                        weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at
                                        15 minutes after midnight.

                                      o default-1weekly  :  This policy is the
                                        same as the default policy except that
                                        it  only retains one snapshot from the
                                        weekly schedule.

                                      o none : This policy does not  take  any
                                        snapshots. This policy can be assigned
                                        to volumes to prevent automatic  snap-
                                        shots from being taken.

                                      You  can also provide the name of a cus-
                                      tom policy that you created with the ON-
                                      TAP CLI or REST API.

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to back-
                                      ups.  This  value  defaults to false. If
                                      it's set to true, all tags for the  vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to  all  automatic and
                                      user-initiated backups  where  the  user
                                      doesn't  specify  tags. If this value is
                                      true, and you specify one or more  tags,
                                      only  the  specified  tags are copied to
                                      backups. If you specify one or more tags
                                      when  creating  a user-initiated backup,
                                      no tags are copied from the volume,  re-
                                      gardless of this value.

                                      AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                                          Enables or disables  the  audit  log
                                          volume for an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock
                                          volume. The default value is false .
                                          If  you set AuditLogVolume to true ,
                                          the SnapLock volume is created as an
                                          audit log volume. The minimum reten-
                                          tion period for an audit log  volume
                                          is six months.

                                   ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                                      The ID of the parent volume.

                                   VolumePath -> (string)
                                      The path to the  volume  from  the  root
                                      volume.   For   example,  fsx/parentVol-
                                      ume/volume1 .

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to  reserve  from the parent volume. You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The  maximum amount of storage in gibib-
                                      tyes (GiB) that the volume can use  from
                                      its  parent.  You  can  specify  a quota
                                      larger than the storage  on  the  parent
                                      volume.

                                   RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                      The record size of an OpenZFS volume, in
                                      kibibytes (KiB). Valid values are 4,  8,
                                      16,  32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB.
                                      The default is 128 KiB.  Most  workloads
                                      should  use the default record size. For
                                      guidance on when to set a custom  record
                                      size,  see  the  Amazon  FSx for OpenZFS
                                      User Guide .

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the method  used  to  compress
                                      the  data on the volume. The compression
                                      type is NONE by default.

                                      o NONE - Doesn't compress  the  data  on
                                        the volume. NONE is the default.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume using the  Zstandard  (ZSTD)  com-
                                        pression  algorithm.  Compared to LZ4,
                                        Z-Standard provides a better  compres-
                                        sion ratio to minimize on-disk storage
                                        utilization.

                                      o LZ4 - Compresses the data in the  vol-
                                        ume  using  the  LZ4 compression algo-
                                        rithm. Compared to Z-Standard, LZ4  is
                                        less  compute-intensive  and  delivers
                                        higher write throughput speeds.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean value indicating whether  tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are copied to  snapshots  where  the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is true and  you  specify  one  or  more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are copied from the  volume,  regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration object that specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given resource. ARNs uniquely  iden-
                                          tify  Amazon Web Services resources.
                                          We require an ARN when you  need  to
                                          specify   a  resource  unambiguously
                                          across all of Amazon  Web  Services.
                                          For more information, see Amazon Re-
                                          source Names (ARNs)  in  the  Amazon
                                          Web Services General Reference .

                                      CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                          The  strategy used when copying data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE - The new volume  references
                                            the  data  in the origin snapshot.
                                            Cloning a snapshot is faster  than
                                            copying  the  data from a snapshot
                                            to a new volume and  doesn't  con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin snapshot can't  be  deleted
                                            if  there  is  a  volume using its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY - Copies all  data  from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  value indicating whether the
                                      volume is read-only.

                                   NfsExports -> (list)
                                      The configuration object for mounting  a
                                      Network File System (NFS) file system.

                                      (structure)
                                          The  Network  File System (NFS) con-

                                             tions  for  mounting  the OpenZFS
                                             file system.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Specifies who  can  mount  an

                                                 options    available    while
                                                 mounting the file system.

                                                 Clients -> (string)

                                                    ).  By default, Amazon FSx
                                                    uses the wildcard  charac-

                                      source tag.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagKey ,
                                          the name of the tag. Tag  keys  must
                                          be  unique for the resource to which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the  TagValue
                                          ,  the  value assigned to the corre-
                                          sponding tag key. Tag values can  be
                                          null  and don't have to be unique in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a key-value pair in a tag set of fi-
                                          nances : April and also of payroll :
                                          April .

                        VolumePath -> (string)
                            The  path  to the volume from the root volume. For
                            example, fsx/parentVolume/volume1 .

                        StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                            The amount of storage in gibibytes  (GiB)  to  re-
                            serve  from  the  parent volume. You can't reserve
                            more storage than the parent volume has reserved.

                        StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)

                            that  the  volume can use from its parent. You can
                            specify a quota larger than  the  storage  on  the
                            parent volume.

                        RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                            The record size of an OpenZFS volume, in kibibytes
                            (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8,  16,  32,  64,  128,
                            256,  512,  or  1024  KiB. The default is 128 KiB.
                            Most workloads should use the default record size.
                            For  guidance on when to set a custom record size,
                            see the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

                        DataCompressionType -> (string)
                            Specifies the method used to compress the data  on
                            the  volume.  The  compression type is NONE by de-
                            fault.

                            o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the  volume.
                              NONE is the default.

                            o ZSTD  -  Compresses the data in the volume using
                              the Zstandard (ZSTD) compression algorithm. Com-
                              pared  to LZ4, Z-Standard provides a better com-
                              pression ratio to minimize on-disk storage  uti-
                              lization.

                            o LZ4  -  Compresses  the data in the volume using
                              the  LZ4  compression  algorithm.  Compared   to
                              Z-Standard,  LZ4  is  less compute-intensive and
                              delivers higher write throughput speeds.

                        CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value indicating whether  tags  for  the
                            volume  should  be copied to snapshots. This value
                            defaults to false . If it's set to true , all tags
                            for  the  volume are copied to snapshots where the
                            user doesn't specify tags. If this value  is  true
                            and  you specify one or more tags, only the speci-
                            fied tags are copied to snapshots. If you  specify
                            one  or  more  tags when creating the snapshot, no
                            tags are copied from  the  volume,  regardless  of
                            this value.

                        OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                            The  configuration object that specifies the snap-
                            shot to use as the origin of the data for the vol-
                            ume.

                            SnapshotARN -> (string)
                               The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given re-
                               source. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web  Ser-
                               vices  resources.  We  require  an ARN when you
                               need to specify a resource unambiguously across
                               all  of  Amazon Web Services. For more informa-
                               tion, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  in  the
                               Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                            CopyStrategy -> (string)
                               The  strategy  used  when copying data from the
                               snapshot to the new volume.

                               o CLONE - The new volume references the data in
                                 the  origin  snapshot.  Cloning a snapshot is
                                 faster than copying the data from a  snapshot
                                 to  a  new  volume  and  doesn't consume disk
                                 throughput.  However,  the  origin   snapshot
                                 can't  be  deleted if there is a volume using
                                 its copied data.

                               o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the snapshot
                                 to the new volume.

                        ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  value indicating whether the volume is
                            read-only.

                        NfsExports -> (list)

                            File System (NFS) file system.

                            (structure)
                               The  Network  File  System (NFS) configurations
                               for mounting an Amazon  FSx  for  OpenZFS  file
                               system.

                                   tain the client and  options  for  mounting
                                   the OpenZFS file system.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  who can mount an OpenZFS file
                                      system and the options  available  while
                                      mounting the file system.

                                      Clients -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies who can mount
                                          the file system. You can  provide  a
                                          wildcard  character  (* ), an IP ad-
                                          dress (0.0.0.0 ), or a CIDR  address
                                          (192.0.2.0/24  ). By default, Amazon
                                          FSx uses the wildcard character when
                                          specifying the client.

                                      Options -> (list)
                                          The options to use when mounting the
                                          file system. For a list  of  options
                                          that  you  can use with Network File
                                          System (NFS), see the  exports(5)  -
                                          Linux  man page . When choosing your
                                          options, consider the following:

                                            you  don't  specify  crossmnt when
                                            changing the client configuration,
                                            you won't be able to see or access
                                            snapshots in  your  file  system's
                                            snapshot directory.

                                          o sync  is  used  by default. If you
                                            instead specify async , the system
                                            acknowledges writes before writing
                                            to disk. If the system crashes be-
                                            fore  the writes are finished, you
                                            lose the unwritten data.

                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For Lustre, storage  optimization  consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using  the ProgressPercent property. When STOR-

                                   of the subnet that contains the  file  sys-
                                   tem's  endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1 Windows and
                                   ONTAP file systems, the  file  system  end-
                                   point is available in the PreferredSubnetID
                                   .

                                      For  MULTI_AZ_1  deployment  types,  use
                                      this  endpoint  when performing adminis-
                                      trative tasks on the file  system  using
                                      Amazon FSx Remote PowerShell.

                                      For  SINGLE_AZ_1 and SINGLE_AZ_2 deploy-
                                      ment types, this is the DNS name of  the
                                      file system.

                                      This endpoint is temporarily unavailable
                                      when the file system is undergoing main-
                                      tenance.

                                   PreferredSubnetId -> (string)
                                      For   MULTI_AZ_1  deployment  types,  it
                                      specifies the ID of the subnet where the
                                      preferred  file  server is located. Must
                                      be one of the two subnet  IDs  specified
                                      in SubnetIds property. Amazon FSx serves
                                      traffic from this subnet except  in  the

                                      For SINGLE_AZ_1 and SINGLE_AZ_2  deploy-
                                      ment  types,  this  value is the same as
                                      that for SubnetIDs . For  more  informa-

                                      backups.  This  value defaults to false.
                                      If it's set to true,  all  tags  on  the
                                      file  system are copied to all automatic
                                      backups and any  user-initiated  backups
                                      where the user doesn't specify any tags.
                                      If this value is true, and  you  specify
                                      one  or  more  tags,  only the specified
                                      tags are copied to backups. If you spec-
                                      ify  one  or  more  tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are
                                      copied  from the file system, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   Aliases -> (list)
                                      An array of one or more DNS aliases that

                                      FSx file system. Aliases  allow  you  to
                                      use  existing  DNS  names  to access the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can  associate  up  to 50 aliases with a
                                      file system at any time. You  can  asso-
                                      ciate  additional  DNS aliases after you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases  operation. You can
                                      remove DNS aliases from the file  system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You only
                                      need  to  specify  the alias name in the
                                      request payload. For  more  information,

                                          the file system. You can use  a  DNS
                                          alias  to access a file system using
                                          user-defined DNS names, in  addition
                                          to  the default DNS name that Amazon
                                          FSx assigns to the file system.  For

                                      ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                                          For  files  imported  from  a   data
                                          repository,  this  value  determines
                                          the stripe count and maximum  amount
                                          of  data per file (in MiB) stored on
                                          a single physical disk. The  maximum
                                          number  of  disks that a single file
                                          can be striped across is limited  by
                                          the  total number of disks that make
                                          up the file system.

                                          The default chunk size is 1,024  MiB
                                          (1  GiB)  and  can  go  as  high  as
                                          512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 ob-

                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is  designed  for  temporary storage and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1 and  SCRATCH_2  deployment
                                          types  are  best suited for when you
                                          need    temporary    storage     and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2 deployment  type  provides
                                          in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                          higher  burst  throughput   capacity
                                          than SCRATCH_1 .

                                      ployment type is  used  for  longer-term
                                      storage  and workloads and encryption of
                                      data in transit. PERSISTENT_2  is  built
                                      on  Lustre  v2.12  and offers higher Pe-
                                      rUnitStorageThroughput   (up   to   1000
                                      MB/s/TiB)  along  with  a  lower minimum
                                      storage capacity requirement (600  GiB).

                                      ing the file system.

                                      For the SCRATCH_1 deployment type,  this
                                      value  is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 ,
                                      PERSISTENT_1 , and PERSISTENT_2  deploy-
                                      ment  types, this value is a string that
                                      is unique within an Amazon Web  Services
                                      Region.

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A  recurring  daily  time, in the format
                                      HH:MM . HH is the  zero-padded  hour  of
                                      the   day   (0-23),   and   MM   is  the
                                      zero-padded minute of the hour. For  ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of days to retain automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables  automatic backups. You can retain
                                      automatic backups for a  maximum  of  90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags
                                      on the file system are copied  to  back-
                                      ups.  If  it's  set to true, all tags on
                                      the file system are copied to all  auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups where the user  doesn't  specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated   backup,   no  tags  are
                                      copied from the file system,  regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The  type of drive cache used by PERSIS-
                                      TENT_1 file systems that are provisioned
                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is required  when  StorageType  is  HDD.
                                      When  set to READ the file system has an
                                      SSD storage cache that is sized  to  20%
                                      of  the  file system's storage capacity.
                                      This improves the performance  for  fre-
                                      quently  accessed files by caching up to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This parameter is  required  when  Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The  data  compression configuration for
                                      the file system. DataCompressionType can
                                      have the following values:

                                      o NONE  - Data compression is turned off
                                        for the file system.

                                      o LZ4 - Data compression  is  turned  on
                                        with the LZ4 algorithm.

                                   RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The Lustre root squash configuration for
                                      an  Amazon  FSx  for Lustre file system.
                                      When  enabled,  root  squash   restricts
                                      root-level  access from clients that try
                                      to access your file  system  as  a  root
                                      user.

                                      RootSquash -> (string)
                                          You  enable root squash by setting a
                                          user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for
                                          the   file   system  in  the  format
                                          UID:GID (for  example,  365534:65534
                                          ).  The UID and GID values can range
                                          from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                          o A non-zero value for UID  and  GID
                                            enables  root  squash. The UID and
                                            GID values can be  different,  but
                                            each must be a non-zero value.

                                          o A  value  of  0 (zero) for UID and
                                            GID indicates root, and  therefore
                                            disables root squash.

                                          When  root  squash  is  enabled, the
                                          user ID and group ID of a root  user
                                          accessing   the   file   system  are
                                          re-mapped to the  UID  and  GID  you
                                          provide.

                                      NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                          When root squash is enabled, you can
                                          optionally specify an array of  NIDs
                                          of  clients  for  which  root squash
                                          does not apply. A client  NID  is  a
                                          Lustre  Network  Identifier  used to
                                          uniquely identify a client. You  can
                                          specify  the  NID as either a single
                                          address or a range of addresses:

                                          o A single address is  described  in
                                            standard   Lustre  NID  format  by
                                            specifying the clients IP  address
                                            followed  by the Lustre network ID
                                            (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                                          o An address range is described  us-
                                            ing  a  dash to separate the range
                                            (for                      example,
                                            10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                                      ables automatic backups. You can  retain
                                      automatic  backups  for  a maximum of 90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   The  configuration of an Amazon FSx for Ne-
                                   tApp ONTAP volume.

                                   FlexCacheEndpointType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the FlexCache endpoint type of
                                      the volume. Valid values are the follow-
                                      ing:

                                      o NONE specifies that the volume doesn't
                                        have  a  FlexCache configuration. NONE
                                        is the default.

                                      o ORIGIN specifies that  the  volume  is
                                        the origin volume for a FlexCache vol-
                                        ume.

                                      o CACHE specifies that the volume  is  a
                                        FlexCache volume.

                                   JunctionPath -> (string)
                                      Specifies the directory that network-at-
                                      tached  storage  (NAS)  clients  use  to
                                      mount the volume, along with the storage
                                      virtual machine (SVM) Domain Name System
                                      (DNS) name or IP address. You can create
                                      a JunctionPath directly below  a  parent
                                      volume junction or on a directory within
                                      a volume. A JunctionPath  for  a  volume
                                      named vol3 might be /vol1/vol2/vol3 , or
                                      /vol1/dir2/vol3      ,      or      even
                                      /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                                   SecurityStyle -> (string)
                                      The security style for the volume, which
                                      can be UNIX , NTFS , or MIXED .

                                   SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                                      The configured size of  the  volume,  in
                                      megabytes (MBs).

                                   StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                                      The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                      The  ID  of the volume's storage virtual
                                      machine.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean flag indicating  whether  this
                                      volume  is the root volume for its stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume  on  an  SVM can be the root volume.
                                      This value defaults to false .  If  this
                                      value  is  true  ,  then this is the SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an  SVM,  because  you must first delete
                                      all non-root volumes.  This  flag,  when
                                      set  to false , helps you identify which
                                      volumes to delete before you can  delete
                                      the SVM.

                                   TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                                      The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                                      CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                                          Specifies  the  number  of days that
                                          user data in a  volume  must  remain
                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold" and  moved  to  the  capacity
                                          pool.  Used  with the AUTO and SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY tiering policies. Enter  a
                                          whole  number between 2 and 183. De-
                                          fault values are 31  days  for  AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          Specifies the tiering policy used to
                                          transition data.  Default  value  is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage
                                            tier.

                                          o AUTO  -  moves  cold user data and
                                            snapshots  to  the  capacity  pool
                                            storage  tier based on your access
                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL - moves all user  data  blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage
                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing it from being moved to the ca-
                                            pacity pool tier.

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The volume's universally unique  identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW specifies a read/write  volume.  RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster occurs,  you  can  use  these
                                        data-protection  mirror  copies to re-
                                        cover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume.  A load-sharing mirror reduces
                                        the network traffic to a FlexVol  vol-
                                        ume  by providing additional read-only
                                        access to clients.

                                   SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                      Specifies the snapshot  policy  for  the
                                      volume.  There  are three built-in snap-
                                      shot policies:

                                      o default : This is the default  policy.
                                        A  maximum  of  six  hourly  snapshots
                                        taken five minutes past  the  hour.  A
                                        maximum  of  two daily snapshots taken
                                        Monday through Saturday at 10  minutes
                                        after   midnight.  A  maximum  of  two
                                        weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at
                                        15 minutes after midnight.

                                      o default-1weekly  :  This policy is the
                                        same as the default policy except that
                                        it  only retains one snapshot from the
                                        weekly schedule.

                                      o none : This policy does not  take  any
                                        snapshots. This policy can be assigned
                                        to volumes to prevent automatic  snap-
                                        shots from being taken.

                                      You  can also provide the name of a cus-
                                      tom policy that you created with the ON-
                                      TAP CLI or REST API.

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to back-
                                      ups.  This  value  defaults to false. If
                                      it's set to true, all tags for the  vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to  all  automatic and
                                      user-initiated backups  where  the  user
                                      doesn't  specify  tags. If this value is
                                      true, and you specify one or more  tags,
                                      only  the  specified  tags are copied to
                                      backups. If you specify one or more tags
                                      when  creating  a user-initiated backup,
                                      no tags are copied from the volume,  re-
                                      gardless of this value.

                                      AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                                          Enables or disables  the  audit  log
                                          volume for an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock
                                          volume. The default value is false .
                                          If  you set AuditLogVolume to true ,
                                          the SnapLock volume is created as an

                                          A  value that specifies the TagKey ,
                                          the name of the tag. Tag  keys  must
                                          be  unique for the resource to which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the  TagValue

                                          sponding tag key. Tag values can  be
                                          null  and don't have to be unique in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a key-value pair in a tag set of fi-

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to  reserve  from the parent volume. You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The  maximum amount of storage in gibib-
                                      tyes (GiB) that the volume can use  from
                                      its  parent.  You  can  specify  a quota
                                      larger than the storage  on  the  parent
                                      volume.

                                   RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                      The record size of an OpenZFS volume, in
                                      kibibytes (KiB). Valid values are 4,  8,
                                      16,  32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB.
                                      The default is 128 KiB.  Most  workloads
                                      should  use the default record size. For
                                      guidance on when to set a custom  record
                                      size,  see  the  Amazon  FSx for OpenZFS

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the method  used  to  compress
                                      the  data on the volume. The compression
                                      type is NONE by default.

                                      o NONE - Doesn't compress  the  data  on
                                        the volume. NONE is the default.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume using the  Zstandard  (ZSTD)  com-
                                        pression  algorithm.  Compared to LZ4,
                                        Z-Standard provides a better  compres-
                                        sion ratio to minimize on-disk storage
                                        utilization.

                                      o LZ4 - Compresses the data in the  vol-
                                        ume  using  the  LZ4 compression algo-
                                        rithm. Compared to Z-Standard, LZ4  is
                                        less  compute-intensive  and  delivers
                                        higher write throughput speeds.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean value indicating whether  tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are copied to  snapshots  where  the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is true and  you  specify  one  or  more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are copied from the  volume,  regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration object that specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given resource. ARNs uniquely  iden-
                                          tify  Amazon Web Services resources.
                                          We require an ARN when you  need  to
                                          specify   a  resource  unambiguously
                                          across all of Amazon  Web  Services.
                                          For more information, see Amazon Re-
                                          source Names (ARNs)  in  the  Amazon

                                      CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                          The  strategy used when copying data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE - The new volume  references
                                            the  data  in the origin snapshot.
                                            Cloning a snapshot is faster  than
                                            copying  the  data from a snapshot
                                            to a new volume and  doesn't  con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin snapshot can't  be  deleted
                                            if  there  is  a  volume using its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY - Copies all  data  from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  value indicating whether the
                                      volume is read-only.

                                   NfsExports -> (list)
                                      The configuration object for mounting  a
