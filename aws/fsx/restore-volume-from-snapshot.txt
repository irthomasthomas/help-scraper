OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in  a  string
          of  up to 63 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --volume-id (string)
          The ID of the volume that you are restoring.

       --snapshot-id (string)
          The  ID  of the source snapshot. Specifies the snapshot that you are
          restoring from.

       --options (list)
          The settings used when restoring the specified volume from snapshot.

          o DELETE_INTERMEDIATE_SNAPSHOTS - Deletes snapshots between the cur-
            rent  state  and the specified snapshot. If there are intermediate
            snapshots and this option  isn't  used,  RestoreVolumeFromSnapshot
            fails.

          o DELETE_CLONED_VOLUMES  -  Deletes any dependent clone volumes cre-
            ated from intermediate snapshots. If there are any dependent clone
            volumes  and  this  option  isn't  used, RestoreVolumeFromSnapshot
            fails.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            DELETE_INTERMEDIATE_SNAPSHOTS
            DELETE_CLONED_VOLUMES

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

OUTPUT
       VolumeId -> (string)
          The ID of the volume that you restored.

       Lifecycle -> (string)
          The lifecycle state of the volume being restored.

       AdministrativeActions -> (list)
          A  list  of  administrative  actions for the file system that are in
          process or waiting to be processed. Administrative actions  describe
          changes to the Amazon FSx system.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  specific  Amazon FSx administrative action for the
              current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS file system.

              AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                 Describes the type of administrative action, as follows:

                 o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file  system  update  administrative
                   action  initiated from the Amazon FSx console, API (Update-
                   FileSystem ), or CLI (update-file-system ).

                 o THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION - After the FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE task
                   to  increase  a  file system's throughput capacity has been
                   completed  successfully,  a  THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION   task
                   starts. You can track the storage-optimization progress us-
                   ing the ProgressPercent property. When THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZA-
                   TION  has been completed successfully, the parent FILE_SYS-
                   TEM_UPDATE action status changes to COMPLETED  .  For  more
                   information, see Managing throughput capacity in the Amazon
                   FSx for Windows File Server User Guide .

                 o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION - After the FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE task to
                   increase  a  file  system's  storage capacity has been com-
                   pleted successfully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                   o For  Windows  and  ONTAP,  storage  optimization  is  the
                     process of migrating the file system data to newer larger
                     disks.

                   o For Lustre, storage optimization consists of  rebalancing
                     the  data  across  the  existing  and  newly  added  file
                     servers.

                 You can track the  storage-optimization  progress  using  the
                 ProgressPercent  property. When STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION has been
                 completed successfully, the parent FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action
                 status  changes  to  COMPLETED  .  For  more information, see
                 Managing storage capacity in the Amazon FSx for Windows  File
                 Server  User Guide , Managing storage and throughput capacity

                 age  capacity  and provisioned IOPS in the Amazon FSx for Ne-
                 tApp ONTAP User Guide .

                 o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_ASSOCIATION - A file system update to as-
                   sociate  a new Domain Name System (DNS) alias with the file
                   system.       For       more        information,        see
                   AssociateFileSystemAliases .

                 o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_DISASSOCIATION  - A file system update to
                   disassociate a DNS alias from the file system. For more in-
                   formation, see DisassociateFileSystemAliases .

                 o IOPS_OPTIMIZATION  -  After  the FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE task to
                   increase a file system's throughput capacity has been  com-
                   pleted  successfully,  a IOPS_OPTIMIZATION task starts. You
                   can track the storage-optimization progress using the  Pro-
                   gressPercent property. When IOPS_OPTIMIZATION has been com-
                   pleted successfully, the parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action
                   status  changes  to  COMPLETED  . For more information, see
                   Managing provisioned SSD IOPS in the Amazon FSx for Windows
                   File Server User Guide .

                 o STORAGE_TYPE_OPTIMIZATION  -  After  the FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE
                   task to increase a file system's  throughput  capacity  has
                   been  completed  successfully,  a STORAGE_TYPE_OPTIMIZATION
                   task  starts.  You  can  track   the   storage-optimization
                   progress  using  the  ProgressPercent  property. When STOR-
                   AGE_TYPE_OPTIMIZATION has been completed successfully,  the
                   parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action  status  changes to COM-
                   PLETED .

                 o VOLUME_UPDATE - A volume update to an Amazon FSx for NetApp
                   ONTAP  or  Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume initiated from the
                   Amazon FSx  console,  API  (UpdateVolume  ),  or  CLI  (up-
                   date-volume ).

                 o VOLUME_RESTORE  -  An  Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume is re-
                   turned to the state saved by the specified snapshot, initi-
                   ated  from  an API (RestoreVolumeFromSnapshot ) or CLI (re-
                   store-volume-from-snapshot ).

                 o SNAPSHOT_UPDATE - A snapshot update to an  Amazon  FSx  for
                   OpenZFS  volume  initiated from the Amazon FSx console, API
                   (UpdateSnapshot ), or CLI (update-snapshot ).

                 o RELEASE_NFS_V3_LOCKS - Tracks the release of  Network  File
                   System  (NFS)  V3  locks  on an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file
                   system.

              ProgressPercent -> (integer)
                 The percentage-complete status of a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  ad-
                 ministrative  action. Does not apply to any other administra-
                 tive action type.

              RequestTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the administrative action request was received.

              Status -> (string)
                 Describes the status of the administrative  action,  as  fol-
                 lows:

                 o FAILED  -  Amazon  FSx failed to process the administrative
                   action successfully.

                 o IN_PROGRESS - Amazon FSx is processing  the  administrative
                   action.

                 o PENDING  - Amazon FSx is waiting to process the administra-
                   tive action.

                 o COMPLETED - Amazon FSx has finished processing the adminis-
                   trative task.

                 o UPDATED_OPTIMIZING  -  For  a storage-capacity increase up-
                   date, Amazon FSx has updated the file system with  the  new
                   storage  capacity,  and is now performing the storage-opti-
                   mization process.

              TargetFileSystemValues -> (structure)

                     The Amazon Web Services account  that  created  the  file
                     system.  If  the file system was created by a user in IAM
                     Identity Center, the Amazon Web Services account to which
                     the IAM user belongs is the owner.

                 CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  time  that  the  file system was created, in seconds
                     (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

                 FileSystemId -> (string)
                     The system-generated, unique 17-digit ID of the file sys-
                     tem.

                 FileSystemType -> (string)
                     The type of Amazon FSx file system, which can be LUSTRE ,

                 Lifecycle -> (string)
                     The lifecycle status of the file  system.  The  following
                     are the possible values and what they mean:

                     o AVAILABLE  - The file system is in a healthy state, and
                       is reachable and available for use.

                     o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the new file system.

                     o DELETING - Amazon FSx is deleting an existing file sys-
                       tem.

                     o FAILED - An existing file system has experienced an un-
                       recoverable failure. When creating a new  file  system,
                       Amazon FSx was unable to create the file system.

                     o MISCONFIGURED  - The file system is in a failed but re-
                       coverable state.

                       File Server only) The file system is currently unavail-
                       able due to a change in your Active Directory  configu-
                       ration.

                     o UPDATING  -  The  file  system  is  undergoing  a  cus-
                       tomer-initiated update.

                 FailureDetails -> (structure)
                     A structure providing details of any  failures  that  oc-
                     curred.

                     Message -> (string)
                        A message describing any failures that occurred.

                 StorageCapacity -> (integer)
                     The  storage  capacity  of  the  file system in gibibytes
                     (GiB).

                 StorageType -> (string)
                     The type of storage the file system is using. If  set  to
                     SSD  , the file system uses solid state drive storage. If
                     set to HDD , the file system uses hard disk  drive  stor-
                     age.

                 VpcId -> (string)
                     The ID of the primary virtual private cloud (VPC) for the
                     file system.

                 SubnetIds -> (list)
                     Specifies the IDs of the subnets that the file system  is
                     accessible  from.  For  the  Amazon FSx Windows and ONTAP
                     MULTI_AZ_1 file system deployment  type,  there  are  two
                     subnet IDs, one for the preferred file server and one for
                     the standby file server. The preferred file server subnet
                     identified  in  the PreferredSubnetID property. All other
                     file systems have only one subnet ID.

                     For FSx for Lustre file systems,  and  Single-AZ  Windows
                     file  systems, this is the ID of the subnet that contains
                     the file system's endpoint. For  MULTI_AZ_1  Windows  and
                     ONTAP file systems, the file system endpoint is available
                     in the PreferredSubnetID .

                     (string)
                        The ID for a subnet. A subnet is a  range  of  IP  ad-
                        dresses  in your virtual private cloud (VPC). For more
                        information, see VPC and subnets  in  the  Amazon  VPC
                        User Guide.

                 NetworkInterfaceIds -> (list)
                     The  IDs  of  the elastic network interfaces from which a
                     specific file system is accessible. The  elastic  network
                     interface  is  automatically  created in the same virtual
                     private cloud (VPC) that the Amazon FSx file  system  was
                     created in. For more information, see Elastic Network In-
                     terfaces in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

                     For an Amazon FSx for Windows File  Server  file  system,
                     you  can have one network interface ID. For an Amazon FSx
                     for Lustre file system, you can have more than one.

                     (string)
                        An elastic network interface ID.  An  elastic  network
                        interface  is a logical networking component in a vir-
                        tual private cloud (VPC)  that  represents  a  virtual
                        network  card.  For more information, see Elastic Net-
                        work Interfaces in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux
                        Instances .

                 DNSName -> (string)
                     The Domain Name System (DNS) name for the file system.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     The  ID  of  the Key Management Service (KMS) key used to
                     encrypt Amazon FSx file system data. Used as follows with

                        specify any tags. If this value is true, and you spec-
                        ify one or more tags,  only  the  specified  tags  are
                        copied  to  backups.  If  you specify one or more tags
                        when creating a user-initiated  backup,  no  tags  are
                        copied from the file system, regardless of this value.

                        in your Amazon FSx file system. You can  associate  up
                        to  50 aliases with a file system at any time. You can
                        associate additional DNS aliases after you create  the
                        file system using the AssociateFileSystemAliases oper-
                        ation. You can remove DNS aliases from the file system
                        after  it  is  created  using the DisassociateFileSys-
                        temAliases operation. You only  need  to  specify  the
                        alias  name  in the request payload. For more informa-

                            sis Data Firehose delivery stream ARN.

                            The  name  of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group
                            must begin with the /aws/fsx prefix. The  name  of
                            the  Amazon  Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream
                            must begin with the aws-fsx prefix.

                            The destination ARN (either  CloudWatch  Logs  log
                            group  or  Kinesis  Data Firehose delivery stream)
                            must be in the same Amazon Web Services partition,
                            Amazon  Web  Services  Region, and Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices account as your Amazon FSx file system.

                     DiskIopsConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The SSD IOPS (input/output operations per second) con-
                        figuration  for an Amazon FSx for Windows file system.
                        By default, Amazon FSx automatically provisions 3 IOPS
                        per  GiB  of storage capacity. You can provision addi-
                        tional IOPS per GiB of  storage,  up  to  the  maximum
                        limit associated with your chosen throughput capacity.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            Specifies whether the file system is using the AU-
                            TOMATIC setting of SSD IOPS of 3 IOPS  per  GB  of
                            storage  capacity,  , or if it using a USER_PROVI-
                            SIONED value.

                        Iops -> (long)
                            The total number of SSD IOPS provisioned  for  the
                            file system.

                 LustreConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The configuration for the Amazon FSx for Lustre file sys-
                     tem.

                     WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                        The preferred start time  to  perform  weekly  mainte-
                        nance, formatted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone. Here, d
                        is the weekday number, from  1  through  7,  beginning
                        with Monday and ending with Sunday.

                     DataRepositoryConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  data  repository  configuration object for Lustre
                        file systems returned in the response of  the  Create-
                        FileSystem operation.

                        This data type is not supported on file systems with a
                        data repository association. For file systems  with  a
                        data repository association, see .

                        Lifecycle -> (string)
                            Describes  the  state  of  the  file  system's  S3
                            durable data repository, if it is configured  with
                            an  S3 repository. The lifecycle can have the fol-
                            lowing values:

                            o CREATING - The data repository configuration be-
                              tween the FSx file system and the linked S3 data
                              repository is being created. The data repository
                              is unavailable.

                            o AVAILABLE - The data repository is available for
                              use.

                            o MISCONFIGURED - Amazon FSx cannot  automatically
                              import updates from the S3 bucket until the data
                              repository configuration is corrected. For  more
                              information, see Troubleshooting a Misconfigured
                              linked S3 bucket .

                            o UPDATING - The data repository is  undergoing  a
                              customer  initiated  update and availability may
                              be impacted.

                            o FAILED - The data repository is  in  a  terminal
                              state that cannot be recovered.

                        ImportPath -> (string)
                            The  import  path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and op-
                            tional prefix)  that  you're  using  as  the  data
                            repository  for  your  FSx for Lustre file system,
                            for example  s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix  .
                            If  a  prefix  is  specified  after  the Amazon S3
                            bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are
                            loaded into the file system.

                        ExportPath -> (string)
                            The  export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and pre-
                            fix) that you are using to store new  and  changed
                            Lustre file system files in S3.

                        ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                            For  files  imported  from a data repository, this
                            value determines  the  stripe  count  and  maximum
                            amount  of data per file (in MiB) stored on a sin-
                            gle physical disk. The  maximum  number  of  disks
                            that  a  single file can be striped across is lim-
                            ited by the total number of disks that make up the
                            file system.

                            The  default  chunk  size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and
                            can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3
                            objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                        AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                            Describes the file system's linked S3 data reposi-
                            tory's  AutoImportPolicy  .  The  AutoImportPolicy
                            configures  how Amazon FSx keeps your file and di-
                            rectory listings up to date as you add  or  modify
                            objects in your linked S3 bucket. AutoImportPolicy
                            can have the following values:

                            o NONE - (Default) AutoImport is off.  Amazon  FSx
                              only  updates  file  and directory listings from
                              the linked S3 bucket when  the  file  system  is
                              created.  FSx does not update file and directory
                              listings for any new or  changed  objects  after
                              choosing this option.

                            o NEW - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically
                              imports directory listings of  any  new  objects
                              added  to  the linked S3 bucket that do not cur-
                              rently exist in the FSx file system.

                            o NEW_CHANGED - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx auto-
                              matically imports file and directory listings of
                              any new objects added to the S3 bucket  and  any
                              existing  objects  that  are  changed  in the S3
                              bucket after you choose this option.

                            o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED - AutoImport is  on.  Amazon
                              FSx  automatically  imports  file  and directory
                              listings of any new  objects  added  to  the  S3
                              bucket, any existing objects that are changed in
                              the S3 bucket, and any objects that were deleted
                              in the S3 bucket.

                        FailureDetails -> (structure)
                            Provides   detailed  information  about  the  data
                            repository if its Lifecycle is set  to  MISCONFIG-
                            URED or FAILED .

                            Message -> (string)
                               A detailed error message.

                     DeploymentType -> (string)
                        The deployment type of the FSx for Lustre file system.
                        Scratch deployment  type  is  designed  for  temporary
                        storage and shorter-term processing of data.
                            SCRATCH_1  and SCRATCH_2 deployment types are best
                            suited for when you  need  temporary  storage  and
                            shorter-term processing of data. The SCRATCH_2 de-
                            ployment type provides  in-transit  encryption  of
                            data  and  higher  burst  throughput capacity than
                            SCRATCH_1 .

                        The PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment  type  is
                        used for longer-term storage and workloads and encryp-
                        tion of data in transit.  PERSISTENT_2  offers  higher
                        PerUnitStorageThroughput  (up  to 1000 MB/s/TiB) along
                        with a lower minimum storage capacity requirement (600
                        GiB).  To  learn  more about FSx for Lustre deployment
                        types, see FSx for Lustre deployment options .

                        The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                     PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                        Per unit storage throughput represents  the  megabytes
                        per  second of read or write throughput per 1 tebibyte
                        of storage provisioned. File system throughput  capac-
                        ity  is equal to Storage capacity (TiB) * PerUnitStor-
                        ageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). This option  is  only  valid
                        for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment types.

                        Valid values:

                        o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                        o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                        o For PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage: 125, 250, 500, 1000.

                     MountName -> (string)
                        You  use  the  MountName  value when mounting the file
                        system.

                        For the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value  is  al-
                        ways  "fsx  ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 , and PER-
                        SISTENT_2 deployment types, this  value  is  a  string
                        that is unique within an Amazon Web Services Region.

                     DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                        A  recurring  daily  time, in the format HH:MM . HH is
                        the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM is  the
                        zero-padded  minute  of  the  hour. For example, 05:00
                        specifies 5 AM daily.

                     AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                        The number of days to retain automatic  backups.  Set-
                        ting  this  property  to 0 disables automatic backups.
                        You can retain automatic backups for a maximum  of  90
                        days. The default is 30 .

                     CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                        A  boolean  flag  indicating  whether tags on the file
                        system are copied to backups. If it's set to true, all
                        tags  on  the  file system are copied to all automatic
                        backups and any user-initiated backups where the  user
                        doesn't  specify  any tags. If this value is true, and
                        you specify one or more tags, only the specified  tags
                        are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags
                        when creating a user-initiated  backup,  no  tags  are
                        copied from the file system, regardless of this value.
                        (Default = false)

                     DriveCacheType -> (string)
                        The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file sys-
                        tems  that  are  provisioned with HDD storage devices.
                        This parameter is required when  StorageType  is  HDD.
                        When  set  to  READ the file system has an SSD storage
                        cache that is sized to 20% of the file system's  stor-
                        age  capacity.  This improves the performance for fre-
                        quently accessed files by caching up to 20% of the to-
                        tal storage capacity.

                        This  parameter is required when StorageType is set to
                        HDD.

                     DataCompressionType -> (string)
                        The data compression configuration for the  file  sys-
                        tem.  DataCompressionType  can have the following val-
                        ues:

                        o NONE - Data compression is turned off for  the  file
                          system.

                        o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 al-
                          gorithm.

                        For more information, see Lustre data compression .

                     LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  Lustre  logging  configuration.  Lustre   logging
                        writes  the enabled log events for your file system to
                        Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                        Level -> (string)
                            The data repository events that are logged by Ama-
                            zon FSx.

                            o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                            o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                            o WARN_ERROR  -  both  warning  events  and  error
                              events are logged.

                            o DISABLED - logging of data repository events  is
                              turned off.

                            Note that Amazon File Cache uses a default setting
                            of WARN_ERROR , which can't be changed.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies  the
                            destination  of  the  logs. The destination can be
                            any Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group ARN. The des-
                            tination  ARN  must be in the same Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices partition, Amazon Web Services  Region,  and
                            Amazon  Web  Services  account  as your Amazon FSx
                            file system.

                     RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The Lustre root squash configuration for an Amazon FSx
                        for  Lustre file system. When enabled, root squash re-
                        stricts root-level access from clients that try to ac-
                        cess your file system as a root user.

                        RootSquash -> (string)
                            You  enable root squash by setting a user ID (UID)
                            and group ID (GID) for the file system in the for-
                            mat  UID:GID (for example, 365534:65534 ). The UID
                            and GID values can range from 0 to 4294967294 :

                            o A non-zero value for UID and  GID  enables  root
                              squash. The UID and GID values can be different,
                              but each must be a non-zero value.

                            o A value of 0 (zero) for UID  and  GID  indicates
                              root, and therefore disables root squash.

                            When root squash is enabled, the user ID and group
                            ID of a root user accessing the  file  system  are
                            re-mapped to the UID and GID you provide.

                        NoSquashNids -> (list)
                            When  root  squash  is enabled, you can optionally
                            specify an array of NIDs of clients for which root
                            squash  does  not  apply. A client NID is a Lustre
                            Network Identifier used  to  uniquely  identify  a
                            client. You can specify the NID as either a single
                            address or a range of addresses:

                            o A single address is described in standard Lustre
                              NID  format by specifying the clients IP address
                              followed by the Lustre network ID (for  example,
                              10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                            o An  address  range  is described using a dash to
                              separate     the     range     (for     example,
                              10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                            (string)

                 AdministrativeActions -> (list)
                     A list of administrative actions for the file system that
                     are in process or waiting to be processed. Administrative
                     actions  describe  changes  to the Amazon FSx system that
                     you have initiated using the UpdateFileSystem operation.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative  action
                        for  the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS file sys-
                        tem.

                        AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                            Describes the type of  administrative  action,  as
                            follows:

                            o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system update admin-
                              istrative action initiated from the  Amazon  FSx
                              console,  API  (UpdateFileSystem  ), or CLI (up-
                              date-file-system ).

                            o THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION -  After  the  FILE_SYS-
                              TEM_UPDATE  task  to  increase  a  file system's
                              throughput capacity has been completed  success-
                              fully,  a  THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION  task starts.
                              You can track the storage-optimization  progress
                              using   the   ProgressPercent   property.   When
                              THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION has been completed  suc-
                              cessfully,  the parent FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE action
                              status changes to COMPLETED . For more  informa-

                              Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide .

                            o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION - After the FILE_SYSTEM_UP-
                              DATE  task  to  increase a file system's storage
                              capacity  has  been  completed  successfully,  a
                              STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                              o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization is
                                the process of migrating the file system  data
                                to newer larger disks.

                              o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists of
                                rebalancing the data across the  existing  and
                                newly added file servers.

                            You  can  track  the storage-optimization progress
                            using the  ProgressPercent  property.  When  STOR-
                            AGE_OPTIMIZATION  has been completed successfully,
                            the  parent   FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE   action   status
                            changes  to  COMPLETED . For more information, see

                                   the  file  system should be copied to back-
                                   ups. This value defaults to false. If  it's
                                   set  to  true,  all tags on the file system
                                   are copied to all automatic backups and any
                                   user-initiated   backups   where  the  user
                                   doesn't specify any tags. If this value  is
                                   true,  and  you  specify  one or more tags,
                                   only the specified tags are copied to back-
                                   ups.  If  you specify one or more tags when
                                   creating a user-initiated backup,  no  tags
                                   are copied from the file system, regardless
                                   of this value.

                               Aliases -> (list)
                                   An array of one or more  DNS  aliases  that
                                   are  currently  associated  with the Amazon
                                   FSx file system. Aliases allow you  to  use
                                   existing  DNS  names  to access the data in
                                   your Amazon FSx file system. You can  asso-
                                   ciate  up  to 50 aliases with a file system
                                   at any time. You can  associate  additional
                                   DNS  aliases after you create the file sys-
                                   tem  using  the  AssociateFileSystemAliases
                                   operation.  You can remove DNS aliases from
                                   the file system after it is  created  using
                                   the   DisassociateFileSystemAliases  opera-
                                   tion. You only need to  specify  the  alias
                                   name  in  the request payload. For more in-

                                      file  system. You can use a DNS alias to
                                      access a file system using  user-defined
                                      DNS  names,  in  addition to the default
                                      DNS name that Amazon FSx assigns to  the
                                      file  system.  For more information, see

                                   Lifecycle -> (string)
                                      Describes the state of the file system's
                                      S3 durable data  repository,  if  it  is
                                      configured  with  an  S3 repository. The
                                      lifecycle can have the following values:

                                      o CREATING - The data repository config-
                                        uration  between  the  FSx file system
                                        and the linked S3 data  repository  is
                                        being  created. The data repository is
                                        unavailable.

                                      o AVAILABLE -  The  data  repository  is
                                        available for use.

                                      o MISCONFIGURED  - Amazon FSx cannot au-
                                        tomatically import updates from the S3
                                        bucket  until the data repository con-
                                        figuration is corrected. For more  in-
                                        formation,  see Troubleshooting a Mis-
                                        configured linked S3 bucket .

                                      o UPDATING - The data repository is  un-
                                        dergoing  a  customer initiated update
                                        and availability may be impacted.

                                      o FAILED - The data repository is  in  a
                                        terminal  state  that cannot be recov-
                                        ered.

                                   ImportPath -> (string)
                                      The import path to the Amazon S3  bucket
                                      (and  optional prefix) that you're using
                                      as the data repository for your FSx  for
                                      Lustre file system, for example s3://im-
                                      port-bucket/optional-prefix . If a  pre-
                                      fix  is  specified  after  the Amazon S3
                                      bucket name, only object keys with  that
                                      prefix are loaded into the file system.

                                   ExportPath -> (string)
                                      The  export path to the Amazon S3 bucket
                                      (and prefix) that you are using to store
                                      new and changed Lustre file system files
                                      in S3.

                                   ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                                      For files imported from a  data  reposi-
                                      tory,  this  value determines the stripe
                                      count and maximum  amount  of  data  per
                                      file  (in MiB) stored on a single physi-
                                      cal disk. The maximum  number  of  disks
                                      that a single file can be striped across
                                      is limited by the total number of  disks
                                      that make up the file system.

                                      The  default  chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1
                                      GiB) and can go as high as  512,000  MiB
                                      (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a max-
                                      imum size of 5 TB.

                                   AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                                      Describes the file  system's  linked  S3
                                      data repository's AutoImportPolicy . The
                                      AutoImportPolicy configures  how  Amazon
                                      FSx  keeps your file and directory list-
                                      ings up to date as you add or modify ob-
                                      jects  in your linked S3 bucket. AutoIm-
                                      portPolicy can have the  following  val-
                                      ues:

                                      o NONE  -  (Default)  AutoImport is off.
                                        Amazon FSx only updates file  and  di-
                                        rectory  listings  from  the linked S3
                                        bucket when the file  system  is  cre-
                                        ated. FSx does not update file and di-
                                        rectory  listings  for  any   new   or
                                        changed  objects  after  choosing this
                                        option.

                                      o NEW - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx au-
                                        tomatically imports directory listings
                                        of any new objects added to the linked
                                        S3  bucket that do not currently exist
                                        in the FSx file system.

                                      o NEW_CHANGED - AutoImport is on. Amazon
                                        FSx automatically imports file and di-
                                        rectory listings of  any  new  objects
                                        added  to the S3 bucket and any exist-
                                        ing objects that are changed in the S3
                                        bucket after you choose this option.

                                      o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED  -  AutoImport  is
                                        on. Amazon FSx  automatically  imports
                                        file and directory listings of any new
                                        objects added to the  S3  bucket,  any
                                        existing  objects  that are changed in
                                        the S3 bucket, and  any  objects  that
                                        were deleted in the S3 bucket.

                                   FailureDetails -> (structure)
                                      Provides  detailed information about the
                                      data repository if its Lifecycle is  set
                                      to MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

                                      Message -> (string)
                                          A detailed error message.

                               DeploymentType -> (string)
                                   The  deployment  type of the FSx for Lustre
                                   file system. Scratch deployment type is de-
                                   signed    for    temporary    storage   and
                                   shorter-term processing of data.
                                      SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2 deployment types
                                      are best suited for when you need tempo-
                                      rary storage and shorter-term processing
                                      of  data.  The SCRATCH_2 deployment type
                                      provides in-transit encryption  of  data
                                      and  higher  burst  throughput  capacity
                                      than SCRATCH_1 .

                                   The PERSISTENT_1 and  PERSISTENT_2  deploy-
                                   ment  type  is used for longer-term storage
                                   and workloads and  encryption  of  data  in
                                   transit.  PERSISTENT_2  offers  higher  Pe-
                                   rUnitStorageThroughput    (up    to    1000
                                   MB/s/TiB)  along with a lower minimum stor-
                                   age  capacity  requirement  (600  GiB).  To

                                   The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                               PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                                   Per  unit storage throughput represents the
                                   megabytes  per  second  of  read  or  write
                                   throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage provi-
                                   sioned. File system throughput capacity  is
                                   equal  to Storage capacity (TiB) * PerUnit-
                                   StorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB).  This  option
                                   is  only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSIS-
                                   TENT_2 deployment types.

                                   Valid values:

                                   o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD  storage:  50,  100,
                                     200.

                                   o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                                   o For  PERSISTENT_2  SSD storage: 125, 250,
                                     500, 1000.

                               MountName -> (string)
                                   You use the MountName value  when  mounting
                                   the file system.

                                   For  the  SCRATCH_1  deployment  type, this
                                   value is always "fsx  ".  For  SCRATCH_2  ,
                                   PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 deployment
                                   types, this  value  is  a  string  that  is
                                   unique  within  an  Amazon Web Services Re-
                                   gion.

                               DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                   A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM
                                   .  HH  is  the  zero-padded hour of the day
                                   (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded minute of
                                   the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM
                                   daily.

                               AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                   The number  of  days  to  retain  automatic
                                   backups.  Setting  this  property to 0 dis-
                                   ables automatic backups. You can retain au-
                                   tomatic  backups  for a maximum of 90 days.
                                   The default is 30 .

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A boolean flag indicating whether  tags  on
                                   the  file  system are copied to backups. If
                                   it's set to true, all tags on the file sys-
                                   tem are copied to all automatic backups and
                                   any user-initiated backups where  the  user
                                   doesn't  specify any tags. If this value is
                                   true, and you specify  one  or  more  tags,
                                   only the specified tags are copied to back-
                                   ups. If you specify one or more  tags  when
                                   creating  a  user-initiated backup, no tags
                                   are copied from the file system, regardless
                                   of this value. (Default = false)

                               DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                   The  type  of  drive  cache used by PERSIS-
                                   TENT_1 file systems  that  are  provisioned
                                   with HDD storage devices. This parameter is
                                   required when StorageType is HDD. When  set
                                   to  READ the file system has an SSD storage
                                   cache that is sized to 20% of the file sys-
                                   tem's  storage  capacity. This improves the
                                   performance for frequently  accessed  files
                                   by  caching  up to 20% of the total storage
                                   capacity.

                                   This parameter is required when StorageType
                                   is set to HDD.

                               DataCompressionType -> (string)

                                   The Lustre  logging  configuration.  Lustre
                                   logging  writes  the enabled log events for
                                   your file system to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                                   Level -> (string)
                                      The  data  repository  events  that  are
                                      logged by Amazon FSx.

                                      o WARN_ONLY  -  only  warning events are
                                        logged.

                                      o ERROR_ONLY -  only  error  events  are
                                        logged.

                                      o WARN_ERROR  -  both warning events and
                                        error events are logged.

                                      o DISABLED - logging of data  repository
                                        events is turned off.

                                      Note  that  Amazon File Cache uses a de-
                                      fault  setting  of  WARN_ERROR  ,  which
                                      can't be changed.

                                   Destination -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that
                                      specifies the destination of  the  logs.
                                      The destination can be any Amazon Cloud-
                                      Watch Logs log group ARN.  The  destina-
                                      tion  ARN must be in the same Amazon Web
                                      Services partition, Amazon Web  Services
                                      Region,  and Amazon Web Services account
                                      as your Amazon FSx file system.

                               RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The Lustre root squash configuration for an
                                   Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. When en-
                                   abled, root squash restricts root-level ac-
                                   cess  from  clients that try to access your
                                   file system as a root user.

                                   RootSquash -> (string)
                                      You enable root squash by setting a user
                                      ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for the file
                                      system in the format UID:GID (for  exam-
                                      ple,  365534:65534  ).  The  UID and GID
                                      values can range from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                      o A non-zero value for UID and  GID  en-
                                        ables  root  squash.  The  UID and GID
                                        values can be different, but each must
                                        be a non-zero value.

                                      o A  value  of  0 (zero) for UID and GID
                                        indicates root, and therefore disables
                                        root squash.

                                      When root squash is enabled, the user ID
                                      and group ID of a  root  user  accessing
                                      the file system are re-mapped to the UID
                                      and GID you provide.

                                   NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                      When root squash is enabled, you can op-
                                      tionally  specify  an  array  of NIDs of
                                      clients for which root squash  does  not
                                      apply.  A client NID is a Lustre Network
                                      Identifier used to uniquely  identify  a
                                      client.  You  can specify the NID as ei-
                                      ther a single address or a range of  ad-
                                      dresses:

                                   backups.  Setting  this  property to 0 dis-
                                   ables automatic backups. You can retain au-
                                   tomatic  backups  for a maximum of 90 days.
                                   The default is 30 .

                               DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                   A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM
                                   .  HH  is  the  zero-padded hour of the day
                                   (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded minute of
                                   the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM
                                   daily.

                                   This value defaults to false . If it's  set
                                   to  true  ,  all  tags  for  the volume are
                                   copied to snapshots where the user  doesn't
                                   specify tags. If this value is true and you
                                   specify one or more tags, only  the  speci-
                                   fied  tags  are copied to snapshots. If you
                                   specify one or more tags when creating  the
                                   snapshot,  no tags are copied from the vol-

                                 recoverable state.

                               o PENDING  - Amazon FSx hasn't started creating
                                 the volume.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the volume.

                            OntapConfiguration -> (structure)
                               The configuration of an Amazon FSx  for  NetApp
                               ONTAP volume.

                               FlexCacheEndpointType -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the  FlexCache  endpoint type of
                                   the volume. Valid values are the following:

                                   o NONE specifies that  the  volume  doesn't
                                     have  a  FlexCache configuration. NONE is
                                     the default.

                                   o ORIGIN specifies that the volume  is  the
                                     origin volume for a FlexCache volume.

                                   o CACHE  specifies  that  the  volume  is a
                                     FlexCache volume.

                               JunctionPath -> (string)
                                   Specifies the  directory  that  network-at-
                                   tached  storage  (NAS) clients use to mount
                                   the volume, along with the storage  virtual
                                   machine (SVM) Domain Name System (DNS) name
                                   or IP address. You can create  a  Junction-
                                   Path  directly  below a parent volume junc-
                                   tion or on a directory within a  volume.  A
                                   JunctionPath  for a volume named vol3 might
                                   be /vol1/vol2/vol3 , or  /vol1/dir2/vol3  ,
                                   or even /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                               SecurityStyle -> (string)
                                   The  security  style  for the volume, which
                                   can be UNIX , NTFS , or MIXED .

                               SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                                   The  configured  size  of  the  volume,  in
                                   megabytes (MBs).

                               StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                                   The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                               StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                   The  ID of the volume's storage virtual ma-
                                   chine.

                               StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                   A Boolean flag indicating whether this vol-
                                   ume is the root volume for its storage vir-
                                   tual machine (SVM). Only one volume  on  an
                                   SVM  can be the root volume. This value de-
                                   faults to false . If this value is  true  ,
                                   then this is the SVM root volume.

                                   This flag is useful when you're deleting an
                                   SVM, because  you  must  first  delete  all
                                   non-root  volumes.  This  flag, when set to
                                   false , helps you identify which volumes to
                                   delete before you can delete the SVM.

                               TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                                   The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                                      Specifies  the  number of days that user
                                      data in a volume  must  remain  inactive
                                      before it is considered "cold" and moved
                                      to the capacity pool. Used with the AUTO
                                      and  SNAPSHOT_ONLY tiering policies. En-
                                      ter a whole number between  2  and  183.
                                      Default  values are 31 days for AUTO and
                                      2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      Specifies the  tiering  policy  used  to
                                      transition  data. Default value is SNAP-
                                      SHOT_ONLY .

                                      o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves  cold  snapshots
                                        to the capacity pool storage tier.

                                      o AUTO  - moves cold user data and snap-
                                        shots to  the  capacity  pool  storage
                                        tier based on your access patterns.

                                      o ALL  -  moves  all user data blocks in
                                        both the active file system and  Snap-
                                        shot copies to the storage pool tier.

                                      o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in the
                                        primary storage  tier,  preventing  it
                                        from  being moved to the capacity pool
                                        tier.

                               UUID -> (string)
                                   The volume's universally unique  identifier
                                   (UUID).

                               OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the type of volume. Valid values
                                   are the following:

                                   o RW specifies a read/write volume.  RW  is
                                     the default.

                                   o DP  specifies  a  data-protection volume.
                                     You can protect data by replicating it to
                                     data-protection  mirror copies. If a dis-
                                     aster occurs, you can use these data-pro-
                                     tection mirror copies to recover data.

                                   o LS  specifies  a load-sharing mirror vol-
                                     ume. A load-sharing  mirror  reduces  the
                                     network  traffic  to  a FlexVol volume by
                                     providing additional read-only access  to
                                     clients.

                               SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the snapshot policy for the vol-
                                   ume.  There  are  three  built-in  snapshot
                                   policies:

                                   o default  :  This is the default policy. A
                                     maximum of  six  hourly  snapshots  taken
                                     five  minutes past the hour. A maximum of
                                     two daily snapshots taken Monday  through
                                     Saturday  at 10 minutes after midnight. A
                                     maximum of two weekly snapshots taken ev-
                                     ery Sunday at 15 minutes after midnight.

                                   o default-1weekly : This policy is the same
                                     as the default policy except that it only
                                     retains  one  snapshot  from  the  weekly
                                     schedule.

                                   o none : This  policy  does  not  take  any
                                     snapshots. This policy can be assigned to
                                     volumes to  prevent  automatic  snapshots
                                     from being taken.

                                   You  can  also provide the name of a custom
                                   policy that you created with the ONTAP  CLI
                                   or REST API.

                                   For more information, see Snapshot policies
                                   in the Amazon FSx  for  NetApp  ONTAP  User
                                   Guide .

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A  boolean flag indicating whether tags for
                                   the volume should  be  copied  to  backups.
                                   This  value  defaults to false. If it's set
                                   to true, all tags for the volume are copied
                                   to all automatic and user-initiated backups
                                   where the user  doesn't  specify  tags.  If
                                   this  value is true, and you specify one or
                                   more tags,  only  the  specified  tags  are
                                   copied  to  backups.  If you specify one or
                                   more tags when  creating  a  user-initiated
                                   backup, no tags are copied from the volume,
                                   regardless of this value.

                               SnaplockConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The SnapLock configuration  object  for  an
                                   FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                                   AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                                      Enables or disables the audit log volume
                                      for an FSx for  ONTAP  SnapLock  volume.
                                      The  default value is false . If you set
                                      AuditLogVolume to true  ,  the  SnapLock
                                      volume  is  created as an audit log vol-
                                      ume. The minimum retention period for an
                                      audit log volume is six months.

                                      For more information, see SnapLock audit
                                      log volumes .

                                   AutocommitPeriod -> (structure)
                                      The configuration object for setting the
                                      autocommit period of files in an FSx for
                                      ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          Defines the type of time for the au-
                                          tocommit  period of a file in an FSx
                                          for ONTAP SnapLock  volume.  Setting
                                          this value to NONE disables autocom-
                                          mit. The default value is NONE .

                                      Value -> (integer)
                                          Defines the amount of time  for  the
                                          autocommit  period  of  a file in an
                                          FSx for ONTAP SnapLock  volume.  The
                                          following ranges are valid:

                                          o Minutes : 5 - 65,535

                                      don't have to be unique in  a  tag  set.
                                      For  example,  you  can have a key-value
                                      pair in a tag set of  finances  :  April
                                      and also of payroll : April .

                            VolumeType -> (string)
                               The type of the volume.

                            LifecycleTransitionReason -> (structure)
                               The  reason  why  the  volume  lifecycle status
                               changed.

                               Message -> (string)
                                   A detailed error message.

                               The configuration of an Amazon FSx for  OpenZFS
                               volume.

                               ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the parent volume.

                               VolumePath -> (string)
                                   The  path  to the volume from the root vol-
                                   ume. For example,  fsx/parentVolume/volume1
                                   .

                               StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                   The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to
                                   reserve from the parent volume.  You  can't
                                   reserve more storage than the parent volume
                                   has reserved.

                               StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                   The maximum amount of storage in  gibibtyes
                                   (GiB) that the volume can use from its par-
                                   ent. You can specify a  quota  larger  than
                                   the storage on the parent volume.

                               RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                   The  record  size  of an OpenZFS volume, in
                                   kibibytes (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8, 16,
                                   32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB. The de-
                                   fault is 128 KiB. Most workloads should use
                                   the  default  record  size. For guidance on
                                   when to set a custom record size,  see  the
                                   Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

                               DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the  method used to compress the
                                   data on the volume. The compression type is
                                   NONE by default.

                                   o NONE  -  Doesn't compress the data on the
                                     volume. NONE is the default.

                                   o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the  volume
                                     using  the  Zstandard  (ZSTD) compression
                                     algorithm. Compared  to  LZ4,  Z-Standard
                                     provides  a  better  compression ratio to
                                     minimize on-disk storage utilization.

                                   o LZ4 - Compresses the data in  the  volume
                                     using the LZ4 compression algorithm. Com-
                                     pared to Z-Standard,  LZ4  is  less  com-
                                     pute-intensive  and delivers higher write
                                     throughput speeds.

                               CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                   A Boolean value indicating whether tags for
                                   the  volume  should be copied to snapshots.
                                   This value defaults to false . If it's  set
                                   to  true  ,  all  tags  for  the volume are
                                   copied to snapshots where the user  doesn't
                                   specify tags. If this value is true and you
                                   specify one or more tags, only  the  speci-
                                   fied  tags  are copied to snapshots. If you
                                   specify one or more tags when creating  the
                                   snapshot,  no tags are copied from the vol-
                                   ume, regardless of this value.

                               OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                   The configuration object that specifies the
                                   snapshot  to  use as the origin of the data
                                   for the volume.

                                   SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a
                                      given  resource.  ARNs uniquely identify
                                      Amazon Web Services  resources.  We  re-
                                      quire  an ARN when you need to specify a
                                      resource  unambiguously  across  all  of
                                      Amazon  Web  Services. For more informa-

                                   CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                      The strategy used when copying data from
                                      the snapshot to the new volume.

                                      o CLONE  - The new volume references the
                                        data in the origin snapshot. Cloning a
                                        snapshot  is  faster  than copying the
                                        data from a snapshot to a  new  volume
                                        and  doesn't  consume disk throughput.
                                        However, the origin snapshot can't  be
                                        deleted if there is a volume using its
                                        copied data.

                                      o FULL_COPY - Copies all data  from  the
                                        snapshot to the new volume.

                               ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                   A Boolean value indicating whether the vol-
                                   ume is read-only.

                               NfsExports -> (list)
                                   The configuration  object  for  mounting  a
                                   Network File System (NFS) file system.

                                   (structure)
                                      The Network File System (NFS) configura-
                                      tions for mounting  an  Amazon  FSx  for
                                      OpenZFS file system.

                                      ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                                          A list of configuration objects that
                                          contain the client and  options  for
                                          mounting the OpenZFS file system.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies  who can mount an Open-
                                             ZFS file system and  the  options
                                             available while mounting the file
                                             system.

                                             Clients -> (string)
                                                 A value  that  specifies  who
                                                 can  mount  the  file system.
                                                 You can  provide  a  wildcard
                                                 character (* ), an IP address
                                                 (0.0.0.0 ), or a CIDR address
                                                 (192.0.2.0/24  ). By default,
                                                 Amazon FSx uses the  wildcard
                                                 character when specifying the
                                                 client.

                                             Options -> (list)
                                                 The  options  to   use   when
                                                 mounting the file system. For
                                                 a list of  options  that  you
                                                 can  use  with  Network  File

                                                 When choosing  your  options,
                                                 consider the following:

                                                 o crossmnt  is  used  by  de-
                                                   fault. If you don't specify
                                                   crossmnt  when changing the
                                                   client  configuration,  you

                                                 o sync is used by default. If
                                                   you instead specify async ,
                                                   the   system   acknowledges
                                                   writes  before  writing  to
                                                   disk. If the system crashes

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          A  value  that specifies whether the
                                          quota applies to a user or group.

                                      Id -> (integer)
                                          The ID of the user or group.

                        which the endpoints to access your file system will be
                        created.  By  default in the Amazon FSx API and Amazon
                        FSx console, Amazon FSx selects an  available  /28  IP
                        address  range  for  you  from  one  of the VPC's CIDR
                        ranges. You can have overlapping endpoint IP addresses
                        for  file  systems  deployed in the same VPC/route ta-

                        Specifies  the  FlexCache endpoint type of the volume.
                        Valid values are the following:

                        o NONE specifies that the volume doesn't have a  Flex-
                          Cache configuration. NONE is the default.

                        o ORIGIN  specifies that the volume is the origin vol-
                          ume for a FlexCache volume.

                        o CACHE specifies that the volume is a FlexCache  vol-

                     JunctionPath -> (string)
                        Specifies  the directory that network-attached storage
                        (NAS) clients use to mount the volume, along with  the
                        storage virtual machine (SVM) Domain Name System (DNS)
                        name or IP address. You can create a JunctionPath  di-
                        rectly  below  a parent volume junction or on a direc-
                        tory within a volume.  A  JunctionPath  for  a  volume
                        named    vol3    might   be   /vol1/vol2/vol3   ,   or
                        /vol1/dir2/vol3 , or even /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                     SecurityStyle -> (string)
                        The security style for the volume, which can be UNIX ,
                        NTFS , or MIXED .

                     SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                        The configured size of the volume, in megabytes (MBs).

                     StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                        A  Boolean  flag indicating whether this volume is the
                        root volume for its  storage  virtual  machine  (SVM).
                        Only one volume on an SVM can be the root volume. This
                        value defaults to false . If this value is true , then
                        this is the SVM root volume.

                        This  flag  is useful when you're deleting an SVM, be-
                        cause you must first delete all non-root volumes. This
                        flag,  when  set  to  false , helps you identify which
                        volumes to delete before you can delete the SVM.

                     TieringPolicy -> (structure)

                            volume  must  remain inactive before it is consid-
                            ered "cold" and moved to the capacity  pool.  Used
                            with  the AUTO and SNAPSHOT_ONLY tiering policies.
                            Enter a whole number between 2  and  183.  Default
                            values  are  31 days for AUTO and 2 days for SNAP-
                            SHOT_ONLY .

                        Name -> (string)
                            Specifies the tiering policy  used  to  transition
                            data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                            o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  - moves cold snapshots to the ca-
                              pacity pool storage tier.

                            o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots to the
                              capacity  pool storage tier based on your access
                              patterns.

                            o ALL - moves all user data blocks in both the ac-
                              tive  file  system  and  Snapshot  copies to the
                              storage pool tier.

                            o NONE - keeps a  volume's  data  in  the  primary
                              storage  tier, preventing it from being moved to
                              the capacity pool tier.

                     UUID -> (string)
                        The volume's universally unique identifier (UUID).

                     OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                        Specifies the type of volume.  Valid  values  are  the
                        following:

                        o RW specifies a read/write volume. RW is the default.

                        o DP  specifies a data-protection volume. You can pro-
                          tect data by replicating it to data-protection  mir-
                          ror  copies. If a disaster occurs, you can use these
                          data-protection mirror copies to recover data.

                        o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror   volume.   A
                          load-sharing mirror reduces the network traffic to a
                          FlexVol volume by providing additional read-only ac-
                          cess to clients.

                     SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                        Specifies  the  snapshot  policy for the volume. There
                        are three built-in snapshot policies:

                        o default : This is the default policy. A  maximum  of
                          six  hourly  snapshots  taken  five minutes past the
                          hour. A maximum of two daily snapshots taken  Monday
                          through  Saturday  at  10  minutes after midnight. A
                          maximum of two weekly snapshots taken  every  Sunday
                          at 15 minutes after midnight.

                        o default-1weekly : This policy is the same as the de-
                          fault policy except that it only retains  one  snap-
                          shot from the weekly schedule.

                        o none : This policy does not take any snapshots. This
                          policy can be assigned to volumes to  prevent  auto-
                          matic snapshots from being taken.

                        You  can also provide the name of a custom policy that
                        you created with the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                        For more information, see  Snapshot  policies  in  the
                        Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide .

                     CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                        A  boolean flag indicating whether tags for the volume
                        should be copied to backups. This  value  defaults  to
                        false.  If  it's  set to true, all tags for the volume
                        are copied to all automatic and user-initiated backups
                        where  the user doesn't specify tags. If this value is
                        true, and you specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                        ified  tags  are copied to backups. If you specify one
                        or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no
                        tags  are  copied  from the volume, regardless of this
                        value.

                     SnaplockConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The SnapLock configuration object for an FSx for ONTAP
                        SnapLock volume.

                        AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                            Enables  or  disables  the audit log volume for an
                            FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume. The  default  value
                            is false . If you set AuditLogVolume to true , the
                            SnapLock volume is created as an audit log volume.
                            The minimum retention period for an audit log vol-
                            ume is six months.

                            For more information, see SnapLock audit log  vol-
                            umes .

                            mit period of files in an FSx for  ONTAP  SnapLock
                            volume.

                            Type -> (string)
                               Defines the type of time for the autocommit pe-
                               riod of a file in an  FSx  for  ONTAP  SnapLock
                               volume. Setting this value to NONE disables au-
                               tocommit. The default value is NONE .

                            Value -> (integer)
                               Defines the amount of time for  the  autocommit
                               period  of  a file in an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock
                               volume. The following ranges are valid:

                               o Minutes : 5 - 65,535

                               o Hours : 1 - 65,535

                               o Days : 1 - 3,650

                               o Months : 1 - 120

                               o Years : 1 - 10

                        PrivilegedDelete -> (string)
                            Enables, disables, or permanently disables  privi-
                            leged  delete  on an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock Enter-
                            prise volume. Enabling  privileged  delete  allows
                            SnapLock administrators to delete write once, read
                            many (WORM) files even if they have active  reten-
                            tion  periods.  PERMANENTLY_DISABLED is a terminal
                            state. If privileged delete  is  permanently  dis-
                            abled  on  a  SnapLock volume, you can't re-enable
                            it. The default value is DISABLED .

                            For more information, see Privileged delete .

                        RetentionPeriod -> (structure)
                            Specifies the retention period of an FSx for ONTAP
                            SnapLock volume.

                            DefaultRetention -> (structure)

                            SnapLock volume. After it  is  set,  it  can't  be
                            changed.  You  can choose one of the following re-
                            tention modes:

                            o COMPLIANCE : Files transitioned to  write  once,
                              read many (WORM) on a Compliance volume can't be
                              deleted until their  retention  periods  expire.
                              This  retention  mode is used to address govern-
                              ment or industry-specific mandates or to protect
                              against  ransomware  attacks.  For more informa-
                              tion, see SnapLock Compliance .

                            o ENTERPRISE : Files transitioned to  WORM  on  an
                              Enterprise  volume  can be deleted by authorized
                              users before their retention periods expire  us-
                              ing  privileged  delete.  This retention mode is
                              used to advance an organization's data integrity
                              and  internal  compliance  or  to test retention
                              settings before using SnapLock  Compliance.  For
                              more information, see SnapLock Enterprise .

                        VolumeAppendModeEnabled -> (boolean)
                            Enables  or  disables volume-append mode on an FSx
                            for ONTAP SnapLock volume. Volume-append mode  al-
                            lows you to create WORM-appendable files and write
                            data to them incrementally. The default  value  is
                            false .

                 ResourceARN -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given resource. ARNs
                     uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources.  We  re-
                     quire  an  ARN  when you need to specify a resource unam-
                     biguously across all of Amazon Web Services. For more in-
                     formation, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon
                     Web Services General Reference .

                 Tags -> (list)
                     A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                        Key -> (string)
                            A value that specifies the TagKey ,  the  name  of
                            the  tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource
                            to which they are attached.

                        Value -> (string)
                            A value that specifies the TagValue  ,  the  value
                            assigned  to the corresponding tag key. Tag values
                            can be null and don't have to be unique in  a  tag
                            set. For example, you can have a key-value pair in
                            a tag set of finances : April and also of  payroll
                            : April .

                     Message -> (string)
                        A detailed error message.

                 AdministrativeActions -> (list)
                     A  list of administrative actions for the volume that are
                     in process or waiting to be processed. Administrative ac-
                     tions describe changes to the volume that you have initi-
                     ated using the UpdateVolume action.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative  action
                        for  the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS file sys-
                        tem.

                        AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                            Describes the type of  administrative  action,  as
                            follows:

                            o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system update admin-
                              istrative action initiated from the  Amazon  FSx
                              console,  API  (UpdateFileSystem  ), or CLI (up-
                              date-file-system ).

                            o THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION -  After  the  FILE_SYS-
                              TEM_UPDATE  task  to  increase  a  file system's
                              throughput capacity has been completed  success-
                              fully,  a  THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION  task starts.
                              You can track the storage-optimization  progress
                              using   the   ProgressPercent   property.   When
                              THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION has been completed  suc-
                              cessfully,  the parent FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE action
                              status changes to COMPLETED . For more  informa-

                              Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide .

                            o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION - After the FILE_SYSTEM_UP-
                              DATE  task  to  increase a file system's storage
                              capacity  has  been  completed  successfully,  a
                              STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                              o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization is
                                the process of migrating the file system  data
                                to newer larger disks.

                              o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists of
                                rebalancing the data across the  existing  and
                                newly added file servers.

                            You  can  track  the storage-optimization progress
                            using the  ProgressPercent  property.  When  STOR-
                            AGE_OPTIMIZATION  has been completed successfully,
                            the  parent   FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE   action   status
                            changes  to  COMPLETED . For more information, see

                                   The  number  of  days  to  retain automatic
                                   backups. Setting this to 0  disables  auto-
                                   matic  backups.  You  can  retain automatic
                                   backups for a maximum of 90 days.

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A boolean flag indicating whether  tags  on
                                   the  file  system should be copied to back-
                                   ups. This value defaults to false. If  it's
                                   set  to  true,  all tags on the file system
                                   are copied to all automatic backups and any

                                   only the specified tags are copied to back-
                                   ups.  If  you specify one or more tags when
                                   creating a user-initiated backup,  no  tags
                                   are copied from the file system, regardless
                                   of this value.

                                   FSx file system. Aliases allow you  to  use
                                   existing  DNS  names  to access the data in
                                   your Amazon FSx file system. You can  asso-
                                   ciate  up  to 50 aliases with a file system
                                   at any time. You can  associate  additional
                                   DNS  aliases after you create the file sys-
                                   tem  using  the  AssociateFileSystemAliases
                                   operation.  You can remove DNS aliases from
                                   the file system after it is  created  using
                                   the   DisassociateFileSystemAliases  opera-
                                   tion. You only need to  specify  the  alias
                                   name  in  the request payload. For more in-

                                      S3 durable data  repository,  if  it  is
                                      configured  with  an  S3 repository. The
                                      lifecycle can have the following values:

                                      o CREATING - The data repository config-
                                        uration  between  the  FSx file system
                                        and the linked S3 data  repository  is
                                        being  created. The data repository is
                                        unavailable.

                                      o AVAILABLE -  The  data  repository  is
                                        available for use.

                                      o MISCONFIGURED  - Amazon FSx cannot au-
                                        tomatically import updates from the S3
                                        bucket  until the data repository con-
                                        figuration is corrected. For more  in-
                                        formation,  see Troubleshooting a Mis-
                                        configured linked S3 bucket .

                                      o UPDATING - The data repository is  un-
                                        dergoing  a  customer initiated update
                                        and availability may be impacted.

                                      o FAILED - The data repository is  in  a
                                        terminal  state  that cannot be recov-
                                        ered.

                                      (and  optional prefix) that you're using
                                      as the data repository for your FSx  for
                                      Lustre file system, for example s3://im-
                                      port-bucket/optional-prefix . If a  pre-
                                      fix  is  specified  after  the Amazon S3
                                      bucket name, only object keys with  that
                                      prefix are loaded into the file system.

                                      in S3.

                                   ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                                      For files imported from a  data  reposi-
                                      tory,  this  value determines the stripe
                                      count and maximum  amount  of  data  per
                                      file  (in MiB) stored on a single physi-
                                      cal disk. The maximum  number  of  disks
                                      that a single file can be striped across
                                      is limited by the total number of  disks
                                      that make up the file system.

                                      The  default  chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1
                                      GiB) and can go as high as  512,000  MiB
                                      (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a max-
                                      imum size of 5 TB.

                                      AutoImportPolicy configures  how  Amazon
                                      FSx  keeps your file and directory list-
                                      ings up to date as you add or modify ob-
                                      jects  in your linked S3 bucket. AutoIm-
                                      portPolicy can have the  following  val-
                                      ues:

                                      o NONE  -  (Default)  AutoImport is off.

                                      data repository if its Lifecycle is  set
                                      to MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

                                      Message -> (string)
                                          A detailed error message.

                               DeploymentType -> (string)
                                   The  deployment  type of the FSx for Lustre
                                   file system. Scratch deployment type is de-
                                   signed    for    temporary    storage   and
                                   shorter-term processing of data.
                                      SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2 deployment types
                                      are best suited for when you need tempo-
                                      rary storage and shorter-term processing
                                      of  data.  The SCRATCH_2 deployment type
                                      provides in-transit encryption  of  data
                                      and  higher  burst  throughput  capacity
                                      than SCRATCH_1 .

                                   The PERSISTENT_1 and  PERSISTENT_2  deploy-
                                   ment  type  is used for longer-term storage
                                   and workloads and  encryption  of  data  in
                                   transit.  PERSISTENT_2  offers  higher  Pe-
                                   rUnitStorageThroughput    (up    to    1000
                                   MB/s/TiB)  along with a lower minimum stor-
                                   age  capacity  requirement  (600  GiB).  To

                                   The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                               PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                                   Per  unit storage throughput represents the
                                   megabytes  per  second  of  read  or  write
                                   throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage provi-
                                   sioned. File system throughput capacity  is
                                   equal  to Storage capacity (TiB) * PerUnit-
                                   StorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB).  This  option
                                   is  only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSIS-
                                   TENT_2 deployment types.

                                   Valid values:

                                   o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD  storage:  50,  100,
                                     200.

                                   o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                                   o For  PERSISTENT_2  SSD storage: 125, 250,
                                     500, 1000.

                               MountName -> (string)
                                   You use the MountName value  when  mounting
                                   the file system.

                                   For  the  SCRATCH_1  deployment  type, this
                                   value is always "fsx  ".  For  SCRATCH_2  ,
                                   PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 deployment
                                   types, this  value  is  a  string  that  is
                                   unique  within  an  Amazon Web Services Re-
                                   gion.

                               DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                   A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM
                                   .  HH  is  the  zero-padded hour of the day
                                   (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded minute of
                                   the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM
                                   daily.

                               AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                   The number  of  days  to  retain  automatic
                                   backups.  Setting  this  property to 0 dis-
                                   ables automatic backups. You can retain au-
                                   tomatic  backups  for a maximum of 90 days.
                                   The default is 30 .

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A boolean flag indicating whether  tags  on
                                   the  file  system are copied to backups. If
                                   it's set to true, all tags on the file sys-
                                   tem are copied to all automatic backups and
                                   any user-initiated backups where  the  user
                                   doesn't  specify any tags. If this value is
                                   true, and you specify  one  or  more  tags,
                                   only the specified tags are copied to back-
                                   ups. If you specify one or more  tags  when
                                   creating  a  user-initiated backup, no tags
                                   are copied from the file system, regardless
                                   of this value. (Default = false)

                               DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                   The  type  of  drive  cache used by PERSIS-
                                   TENT_1 file systems  that  are  provisioned
                                   with HDD storage devices. This parameter is
                                   required when StorageType is HDD. When  set
                                   to  READ the file system has an SSD storage
                                   cache that is sized to 20% of the file sys-
                                   tem's  storage  capacity. This improves the
                                   performance for frequently  accessed  files
                                   by  caching  up to 20% of the total storage
                                   capacity.

                                   This parameter is required when StorageType
                                   is set to HDD.

                               DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                   The  data compression configuration for the
                                   file system. DataCompressionType  can  have
                                   the following values:

                                   o NONE - Data compression is turned off for
                                     the file system.

                                   o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on  with
                                     the LZ4 algorithm.

                               LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The Lustre  logging  configuration.  Lustre
                                   logging  writes  the enabled log events for
                                   your file system to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                                   Level -> (string)
                                      The  data  repository  events  that  are
                                      logged by Amazon FSx.

                                      o WARN_ONLY  -  only  warning events are
                                        logged.

                                      o ERROR_ONLY -  only  error  events  are
                                        logged.

                                      o WARN_ERROR  -  both warning events and
                                        error events are logged.

                                      o DISABLED - logging of data  repository
                                        events is turned off.

                                      Note  that  Amazon File Cache uses a de-
                                      fault  setting  of  WARN_ERROR  ,  which
                                      can't be changed.

                                   Destination -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that
                                      specifies the destination of  the  logs.
                                      The destination can be any Amazon Cloud-
                                      Watch Logs log group ARN.  The  destina-
                                      tion  ARN must be in the same Amazon Web
                                      Services partition, Amazon Web  Services
                                      Region,  and Amazon Web Services account
                                      as your Amazon FSx file system.

                               RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The Lustre root squash configuration for an
                                   Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. When en-
                                   abled, root squash restricts root-level ac-
                                   cess  from  clients that try to access your
                                   file system as a root user.

                                   RootSquash -> (string)
                                      You enable root squash by setting a user
                                      ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for the file
                                      system in the format UID:GID (for  exam-
                                      ple,  365534:65534  ).  The  UID and GID
                                      values can range from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                      o A non-zero value for UID and  GID  en-
                                        ables  root  squash.  The  UID and GID
                                        values can be different, but each must
                                        be a non-zero value.

                                      o A  value  of  0 (zero) for UID and GID
                                        indicates root, and therefore disables
                                        root squash.

                                      When root squash is enabled, the user ID
                                      and group ID of a  root  user  accessing
                                      the file system are re-mapped to the UID
                                      and GID you provide.

                                   NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                      When root squash is enabled, you can op-
                                      tionally  specify  an  array  of NIDs of
                                      clients for which root squash  does  not

                                   A Boolean flag indicating whether this vol-
                                   ume is the root volume for its storage vir-
                                   tual machine (SVM). Only one volume  on  an
                                   SVM  can be the root volume. This value de-
                                   faults to false . If this value is  true  ,
                                   then this is the SVM root volume.

                                   This flag is useful when you're deleting an
                                   SVM, because  you  must  first  delete  all
                                   non-root  volumes.  This  flag, when set to
                                   false , helps you identify which volumes to
                                   delete before you can delete the SVM.

                               TieringPolicy -> (structure)

                                      before it is considered "cold" and moved
                                      to the capacity pool. Used with the AUTO
                                      and  SNAPSHOT_ONLY tiering policies. En-
                                      ter a whole number between  2  and  183.
                                      Default  values are 31 days for AUTO and
                                      2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                        to the capacity pool storage tier.

                                      o AUTO  - moves cold user data and snap-
                                        shots to  the  capacity  pool  storage
                                        tier based on your access patterns.

                                      o ALL  -  moves  all user data blocks in

                                      o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in the
                                        primary storage  tier,  preventing  it
                                        from  being moved to the capacity pool
                                        tier.

                                     ume. A load-sharing  mirror  reduces  the
                                     network  traffic  to  a FlexVol volume by
                                     providing additional read-only access  to
                                     clients.

                               SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the snapshot policy for the vol-
                                   ume.  There  are  three  built-in  snapshot
                                   policies:

                                   o default  :  This is the default policy. A
                                     maximum of  six  hourly  snapshots  taken
                                     five  minutes past the hour. A maximum of
                                     two daily snapshots taken Monday  through
                                     Saturday  at 10 minutes after midnight. A
                                     maximum of two weekly snapshots taken ev-
                                     ery Sunday at 15 minutes after midnight.

                                   o default-1weekly : This policy is the same
                                     as the default policy except that it only
                                     retains  one  snapshot  from  the  weekly
                                     schedule.

                                   o none : This  policy  does  not  take  any
                                     snapshots. This policy can be assigned to
                                     volumes to  prevent  automatic  snapshots
                                     from being taken.

                                   You  can  also provide the name of a custom
                                   policy that you created with the ONTAP  CLI
                                   or REST API.

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A  boolean flag indicating whether tags for
                                   the volume should  be  copied  to  backups.
                                   This  value  defaults to false. If it's set
                                   to true, all tags for the volume are copied
                                   to all automatic and user-initiated backups
                                   where the user  doesn't  specify  tags.  If
                                   this  value is true, and you specify one or
                                   more tags,  only  the  specified  tags  are
                                   copied  to  backups.  If you specify one or
                                   more tags when  creating  a  user-initiated
                                   backup, no tags are copied from the volume,
                                   regardless of this value.

                               SnaplockConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The SnapLock configuration  object  for  an
                                   FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                                   AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                                      Enables or disables the audit log volume
                                      for an FSx for  ONTAP  SnapLock  volume.
                                      The  default value is false . If you set
                                      AuditLogVolume to true  ,  the  SnapLock
                                      volume  is  created as an audit log vol-
                                      ume. The minimum retention period for an
                                      audit log volume is six months.

                                      The configuration object for setting the
                                      autocommit period of files in an FSx for
                                      ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          Defines the type of time for the au-
                                          tocommit  period of a file in an FSx
                                          for ONTAP SnapLock  volume.  Setting
                                          this value to NONE disables autocom-
                                          mit. The default value is NONE .

                                      Value -> (integer)
                                          Defines the amount of time  for  the

                                      ONTAP  SnapLock  Enterprise  volume. En-
                                      abling privileged delete allows SnapLock
                                      administrators  to  delete  write  once,

                                          Type -> (string)
                                             Defines the type of time for  the
                                             retention  period  of  an FSx for
                                             ONTAP SnapLock volume. Set it  to
                                             one  of  the  valid types. If you
                                             set it to INFINITE  ,  the  files
                                             are  retained forever. If you set
                                             it to UNSPECIFIED , the files are
                                             retained  until  you  set  an ex-
                                             plicit retention period.

                                          Value -> (integer)
                                             Defines the amount  of  time  for
                                             the  retention  period  of an FSx
                                             for ONTAP  SnapLock  volume.  You
                                             can't set a value for INFINITE or
                                             UNSPECIFIED . For all  other  op-

                                   VolumeAppendModeEnabled -> (boolean)
                                      Enables or disables  volume-append  mode
                                      on  an  FSx  for  ONTAP SnapLock volume.
                                      Volume-append mode allows you to  create
                                      WORM-appendable  files and write data to
                                      them incrementally. The default value is
                                      false .

                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given  re-
                               source.  ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Ser-
                               vices resources. We require  an  ARN  when  you
                               need to specify a resource unambiguously across
                               all of Amazon Web Services. For  more  informa-

                                   Specifies  a  key-value pair for a resource
                                   tag.

                                   Key -> (string)
                                      A value that specifies the TagKey ,  the
                                      name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique
                                      for the resource to which they  are  at-
                                      tached.

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      A  value  that  specifies the TagValue ,
                                      the value assigned to the  corresponding
                                      tag  key.  Tag  values  can  be null and
                                      don't have to be unique in  a  tag  set.
                                      For  example,  you  can have a key-value
                                      pair in a tag set of  finances  :  April
                                      and also of payroll : April .

                            VolumeId -> (string)
                               The system-generated, unique ID of the volume.

                            VolumeType -> (string)
                               The type of the volume.

                               The configuration of an Amazon FSx for  OpenZFS
                               volume.

                               ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the parent volume.

                               VolumePath -> (string)
                                   The  path  to the volume from the root vol-
                                   ume. For example,  fsx/parentVolume/volume1
                                   .

                               StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                   The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to
                                   reserve from the parent volume.  You  can't
                                   reserve more storage than the parent volume
                                   has reserved.

                               StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                   The maximum amount of storage in  gibibtyes
                                   (GiB) that the volume can use from its par-
                                   ent. You can specify a  quota  larger  than
                                   the storage on the parent volume.

                               RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                   The  record  size  of an OpenZFS volume, in
                                   kibibytes (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8, 16,
                                   32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB. The de-
                                   fault is 128 KiB. Most workloads should use
                                   the  default  record  size. For guidance on
                                   when to set a custom record size,  see  the
                                   Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

                               DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the  method used to compress the
                                   data on the volume. The compression type is
                                   NONE by default.

                                   o NONE  -  Doesn't compress the data on the
                                     volume. NONE is the default.

                                   o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the  volume
                                     using  the  Zstandard  (ZSTD) compression
                                     algorithm. Compared  to  LZ4,  Z-Standard
                                     provides  a  better  compression ratio to
                                     minimize on-disk storage utilization.

                                   o LZ4 - Compresses the data in  the  volume
                                     using the LZ4 compression algorithm. Com-
                                     pared to Z-Standard,  LZ4  is  less  com-
                                     pute-intensive  and delivers higher write
                                     throughput speeds.

                               CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                   A Boolean value indicating whether tags for
                                   the  volume  should be copied to snapshots.
                                   This value defaults to false . If it's  set
                                   to  true  ,  all  tags  for  the volume are
                                   copied to snapshots where the user  doesn't
                                   specify tags. If this value is true and you
                                   specify one or more tags, only  the  speci-
                                   fied  tags  are copied to snapshots. If you
                                   specify one or more tags when creating  the
                                   snapshot,  no tags are copied from the vol-
                                   ume, regardless of this value.

                               OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                   The configuration object that specifies the
                                   snapshot  to  use as the origin of the data
                                   for the volume.

                                   SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a
                                      given  resource.  ARNs uniquely identify
                                      Amazon Web Services  resources.  We  re-
                                      quire  an ARN when you need to specify a
                                      resource  unambiguously  across  all  of
                                      Amazon  Web  Services. For more informa-

                                   CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                      The strategy used when copying data from
                                      the snapshot to the new volume.

                                      o CLONE  - The new volume references the
                                        data in the origin snapshot. Cloning a
                                        snapshot  is  faster  than copying the
                                        data from a snapshot to a  new  volume

                                        However, the origin snapshot can't  be
                                        deleted if there is a volume using its
                                        copied data.

                                      o FULL_COPY - Copies all data  from  the

                        512, or 1024 KiB. The default is 128 KiB.  Most  work-
                        loads should use the default record size. For guidance
                        on when to set a custom record size,  see  the  Amazon
                        FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

                     DataCompressionType -> (string)
                        Specifies  the method used to compress the data on the
                        volume. The compression type is NONE by default.

                        o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the volume. NONE
                          is the default.

                        o ZSTD  -  Compresses the data in the volume using the
                          Zstandard (ZSTD) compression algorithm. Compared  to
                          LZ4,  Z-Standard provides a better compression ratio
                          to minimize on-disk storage utilization.

                        o LZ4 - Compresses the data in the  volume  using  the
                          LZ4  compression  algorithm. Compared to Z-Standard,
                          LZ4 is less compute-intensive  and  delivers  higher
                          write throughput speeds.

                        A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the volume
                        should be copied to snapshots. This value defaults  to
                        false  . If it's set to true , all tags for the volume
                        are copied to snapshots where the user doesn't specify
                        tags.  If  this  value  is true and you specify one or
                        more tags, only the specified tags are copied to snap-
                        shots.  If  you specify one or more tags when creating
                        the snapshot, no tags are copied from the volume,  re-
                        gardless of this value.

                     OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                        The  configuration  object that specifies the snapshot
                        to use as the origin of the data for the volume.

                        SnapshotARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  for  a  given  re-
                            source. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services
                            resources. We require an  ARN  when  you  need  to
                            specify  a  resource  unambiguously  across all of
                            Amazon Web Services.  For  more  information,  see
                            Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs)  in the Amazon Web
                            Services General Reference .

                        CopyStrategy -> (string)
                            The strategy used when copying data from the snap-
                            shot to the new volume.

                            o CLONE  -  The  new volume references the data in
                              the  origin  snapshot.  Cloning  a  snapshot  is
                              faster  than copying the data from a snapshot to
                              a new volume and doesn't consume  disk  through-
                              put.  However,  the  origin  snapshot  can't  be
                              deleted if there is a volume  using  its  copied
                              data.

                            o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the snapshot to
                              the new volume.

                     ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                        A Boolean  value  indicating  whether  the  volume  is
                        read-only.

                     NfsExports -> (list)
                        The  configuration  object for mounting a Network File
                        System (NFS) file system.

                        (structure)
                            The Network File System (NFS)  configurations  for
                            mounting an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.

                            ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                               A  list  of  configuration objects that contain
                               the client and options for mounting the OpenZFS
                               file system.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies  who  can  mount  an OpenZFS file
                                   system  and  the  options  available  while
                                   mounting the file system.

                                   Clients -> (string)
                                      A value that specifies who can mount the
                                      file system. You can provide a  wildcard
                                      character  (*  ), an IP address (0.0.0.0
                                      ), or a CIDR address (192.0.2.0/24 ). By
                                      default,  Amazon  FSx  uses the wildcard
                                      character when specifying the client.

                                   Options -> (list)
                                      The options to  use  when  mounting  the
                                      file  system. For a list of options that
                                      you can use  with  Network  File  System
                                      (NFS),  see  the  exports(5) - Linux man
                                      page . When choosing your options,  con-
                                      sider the following:

                                      o crossmnt  is  used  by default. If you
                                        don't specify crossmnt  when  changing
                                        the client configuration, you won't be
                                        able to see  or  access  snapshots  in
                                        your file system's snapshot directory.

                                      o sync  is  used  by default. If you in-
                                        stead specify async , the  system  ac-
                                        knowledges  writes  before  writing to
                                        disk. If the system crashes before the
                                        writes  are finished, you lose the un-
                                        written data.

                            Describes  the  type  of administrative action, as
                            follows:

                            o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system update admin-
                              istrative  action  initiated from the Amazon FSx
                              console, API (UpdateFileSystem ),  or  CLI  (up-
                              date-file-system ).

                            o THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION  -  After  the FILE_SYS-

                              fully, a  THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION  task  starts.
                              You  can track the storage-optimization progress
                              using   the   ProgressPercent   property.   When
                              THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION  has been completed suc-
                              cessfully, the parent FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action
                              status  changes to COMPLETED . For more informa-

                                the  process of migrating the file system data
                                to newer larger disks.

                              o For Lustre, storage optimization  consists  of
                                rebalancing  the  data across the existing and
                                newly added file servers.

                            You can track  the  storage-optimization  progress
                            using  the  ProgressPercent  property.  When STOR-

                                   The number  of  days  to  retain  automatic
                                   backups.  Setting  this to 0 disables auto-
                                   matic backups.  You  can  retain  automatic
                                   backups for a maximum of 90 days.

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags on
                                   the file system should be copied  to  back-
                                   ups.  This value defaults to false. If it's
                                   set to true, all tags on  the  file  system
                                   are copied to all automatic backups and any
                                   user-initiated  backups  where   the   user
                                   doesn't  specify any tags. If this value is
                                   true, and you specify  one  or  more  tags,
                                   only the specified tags are copied to back-
                                   ups. If you specify one or more  tags  when
                                   creating  a  user-initiated backup, no tags
                                   are copied from the file system, regardless
                                   of this value.

                                   FSx  file  system. Aliases allow you to use
                                   existing DNS names to access  the  data  in
                                   your  Amazon FSx file system. You can asso-
                                   ciate up to 50 aliases with a  file  system
                                   at  any  time. You can associate additional
                                   DNS aliases after you create the file  sys-
                                   tem  using  the  AssociateFileSystemAliases
                                   operation. You can remove DNS aliases  from
                                   the  file  system after it is created using
                                   the  DisassociateFileSystemAliases   opera-
                                   tion.  You  only  need to specify the alias
                                   name in the request payload. For  more  in-

                                      file system. You can use a DNS alias  to
                                      access  a file system using user-defined
                                      DNS names, in addition  to  the  default
                                      DNS  name that Amazon FSx assigns to the
                                      file system. For more  information,  see

                                      S3  durable  data  repository,  if it is
                                      configured with an  S3  repository.  The
                                      lifecycle can have the following values:

                                      o CREATING - The data repository config-
                                        uration between the  FSx  file  system
                                        and  the  linked S3 data repository is
                                        being created. The data repository  is
                                        unavailable.

                                      o AVAILABLE  -  The  data  repository is
                                        available for use.

                                      o MISCONFIGURED - Amazon FSx cannot  au-
                                        tomatically import updates from the S3
                                        bucket until the data repository  con-
                                        figuration  is corrected. For more in-
                                        formation, see Troubleshooting a  Mis-

                                      o UPDATING  - The data repository is un-
                                        dergoing a customer  initiated  update
                                        and availability may be impacted.

                                      o FAILED  -  The data repository is in a
                                        terminal state that cannot  be  recov-
                                        ered.

                                      (and optional prefix) that you're  using
                                      as  the data repository for your FSx for
                                      Lustre file system, for example s3://im-
                                      port-bucket/optional-prefix  . If a pre-
                                      fix is specified  after  the  Amazon  S3
                                      bucket  name, only object keys with that
                                      prefix are loaded into the file system.

                                      For  files  imported from a data reposi-
                                      tory, this value determines  the  stripe
                                      count  and  maximum  amount  of data per
                                      file (in MiB) stored on a single  physi-
                                      cal  disk.  The  maximum number of disks
                                      that a single file can be striped across
                                      is  limited by the total number of disks
                                      that make up the file system.

                                      The default chunk size is 1,024  MiB  (1
                                      GiB)  and  can go as high as 512,000 MiB
                                      (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a max-
                                      imum size of 5 TB.

                                      AutoImportPolicy  configures  how Amazon
                                      FSx keeps your file and directory  list-
                                      ings up to date as you add or modify ob-
                                      jects in your linked S3 bucket.  AutoIm-
                                      portPolicy  can  have the following val-
                                      ues:

                                      o NONE - (Default)  AutoImport  is  off.

                                          A detailed error message.

                               DeploymentType -> (string)
                                   The deployment type of the FSx  for  Lustre
                                   file system. Scratch deployment type is de-
                                   signed   for    temporary    storage    and
                                   shorter-term processing of data.
                                      SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2 deployment types
                                      are best suited for when you need tempo-
                                      rary storage and shorter-term processing
                                      of data. The SCRATCH_2  deployment  type
                                      provides  in-transit  encryption of data
                                      and  higher  burst  throughput  capacity
                                      than SCRATCH_1 .

                                   The  PERSISTENT_1  and PERSISTENT_2 deploy-
                                   ment type is used for  longer-term  storage
                                   and  workloads  and  encryption  of data in
                                   transit.  PERSISTENT_2  offers  higher  Pe-
                                   rUnitStorageThroughput    (up    to    1000
                                   MB/s/TiB) along with a lower minimum  stor-
                                   age  capacity  requirement  (600  GiB).  To

                                   The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                               PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                                   Per unit storage throughput represents  the
                                   megabytes  per  second  of  read  or  write
                                   throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage provi-
                                   sioned.  File system throughput capacity is
                                   equal to Storage capacity (TiB) *  PerUnit-
                                   StorageThroughput  (MB/s/TiB).  This option
                                   is only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and  PERSIS-
                                   TENT_2 deployment types.

                                   Valid values:

                                   o For  PERSISTENT_1  SSD  storage: 50, 100,
                                     200.

                                   o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                                   o For PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage:  125,  250,
                                     500, 1000.

                               MountName -> (string)
                                   You  use  the MountName value when mounting
                                   the file system.

                                   For the  SCRATCH_1  deployment  type,  this
                                   value  is  always  "fsx  ". For SCRATCH_2 ,
                                   PERSISTENT_1 , and PERSISTENT_2  deployment
                                   types,  this  value  is  a  string  that is
                                   unique within an Amazon  Web  Services  Re-
                                   gion.

                               DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                   A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM
                                   . HH is the zero-padded  hour  of  the  day
                                   (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded minute of
                                   the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM
                                   daily.

                               AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                   The  number  of  days  to  retain automatic
                                   backups. Setting this property  to  0  dis-
                                   ables automatic backups. You can retain au-
                                   tomatic backups for a maximum of  90  days.
                                   The default is 30 .

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags on
                                   the file system are copied to  backups.  If
                                   it's set to true, all tags on the file sys-
                                   tem are copied to all automatic backups and
                                   any  user-initiated  backups where the user
                                   doesn't specify any tags. If this value  is
                                   true,  and  you  specify  one or more tags,
                                   only the specified tags are copied to back-
                                   ups.  If  you specify one or more tags when
                                   creating a user-initiated backup,  no  tags
                                   are copied from the file system, regardless
                                   of this value. (Default = false)

                               DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                   The type of drive  cache  used  by  PERSIS-
                                   TENT_1  file  systems  that are provisioned
                                   with HDD storage devices. This parameter is
                                   required  when StorageType is HDD. When set
                                   to READ the file system has an SSD  storage
                                   cache that is sized to 20% of the file sys-
                                   tem's storage capacity. This  improves  the
                                   performance  for  frequently accessed files
                                   by caching up to 20% of the  total  storage
                                   capacity.

                                   This parameter is required when StorageType
                                   is set to HDD.

                               DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                   The data compression configuration for  the
                                   file  system.  DataCompressionType can have
                                   the following values:

                                   o NONE - Data compression is turned off for
                                     the file system.

                                   o LZ4  - Data compression is turned on with
                                     the LZ4 algorithm.

                                   For more information, see Lustre data  com-

                               LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The  Lustre  logging  configuration. Lustre
                                   logging writes the enabled log  events  for
                                   your file system to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                                   Level -> (string)
                                      The  data  repository  events  that  are
                                      logged by Amazon FSx.

                                      o WARN_ONLY - only  warning  events  are
                                        logged.

                                      o ERROR_ONLY  -  only  error  events are
                                        logged.

                                      o WARN_ERROR - both warning  events  and
                                        error events are logged.

                                      o DISABLED  - logging of data repository
                                        events is turned off.

                                      Note that Amazon File Cache uses  a  de-
                                      fault  setting  of  WARN_ERROR  ,  which
                                      can't be changed.

                                   Destination -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that
                                      specifies  the  destination of the logs.
                                      The destination can be any Amazon Cloud-
                                      Watch  Logs  log group ARN. The destina-
                                      tion ARN must be in the same Amazon  Web
                                      Services  partition, Amazon Web Services
                                      Region, and Amazon Web Services  account
                                      as your Amazon FSx file system.

                               RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The Lustre root squash configuration for an
                                   Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. When en-
                                   abled, root squash restricts root-level ac-
                                   cess from clients that try to  access  your
                                   file system as a root user.

                                   RootSquash -> (string)
                                      You enable root squash by setting a user
                                      ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for the file
                                      system  in the format UID:GID (for exam-
                                      ple, 365534:65534 ).  The  UID  and  GID
                                      values can range from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                      o A  non-zero  value for UID and GID en-
                                        ables root squash.  The  UID  and  GID
                                        values can be different, but each must
                                        be a non-zero value.

                                      o A value of 0 (zero) for  UID  and  GID
                                        indicates root, and therefore disables
                                        root squash.

                                      When root squash is enabled, the user ID
                                      and  group  ID  of a root user accessing
                                      the file system are re-mapped to the UID
                                      and GID you provide.

                                   NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                      When root squash is enabled, you can op-
                                      tionally specify an  array  of  NIDs  of
                                      clients  for  which root squash does not
                                      apply. A client NID is a Lustre  Network
                                      Identifier  used  to uniquely identify a
                                      client. You can specify the NID  as  ei-

                                   D:HH:MM .
                                      D is the day of the week,  for  which  1
                                      represents  Monday and 7 represents Sun-
                                      day.  For  further  details,   see   the
                                      ISO-8601  spec as described on Wikipedia
                                      .

                                      HH is the zero-padded hour  of  the  day
                                      (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded minute
                                      of the hour.

                                   machine (SVM) Domain Name System (DNS) name
                                   or  IP  address. You can create a Junction-
                                   Path directly below a parent  volume  junc-
                                   tion  or  on a directory within a volume. A
                                   JunctionPath for a volume named vol3  might
                                   be  /vol1/vol2/vol3  , or /vol1/dir2/vol3 ,
                                   or even /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                               SecurityStyle -> (string)

                                   chine.

                               StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                   A Boolean flag indicating whether this vol-
                                   ume is the root volume for its storage vir-
                                   tual  machine  (SVM). Only one volume on an
                                   SVM can be the root volume. This value  de-
                                   faults  to  false . If this value is true ,
                                   then this is the SVM root volume.

                                   This flag is useful when you're deleting an
                                   SVM,  because  you  must  first  delete all
                                   non-root volumes. This flag,  when  set  to
                                   false , helps you identify which volumes to
                                   delete before you can delete the SVM.

                               TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                                   The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                                      data  in  a  volume must remain inactive
                                      before it is considered "cold" and moved
                                      to the capacity pool. Used with the AUTO
                                      and SNAPSHOT_ONLY tiering policies.  En-
                                      ter  a  whole  number between 2 and 183.
                                      Default values are 31 days for AUTO  and
                                      2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                   Name -> (string)

                                      SHOT_ONLY .

                                      o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snapshots
                                        to the capacity pool storage tier.

                                      o AUTO - moves cold user data and  snap-
                                        shots  to  the  capacity  pool storage
                                        tier based on your access patterns.

                                      o ALL - moves all user  data  blocks  in
                                        both  the active file system and Snap-
                                        shot copies to the storage pool tier.

                                      o NONE - keeps a volume's  data  in  the
                                        primary  storage  tier,  preventing it
                                        from being moved to the capacity  pool
                                        tier.

                               UUID -> (string)

                                   are the following:

                                   o RW  specifies  a read/write volume. RW is
                                     the default.

                                   o DP specifies  a  data-protection  volume.
                                     You can protect data by replicating it to
                                     data-protection mirror copies. If a  dis-
                                     aster occurs, you can use these data-pro-
                                     tection mirror copies to recover data.

                                   o LS specifies a load-sharing  mirror  vol-

                               SnapshotPolicy -> (string)

                                   policies:

                                   o default : This is the default  policy.  A
                                     maximum  of  six  hourly  snapshots taken
                                     five minutes past the hour. A maximum  of
                                     two  daily snapshots taken Monday through
                                     Saturday at 10 minutes after midnight.  A
                                     maximum of two weekly snapshots taken ev-
                                     ery Sunday at 15 minutes after midnight.

                                   o default-1weekly : This policy is the same
                                     as the default policy except that it only
                                     retains  one  snapshot  from  the  weekly
                                     schedule.

                                   o none  :  This  policy  does  not take any
                                     snapshots. This policy can be assigned to
                                     volumes  to  prevent  automatic snapshots
                                     from being taken.

                                   You can also provide the name of  a  custom
                                   policy  that you created with the ONTAP CLI
                                   or REST API.

                               CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                   A boolean flag indicating whether tags  for
                                   the  volume  should  be  copied to backups.
                                   This value defaults to false. If  it's  set
                                   to true, all tags for the volume are copied
                                   to all automatic and user-initiated backups
                                   where  the  user  doesn't  specify tags. If
                                   this value is true, and you specify one  or
                                   more  tags,  only  the  specified  tags are
                                   copied to backups. If you  specify  one  or
                                   more  tags  when  creating a user-initiated
                                   backup, no tags are copied from the volume,
                                   regardless of this value.

                               SnaplockConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The  SnapLock  configuration  object for an
                                   FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                                   AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                                      Enables or disables the audit log volume
                                      for  an  FSx  for ONTAP SnapLock volume.
                                      The default value is false . If you  set
                                      AuditLogVolume  to  true  , the SnapLock
                                      volume is created as an audit  log  vol-
                                      ume. The minimum retention period for an
                                      audit log volume is six months.

                                      The configuration object for setting the
                                      autocommit period of files in an FSx for
                                      ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          Defines the type of time for the au-
                                          tocommit period of a file in an  FSx
                                          for  ONTAP  SnapLock volume. Setting
                                          this value to NONE disables autocom-
                                          mit. The default value is NONE .

                                             one of the valid  types.  If  you
                                             set  it  to  INFINITE , the files
                                             are retained forever. If you  set
                                             it to UNSPECIFIED , the files are
                                             retained until  you  set  an  ex-
                                             plicit retention period.

                                          Value -> (integer)
                                             Defines  the  amount  of time for
                                             the retention period  of  an  FSx
                                             for  ONTAP  SnapLock  volume. You
                                             can't set a value for INFINITE or
                                             UNSPECIFIED  .  For all other op-
                                             tions, the following  ranges  are
                                             valid:

                                             o Seconds : 0 - 65,535

                                             o Minutes : 0 - 65,535

                                   SnaplockType -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  retention mode of an FSx
                                      for ONTAP SnapLock volume. After  it  is
                                      set, it can't be changed. You can choose
                                      one of the following retention modes:

                                      o COMPLIANCE  :  Files  transitioned  to
                                        write once, read many (WORM) on a Com-
                                        pliance volume can't be deleted  until
                                        their  retention  periods expire. This
                                        retention mode is used to address gov-
                                        ernment  or industry-specific mandates
                                        or to protect against  ransomware  at-

                                      o ENTERPRISE  :  Files  transitioned  to
                                        WORM  on  an  Enterprise volume can be
                                        deleted  by  authorized  users  before
                                        their  retention  periods expire using
                                        privileged delete. This retention mode
                                        is  used  to advance an organization's
                                        data integrity and internal compliance
                                        or  to  test retention settings before

                                   VolumeAppendModeEnabled -> (boolean)
                                      Enables  or  disables volume-append mode
                                      on an FSx  for  ONTAP  SnapLock  volume.
                                      Volume-append  mode allows you to create
                                      WORM-appendable files and write data  to
                                      them incrementally. The default value is
                                      false .

                                      For more information, see  Volume-append

                            ResourceARN -> (string)
                               The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given re-
                               source. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web  Ser-
                               vices  resources.  We  require  an ARN when you
                               need to specify a resource unambiguously across
                               all  of  Amazon Web Services. For more informa-

                            Tags -> (list)
                               A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 ele-
                               ments.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies a key-value pair for  a  resource
                                   tag.

                                   Key -> (string)
                                      A  value that specifies the TagKey , the
                                      name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique
                                      for  the  resource to which they are at-
                                      tached.

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      A value that specifies  the  TagValue  ,
                                      the  value assigned to the corresponding
                                      tag key. Tag  values  can  be  null  and
                                      don't  have  to  be unique in a tag set.
                                      For example, you can  have  a  key-value
                                      pair  in  a  tag set of finances : April
                                      and also of payroll : April .

                            VolumeId -> (string)
                               The system-generated, unique ID of the volume.

                            VolumeType -> (string)
                               The type of the volume.

                            LifecycleTransitionReason -> (structure)
                               The reason  why  the  volume  lifecycle  status
                               changed.

                               Message -> (string)
                                   A detailed error message.

                            OpenZFSConfiguration -> (structure)
                               The  configuration of an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS
                               volume.

                               ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the parent volume.

                               VolumePath -> (string)
                                   The path to the volume from the  root  vol-
                                   ume.  For example, fsx/parentVolume/volume1
                                   .

                               StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                   The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to
                                   reserve  from  the parent volume. You can't
                                   reserve more storage than the parent volume
                                   has reserved.

                               StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                   The  maximum amount of storage in gibibtyes
                                   (GiB) that the volume can use from its par-
                                   ent.  You  can  specify a quota larger than
                                   the storage on the parent volume.

                               RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                   The record size of an  OpenZFS  volume,  in
                                   kibibytes (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8, 16,
                                   32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB. The de-
                                   fault is 128 KiB. Most workloads should use
                                   the default record size.  For  guidance  on
                                   when  to  set a custom record size, see the
                                   Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

                               DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                   Specifies the method used to  compress  the
                                   data on the volume. The compression type is
                                   NONE by default.

                                   o NONE - Doesn't compress the data  on  the
                                     volume. NONE is the default.

                                   o ZSTD  - Compresses the data in the volume
                                     using the  Zstandard  (ZSTD)  compression
                                     algorithm.  Compared  to  LZ4, Z-Standard
                                     provides a better  compression  ratio  to
                                     minimize on-disk storage utilization.

                                   o LZ4  -  Compresses the data in the volume
                                     using the LZ4 compression algorithm. Com-
                                     pared  to  Z-Standard,  LZ4  is less com-
                                     pute-intensive and delivers higher  write
                                     throughput speeds.

                               CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                   A Boolean value indicating whether tags for
                                   the volume should be copied  to  snapshots.
                                   This  value defaults to false . If it's set
                                   to true ,  all  tags  for  the  volume  are
                                   copied  to snapshots where the user doesn't
                                   specify tags. If this value is true and you
                                   specify  one  or more tags, only the speci-
                                   fied tags are copied to snapshots.  If  you
                                   specify  one or more tags when creating the
                                   snapshot, no tags are copied from the  vol-
                                   ume, regardless of this value.

                               OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                   The configuration object that specifies the
                                   snapshot to use as the origin of  the  data
                                   for the volume.

                                   SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for a
                                      given resource. ARNs  uniquely  identify
                                      Amazon  Web  Services  resources. We re-
                                      quire an ARN when you need to specify  a
                                      resource  unambiguously  across  all  of
                                      Amazon Web Services. For  more  informa-

                                   CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                      The strategy used when copying data from
                                      the snapshot to the new volume.

                                      o CLONE - The new volume references  the
                                        data in the origin snapshot. Cloning a
                                        snapshot is faster  than  copying  the
                                        data  from  a snapshot to a new volume
                                        and doesn't consume  disk  throughput.
                                        However,  the origin snapshot can't be
                                        deleted if there is a volume using its
                                        copied data.

                                      o FULL_COPY  -  Copies all data from the
