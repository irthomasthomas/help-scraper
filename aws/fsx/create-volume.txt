OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional)  An  idempotency token for resource creation, in a string
          of up to 63 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled  on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --volume-type (string)
          Specifies the type of volume to create; ONTAP and  OPENZFS  are  the
          only valid volume types.

          Possible values:

          o ONTAP

          o OPENZFS

       --name (string)
          Specifies the name of the volume that you're creating.

       --ontap-configuration (structure)
          Specifies the configuration to use when creating the ONTAP volume.

          JunctionPath -> (string)
              Specifies  the  location in the SVM's namespace where the volume
              is mounted. This parameter is required.  The  JunctionPath  must
              have a leading forward slash, such as /vol3 .

          SecurityStyle -> (string)
              Specifies the security style for the volume. If a volume's secu-
              rity style is not specified, it is automatically set to the root
              volume's  security style. The security style determines the type
              of permissions that FSx for ONTAP uses to control  data  access.
              For  more  information,  see Volume security style in the Amazon
              FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide . Specify one of  the  following
              values:

              o UNIX  if  the  file system is managed by a UNIX administrator,
                the majority of users are NFS clients, and an application  ac-
                cessing the data uses a UNIX user as the service account.

              o NTFS if the file system is managed by a Windows administrator,
                the majority of users are SMB clients, and an application  ac-
                cessing the data uses a Windows user as the service account.

              o MIXED  if  the file system is managed by both UNIX and Windows
                administrators and users consist of both NFS and SMB clients.

          SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
              Specifies the size of the volume, in megabytes  (MB),  that  you
              are creating.

          StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
              Set to true to enable deduplication, compression, and compaction
              storage efficiency features on the volume, or set  to  false  to
              disable them. This parameter is required.

          StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
              Specifies the ONTAP SVM in which to create the volume.

          TieringPolicy -> (structure)
              Describes  the data tiering policy for an ONTAP volume. When en-
              abled, Amazon FSx for ONTAP's intelligent tiering  automatically
              transitions  a  volume's  data between the file system's primary
              storage and capacity pool storage based on your access patterns.

              Valid tiering policies are the following:

              o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - (Default value) moves cold  snapshots  to  the
                capacity pool storage tier.

              o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots to the capacity pool
                storage tier based on your access patterns.

              o ALL - moves all user data blocks in both the active file  sys-
                tem and Snapshot copies to the storage pool tier.

              o NONE - keeps a volume's data in the primary storage tier, pre-
                venting it from being moved to the capacity pool tier.

              CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                 Specifies the number of days that user data in a volume  must
                 remain  inactive  before it is considered "cold" and moved to
                 the capacity pool. Used with the AUTO and SNAPSHOT_ONLY tier-
                 ing policies. Enter a whole number between 2 and 183. Default
                 values are 31 days for AUTO and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

              Name -> (string)
                 Specifies the tiering policy used to transition data. Default
                 value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                 o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snapshots to the capacity pool
                   storage tier.

                 o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots to  the  capacity
                   pool storage tier based on your access patterns.

                 o ALL  -  moves  all user data blocks in both the active file
                   system and Snapshot copies to the storage pool tier.

                 o NONE - keeps a volume's data in the primary  storage  tier,
                   preventing it from being moved to the capacity pool tier.

          OntapVolumeType -> (string)
              Specifies  the type of volume you are creating. Valid values are
              the following:

              o RW specifies a read/write volume. RW is the default.

              o DP  specifies  a  data-protection  volume.  A  DP  volume   is
                read-only and can be used as the destination of a NetApp Snap-
                Mirror relationship.

              For more information, see Volume types in the Amazon FSx for Ne-
              tApp ONTAP User Guide .

          SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
              Specifies  the  snapshot  policy for the volume. There are three
              built-in snapshot policies:

              o default : This is the default policy. A maximum of six  hourly
                snapshots  taken  five minutes past the hour. A maximum of two
                daily snapshots taken Monday through Saturday  at  10  minutes
                after  midnight. A maximum of two weekly snapshots taken every
                Sunday at 15 minutes after midnight.

              o default-1weekly : This policy is the same as the default  pol-
                icy  except  that it only retains one snapshot from the weekly
                schedule.

              o none : This policy does not take any  snapshots.  This  policy
                can be assigned to volumes to prevent automatic snapshots from
                being taken.

              You can also provide the name of a custom policy that  you  cre-
              ated with the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

              For  more  information,  see Snapshot policies in the Amazon FSx
              for NetApp ONTAP User Guide .

          CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
              A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the volume should  be
              copied  to backups. This value defaults to false. If it's set to
              true, all tags for the volume are copied to  all  automatic  and
              user-initiated  backups  where the user doesn't specify tags. If
              this value is true, and you specify one or more tags,  only  the
              specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more
              tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags  are  copied
              from the volume, regardless of this value.

          SnaplockConfiguration -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  SnapLock configuration for an FSx for ONTAP vol-
              ume.

              AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                 Enables or disables the audit log volume for an FSx for ONTAP
                 SnapLock  volume. The default value is false . If you set Au-
                 ditLogVolume to true , the SnapLock volume is created  as  an
                 audit  log  volume. The minimum retention period for an audit
                 log volume is six months.

                 For more information, see SnapLock audit log volumes .

              AutocommitPeriod -> (structure)
                 The configuration object for setting the autocommit period of
                 files in an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                 Type -> (string)
                     Defines  the  type of time for the autocommit period of a
                     file in an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock  volume.  Setting  this
                     value  to  NONE disables autocommit. The default value is
                     NONE .

                 Value -> (integer)
                     Defines the amount of time for the autocommit period of a
                     file  in  an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume. The following
                     ranges are valid:

                     o Minutes : 5 - 65,535

                     o Hours : 1 - 65,535

                     o Days : 1 - 3,650

                     o Months : 1 - 120

                     o Years : 1 - 10

              PrivilegedDelete -> (string)
                 Enables, disables, or permanently disables privileged  delete
                 on  an  FSx  for  ONTAP  SnapLock Enterprise volume. Enabling
                 privileged delete allows SnapLock  administrators  to  delete
                 WORM files even if they have active retention periods. PERMA-
                 NENTLY_DISABLED is a terminal state. If privileged delete  is
                 permanently  disabled  on a SnapLock volume, you can't re-en-
                 able it. The default value is DISABLED .

                 For more information, see Privileged delete .

              RetentionPeriod -> (structure)
                 Specifies the retention period of an FSx for  ONTAP  SnapLock
                 volume.

                 DefaultRetention -> (structure)
                     The  retention period assigned to a write once, read many
                     (WORM) file by default if an explicit retention period is
                     not set for an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume. The default
                     retention period must be greater than  or  equal  to  the
                     minimum  retention  period  and less than or equal to the
                     maximum retention period.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Defines the type of time for the retention  period  of
                        an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume. Set it to one of the
                        valid types. If you set it to INFINITE , the files are
                        retained  forever.  If you set it to UNSPECIFIED , the
                        files are retained until you set an explicit retention
                        period.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines the amount of time for the retention period of
                        an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock  volume.  You  can't  set  a
                        value  for INFINITE or UNSPECIFIED . For all other op-
                        tions, the following ranges are valid:

                        o Seconds : 0 - 65,535

                        o Minutes : 0 - 65,535

                        an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume. Set it to one of the
                        valid types. If you set it to INFINITE , the files are
                        retained forever. If you set it to UNSPECIFIED  ,  the
                        files are retained until you set an explicit retention
                        period.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines the amount of time for the retention period of

                 MaximumRetention -> (structure)
                     The  longest  retention  period that can be assigned to a
                     WORM file on an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Defines the type of time for the retention  period  of
                        an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume. Set it to one of the
                        valid types. If you set it to INFINITE , the files are
                        retained  forever.  If you set it to UNSPECIFIED , the
                        files are retained until you set an explicit retention
                        period.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines the amount of time for the retention period of
                        an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock  volume.  You  can't  set  a

              SnaplockType -> (string)
                 Specifies the retention mode of an  FSx  for  ONTAP  SnapLock
                 volume.  After it is set, it can't be changed. You can choose
                 one of the following retention modes:

                 o COMPLIANCE : Files transitioned to write  once,  read  many
                   (WORM)  on a Compliance volume can't be deleted until their
                   retention periods expire. This retention mode  is  used  to
                   address government or industry-specific mandates or to pro-
                   tect against ransomware attacks. For more information,  see
                   SnapLock Compliance .

                 o ENTERPRISE  :  Files  transitioned to WORM on an Enterprise
                   volume can be deleted by authorized users before their  re-
                   tention periods expire using privileged delete. This reten-
                   tion mode is used to advance an organization's data  integ-
                   rity  and internal compliance or to test retention settings
                   before using SnapLock Compliance. For more information, see
                   SnapLock Enterprise .

              VolumeAppendModeEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Enables  or  disables  volume-append mode on an FSx for ONTAP
                 SnapLock volume. Volume-append  mode  allows  you  to  create
                 WORM-appendable  files  and write data to them incrementally.
                 The default value is false .

                 For more information, see Volume-append mode .

          VolumeStyle -> (string)
              Use to specify the style of an ONTAP volume. For  more  informa-
              tion  about  FlexVols and FlexGroups, see Volume types in Amazon
              FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide.

          AggregateConfiguration -> (structure)

              gregate or aggregates.

              Aggregates -> (list)
                 Used  to  specify the names of aggregates on which the volume
                 will be created.

                 (string)

              ConstituentsPerAggregate -> (integer)
                 Used to explicitly set the number of constituents within  the
                 FlexGroup  per storage aggregate. This field is optional when
                 creating a FlexGroup  volume.  If  unspecified,  the  default
                 value  will be 8. This field cannot be provided when creating
                 a FlexVol volume.

          SizeInBytes -> (long)
              The configured size of the volume, in bytes.

       --tags (list)
          A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag.  Tag
                 keys  must  be  unique for the resource to which they are at-
                 tached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A value that specifies the TagValue , the value  assigned  to
                 the  corresponding  tag key. Tag values can be null and don't
                 have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can  have  a
                 key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances : April and also of
                 payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

            ...
          ]

       --open-zfs-configuration (structure)
          Specifies the configuration to use when creating the OpenZFS volume.

          ParentVolumeId -> (string)
              The ID of the volume to use as the parent volume of  the  volume
              that you are creating.

          StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  amount  of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to reserve
              from the parent  volume.  Setting  StorageCapacityReservationGiB
              guarantees  that  the  specified  amount of storage space on the
              parent volume will always be available for the volume. You can't
              reserve  more storage than the parent volume has. To not specify
              a storage capacity reservation, set this to 0 or -1 .  For  more
              information, see Volume properties in the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS
              User Guide .

          StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
              Sets the maximum storage size in gibibytes (GiB) for the volume.
              You  can  specify a quota that is larger than the storage on the
              parent volume. A volume quota limits the amount of storage  that
              the  volume  can  consume to the configured amount, but does not
              guarantee the space will be available on the parent  volume.  To
              guarantee quota space, you must also set StorageCapacityReserva-
              tionGiB . To not specify a storage capacity quota, set  this  to
              -1 .

              For  more  information,  see Volume properties in the Amazon FSx
              for OpenZFS User Guide .

          RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
              Specifies the suggested  block  size  for  a  volume  in  a  ZFS
              dataset,  in kibibytes (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,
              128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB. The default is 128 KiB. We recommend
              using  the default setting for the majority of use cases. Gener-
              ally, workloads that write in fixed small or large record  sizes
              may  benefit  from  setting  a custom record size, like database
              workloads (small  record  size)  or  media  streaming  workloads
              (large  record  size).  For additional guidance on when to set a
              custom record size, see ZFS Record size in the  Amazon  FSx  for
              OpenZFS User Guide .

          DataCompressionType -> (string)
              Specifies  the  method  used to compress the data on the volume.
              The compression type is NONE by default.

              o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the volume.  NONE  is  the
                default.

              o ZSTD  -  Compresses the data in the volume using the Zstandard
                (ZSTD) compression  algorithm.  ZSTD  compression  provides  a
                higher  level  of  data compression and higher read throughput
                performance than LZ4 compression.

              o LZ4 - Compresses the data in the volume using the LZ4 compres-
                sion algorithm. LZ4 compression provides a lower level of com-
                pression and higher write  throughput  performance  than  ZSTD
                compression.

              For more information about volume compression types and the per-
              formance of your Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file  system,  see  Tips
              for  maximizing  performance  File system and volume settings in
              the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

          CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the volume should be
              copied  to snapshots. This value defaults to false . If it's set
              to true , all tags for the volume are copied to snapshots  where
              the  user  doesn't specify tags. If this value is true , and you
              specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied  to
              snapshots.  If  you  specify  one or more tags when creating the
              snapshot, no tags are copied from the volume, regardless of this
              value.

          OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
              The  configuration  object that specifies the snapshot to use as
              the origin of the data for the volume.

              SnapshotARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  a  given  resource.  ARNs
                 uniquely  identify  Amazon Web Services resources. We require
                 an ARN when you need  to  specify  a  resource  unambiguously
                 across  all of Amazon Web Services. For more information, see
                 Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services  Gen-
                 eral Reference .

              CopyStrategy -> (string)
                 Specifies  the strategy used when copying data from the snap-
                 shot to the new volume.

                 o CLONE - The new volume references the data  in  the  origin
                   snapshot.  Cloning  a  snapshot is faster than copying data
                   from the snapshot to a new volume and doesn't consume  disk
                   throughput.  However,  the origin snapshot can't be deleted
                   if there is a volume using its copied data.

                 o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the snapshot  to  the  new
                   volume.  Specify  this  option  to create the volume from a
                   snapshot on another FSx for OpenZFS file system.

                 NOTE:
                     The INCREMENTAL_COPY option is only for updating  an  ex-
                     isting  volume  by  using a snapshot from another FSx for
                     OpenZFS  file   system.   For   more   information,   see
                     CopySnapshotAndUpdateVolume .

          ReadOnly -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value indicating whether the volume is read-only.

          NfsExports -> (list)
              The  configuration  object  for  mounting  a Network File System
              (NFS) file system.

              (structure)
                 The Network File System (NFS) configurations for mounting  an
                 Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.

                 ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                     A  list  of configuration objects that contain the client
                     and options for mounting the OpenZFS file system.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies who can mount an OpenZFS file system and the
                        options available while mounting the file system.

                        Clients -> (string)
                            A value that specifies who can mount the file sys-
                            tem. You can provide a wildcard character (* ), an
                            IP   address   (0.0.0.0   ),  or  a  CIDR  address
                            (192.0.2.0/24 ). By default, Amazon FSx  uses  the
                            wildcard character when specifying the client.

                        Options -> (list)
                            The  options to use when mounting the file system.
                            For a list of options that you can use  with  Net-
                            work File System (NFS), see the exports(5) - Linux
                            man page . When choosing  your  options,  consider
                            the following:

                            o crossmnt  is used by default. If you don't spec-
                              ify crossmnt when changing the client configura-
                              tion,  you  won't be able to see or access snap-
                              shots in your file system's snapshot directory.

                            o sync is used by default. If you instead  specify
                              async  ,  the  system acknowledges writes before
                              writing to disk. If the  system  crashes  before
                              the  writes are finished, you lose the unwritten
                              data.

                            (string)

          UserAndGroupQuotas -> (list)
              An object specifying how much storage users or groups can use on
              the volume.

              (structure)
                 The  configuration  for  how much storage a user or group can
                 use on the volume.

                 Type -> (string)
                     A value that specifies whether the  quota  applies  to  a
                     user or group.

                 Id -> (integer)
                     The ID of the user or group.

                 StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                     The  amount  of storage that the user or group can use in
                     gibibytes (GiB).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 dress.  You can create a JunctionPath directly below a parent
                 volume junction or on a directory within a  volume.  A  Junc-
                 tionPath  for  a volume named vol3 might be /vol1/vol2/vol3 ,
                 or /vol1/dir2/vol3 , or even /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

              SecurityStyle -> (string)
                 The security style for the volume, which can be UNIX , NTFS ,
                 or MIXED .

              SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                 The configured size of the volume, in megabytes (MBs).

              StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                 The volume's storage efficiency setting.

              StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                 The ID of the volume's storage virtual machine.

              StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                 A  Boolean  flag  indicating  whether this volume is the root
                 volume for its storage virtual machine (SVM). Only one volume
                 on  an  SVM  can  be  the root volume. This value defaults to
                 false . If this value is true , then this  is  the  SVM  root
                 volume.

                 This  flag is useful when you're deleting an SVM, because you
                 must first delete all non-root volumes. This flag,  when  set
                 to  false , helps you identify which volumes to delete before
                 you can delete the SVM.

              TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                 The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                 CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                     Specifies the number of days that user data in  a  volume
                     must  remain  inactive before it is considered "cold" and
                     moved to the capacity pool. Used with the AUTO and  SNAP-
                     SHOT_ONLY  tiering policies. Enter a whole number between
                     2 and 183. Default values are 31 days for AUTO and 2 days
                     for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                 Name -> (string)
                     Specifies the tiering policy used to transition data. De-
                     fault value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                     o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold snapshots  to  the  capacity
                       pool storage tier.

                     o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots to the capac-
                       ity pool storage tier based on your access patterns.

                     o ALL - moves all user data blocks  in  both  the  active
                       file  system  and  Snapshot  copies to the storage pool
                       tier.

                     o NONE - keeps a volume's data  in  the  primary  storage
                       tier,  preventing  it  from being moved to the capacity
                       pool tier.

              UUID -> (string)
                 The volume's universally unique identifier (UUID).

              OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of volume. Valid values are the following:

                 o RW specifies a read/write volume. RW is the default.

                 o DP specifies a data-protection volume. You can protect data
                   by  replicating  it  to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                   disaster occurs, you can use these  data-protection  mirror
                   copies to recover data.

                 o LS  specifies  a load-sharing mirror volume. A load-sharing
                   mirror reduces the network traffic to a FlexVol  volume  by
                   providing additional read-only access to clients.

              SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                 Specifies the snapshot policy for the volume. There are three
                 built-in snapshot policies:

                 o default : This is the default  policy.  A  maximum  of  six
                   hourly  snapshots taken five minutes past the hour. A maxi-
                   mum of two daily snapshots taken Monday through Saturday at
                   10  minutes  after  midnight. A maximum of two weekly snap-
                   shots taken every Sunday at 15 minutes after midnight.

                 o default-1weekly : This policy is the same  as  the  default
                   policy  except  that  it only retains one snapshot from the
                   weekly schedule.

                 o none : This policy does not take any snapshots. This policy
                   can  be  assigned to volumes to prevent automatic snapshots
                   from being taken.

                 You can also provide the name of a  custom  policy  that  you
                 created with the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                 For more information, see Snapshot policies in the Amazon FSx
                 for NetApp ONTAP User Guide.

              CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                 A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the volume  should
                 be  copied  to backups. This value defaults to false. If it's
                 set to true, all tags for the volume are copied to all  auto-
                 matic and user-initiated backups where the user doesn't spec-
                 ify tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or  more
                 tags,  only  the specified tags are copied to backups. If you
                 specify one or  more  tags  when  creating  a  user-initiated
                 backup,  no  tags  are  copied from the volume, regardless of
                 this value.

              SnaplockConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The SnapLock  configuration  object  for  an  FSx  for  ONTAP
                 SnapLock volume.

                 AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                     Enables  or  disables the audit log volume for an FSx for
                     ONTAP SnapLock volume. The default value is  false  .  If
                     you  set  AuditLogVolume to true , the SnapLock volume is
                     created as an audit log volume. The minimum retention pe-
                     riod for an audit log volume is six months.

                     For more information, see SnapLock audit log volumes .

                 AutocommitPeriod -> (structure)
                     The  configuration  object for setting the autocommit pe-
                     riod of files in an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Defines the type of time for the autocommit period  of
                        a  file  in  an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume. Setting
                        this value to NONE disables  autocommit.  The  default
                        value is NONE .

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines  the  amount of time for the autocommit period
                        of a file in an FSx for  ONTAP  SnapLock  volume.  The
                        following ranges are valid:

                        o Minutes : 5 - 65,535

                        o Hours : 1 - 65,535

                        o Days : 1 - 3,650

                        o Months : 1 - 120

                        o Years : 1 - 10

                 PrivilegedDelete -> (string)
                     Enables,  disables,  or  permanently  disables privileged
                     delete on an FSx for ONTAP  SnapLock  Enterprise  volume.
                     Enabling privileged delete allows SnapLock administrators
                     to delete write once, read many (WORM) files even if they
                     have  active retention periods. PERMANENTLY_DISABLED is a
                     terminal state. If privileged delete is permanently  dis-
                     abled  on  a SnapLock volume, you can't re-enable it. The
                     default value is DISABLED .

                     For more information, see Privileged delete .

                 RetentionPeriod -> (structure)
                     Specifies the  retention  period  of  an  FSx  for  ONTAP
                     SnapLock volume.

                     DefaultRetention -> (structure)
                        The  retention  period  assigned to a write once, read
                        many (WORM) file by default if an  explicit  retention
                        period  is  not set for an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock vol-
                        ume. The default retention period must be greater than
                        or equal to the minimum retention period and less than
                        or equal to the maximum retention period.

                        Type -> (string)
                            Defines the type of time for the retention  period
                            of an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume. Set it to one
                            of the valid types. If you set it  to  INFINITE  ,
                            the  files  are retained forever. If you set it to
                            UNSPECIFIED , the files are retained until you set
                            an explicit retention period.

                        Value -> (integer)
                            Defines  the  amount of time for the retention pe-
                            riod of an FSx  for  ONTAP  SnapLock  volume.  You
                            can't  set  a  value for INFINITE or UNSPECIFIED .
                            For all other options, the  following  ranges  are
                            valid:

                            o Seconds : 0 - 65,535

                            o Minutes : 0 - 65,535

                     MinimumRetention -> (structure)
                        The  shortest retention period that can be assigned to
                        a WORM file on an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                        Type -> (string)
                            Defines the type of time for the retention  period
                            of an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume. Set it to one
                            of the valid types. If you set it  to  INFINITE  ,
                            the  files  are retained forever. If you set it to

                 SnaplockType -> (string)
                     Specifies the retention mode of an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock
                     volume. After it is set, it can't  be  changed.  You  can
                     choose one of the following retention modes:

                     o COMPLIANCE  :  Files  transitioned  to write once, read
                       many (WORM) on a Compliance volume can't be deleted un-
                       til their retention periods expire. This retention mode
                       is used to address government or industry-specific man-
                       dates  or  to  protect  against ransomware attacks. For
                       more information, see SnapLock Compliance .

                     o ENTERPRISE : Files transitioned to WORM  on  an  Enter-
                       prise  volume can be deleted by authorized users before
                       their retention periods expire using privileged delete.
                       This  retention  mode  is  used to advance an organiza-
                       tion's data integrity and  internal  compliance  or  to
                       test  retention  settings before using SnapLock Compli-
                       ance. For more information, see SnapLock Enterprise .

                 VolumeAppendModeEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Enables or disables volume-append mode on an FSx for  ON-
                     TAP  SnapLock  volume.  Volume-append  mode allows you to
                     create WORM-appendable files and write data to  them  in-
                     crementally. The default value is false .

                     For more information, see Volume-append mode .

              VolumeStyle -> (string)
                 Use  to specify the style of an ONTAP volume. For more infor-
                 mation about FlexVols and FlexGroups,  see  Volume  types  in
                 Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide.

              AggregateConfiguration -> (structure)
                 This  structure specifies configuration options for a volumes
                 storage aggregate or aggregates.

                 Aggregates -> (list)
                     The list of aggregates that this volume resides  on.  Ag-
                     gregates  are  storage  pools  which make up your primary
                     storage tier. Each high-availability (HA)  pair  has  one
                     aggregate.  The  names of the aggregates map to the names
                     of the aggregates in the ONTAP  CLI  and  REST  API.  For
                     FlexVols, there will always be a single entry.

                     Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Re-
                     quest) for the following conditions:

                     o The strings in the value of Aggregates are not are  not
                       formatted  as aggrX , where X is a number between 1 and
                       6.

                     o The value of Aggregates contains  aggregates  that  are

                       task starts.

                       o For  Windows  and  ONTAP, storage optimization is the
                         process of migrating the file system  data  to  newer
                         larger disks.

                       o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists of rebal-
                         ancing the data across the existing and  newly  added
                         file servers.

                     You can track the storage-optimization progress using the
                     ProgressPercent property. When  STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  has
                     been  completed  successfully, the parent FILE_SYSTEM_UP-
                     DATE action status changes to COMPLETED . For more infor-

                        Specifies the IDs of the subnets that the file  system
                        is accessible from. For the Amazon FSx Windows and ON-
                        TAP MULTI_AZ_1 file system deployment type, there  are
                        two  subnet IDs, one for the preferred file server and
                        one for the standby file server.  The  preferred  file
                        server  subnet  identified  in  the  PreferredSubnetID
                        property. All other file systems have only one  subnet
                        ID.

                        For FSx for Lustre file systems, and Single-AZ Windows
                        file systems, this is the ID of the subnet  that  con-
                        tains  the file system's endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1 Win-
                        dows and ONTAP file systems, the file system  endpoint
                        is available in the PreferredSubnetID .

                        (string)

                        The IDs of the elastic network interfaces from which a
                        specific  file  system is accessible. The elastic net-
                        work interface is automatically created  in  the  same
                        virtual  private  cloud (VPC) that the Amazon FSx file
                        system was  created  in.  For  more  information,  see

                        Guide.

                        For an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system,
                        you  can  have one network interface ID. For an Amazon
                        FSx for Lustre file system, you  can  have  more  than
                        one.

                        (string)
                            An  elastic  network interface ID. An elastic net-
                            work interface is a logical  networking  component

                            on  Linux  SMB clients or Windows SMB clients that
                            are not joined to a  Microsoft  Active  Directory.
                            Applicable  for all Windows file system deployment
                            types. This IP address is temporarily  unavailable
                            when  the  file  system is undergoing maintenance.
                            For Linux and Windows SMB clients that are  joined
                            to  an  Active  Directory,  use  the file system's
                            DNSName instead. For more information  on  mapping
                            and  mounting  file  shares,  see  Accessing  File

                            system should be copied to backups. This value de-
                            faults to false. If it's set to true, all tags  on
                            the  file system are copied to all automatic back-
                            ups and any user-initiated backups where the  user
                            doesn't  specify  any tags. If this value is true,
                            and you specify one or more tags, only the  speci-
                            fied  tags  are  copied to backups. If you specify
                            one or more tags when  creating  a  user-initiated
                            backup,  no  tags are copied from the file system,
                            regardless of this value.

                        Aliases -> (list)
                            An array of one or more DNS aliases that are  cur-
                            rently associated with the Amazon FSx file system.
                            Aliases allow you to use existing DNS names to ac-
                            cess  the data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                            can associate up to 50 aliases with a file  system
                            at  any  time.  You  can  associate additional DNS
                            aliases after you create the file system using the
                            AssociateFileSystemAliases  operation. You can re-
                            move DNS aliases from the file system after it  is
                            created  using  the  DisassociateFileSystemAliases
                            operation. You only need to specify the alias name
                            in  the request payload. For more information, see

                               system.  You  can  use  a DNS alias to access a
                               file system using user-defined  DNS  names,  in
                               addition  to  the  default DNS name that Amazon
                               FSx assigns to the file system. For more infor-

                                     with an Amazon FSx file system.

                                   o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS
                                     alias and associating it  with  the  file
                                     system.

                                   o CREATE_FAILED  - Amazon FSx was unable to
                                     associate the DNS  alias  with  the  file
                                     system.

                                   o DELETING  -  Amazon FSx is disassociating
                                     the DNS alias from the  file  system  and

                               tion  of the audit logs. The destination can be
                               any Amazon CloudWatch Logs  log  group  ARN  or
                               Amazon  Kinesis  Data  Firehose delivery stream
                               ARN.

                               The name of  the  Amazon  CloudWatch  Logs  log
                               group  must begin with the /aws/fsx prefix. The
                               name of the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose deliv-
                               ery stream must begin with the aws-fsx prefix.

                               The destination ARN (either CloudWatch Logs log
                               group or Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream)
                               must  be in the same Amazon Web Services parti-
                               tion, Amazon Web Services  Region,  and  Amazon

                               system.

                        DiskIopsConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The SSD IOPS (input/output operations per  second)
                            configuration  for  an Amazon FSx for Windows file
                            system. By default, Amazon FSx automatically  pro-
                            visions  3  IOPS  per GiB of storage capacity. You
                            can provision additional IOPS per GiB of  storage,
                            up  to the maximum limit associated with your cho-
                            sen throughput capacity.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               Specifies whether the file system is using  the
                               AUTOMATIC  setting of SSD IOPS of 3 IOPS per GB
                               of  storage  capacity,  ,  or  if  it  using  a
                               USER_PROVISIONED value.

                            Iops -> (long)
                               The  total  number  of SSD IOPS provisioned for
                               the file system.

                               The minimum and maximum values for  this  prop-
                               erty  depend  on the value of HAPairs and Stor-
                               ageCapacity . The minimum value  is  calculated
                               as StorageCapacity * 3 * HAPairs (3 IOPS per GB
                               of StorageCapacity ). The maximum value is cal-
                               culated as 200,000 * HAPairs .

                               Amazon  FSx  responds  with an HTTP status code
                               400 (Bad Request) if the value of Iops is  out-
                               side of the minimum or maximum values.

                     LustreConfiguration -> (structure)

                            with a data repository association. For file  sys-
                            tems with a data repository association, see .

                            Lifecycle -> (string)
                               Describes  the  state  of  the file system's S3
                               durable data repository, if  it  is  configured
                               with  an  S3 repository. The lifecycle can have
                               the following values:

                               o CREATING - The data repository  configuration
                                 between the FSx file system and the linked S3
                                 data repository is being  created.  The  data
                                 repository is unavailable.

                               o AVAILABLE  - The data repository is available
                                 for use.

                               o MISCONFIGURED - Amazon FSx  cannot  automati-
                                 cally import updates from the S3 bucket until
                                 the data  repository  configuration  is  cor-
                                 rected.    For    more    information,    see

                                 bucket .

                               o UPDATING  - The data repository is undergoing
                                 a customer initiated update and  availability
                                 may be impacted.

                               o FAILED - The data repository is in a terminal
                                 state that cannot be recovered.

                            ImportPath -> (string)

                               optional  prefix) that you're using as the data
                               repository for your FSx for Lustre file system,
                               for  example s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix
                               . If a prefix is specified after the Amazon  S3
                               bucket  name, only object keys with that prefix
                               are loaded into the file system.

                            ExportPath -> (string)
                               The export path to the Amazon  S3  bucket  (and
                               prefix)  that  you  are  using to store new and
                               changed Lustre file system files in S3.

                            ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                               For files imported from a data repository, this
                               value  determines  the stripe count and maximum
                               amount of data per file (in MiB)  stored  on  a
                               single  physical  disk.  The  maximum number of
                               disks that a single file can be striped  across
                               is  limited  by  the total number of disks that
                               make up the file system.

                               The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and
                               can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon
                               S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                            AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                               Describes the  file  system's  linked  S3  data
                               repository's AutoImportPolicy . The AutoImport-
                               Policy configures how  Amazon  FSx  keeps  your
                               file  and  directory listings up to date as you
                               add or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket.
                               AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

                               o NONE  -  (Default)  AutoImport is off. Amazon
                                 FSx only updates file and directory  listings
                                 from  the linked S3 bucket when the file sys-
                                 tem is created. FSx does not update file  and
                                 directory listings for any new or changed ob-
                                 jects after choosing this option.

                               o NEW - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx  automati-
                                 cally  imports  directory listings of any new
                                 objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do
                                 not currently exist in the FSx file system.

                               o NEW_CHANGED  -  AutoImport  is on. Amazon FSx
                                 automatically  imports  file  and   directory
                                 listings  of  any new objects added to the S3
                                 bucket and  any  existing  objects  that  are
                                 changed  in  the  S3  bucket after you choose
                                 this option.

                               o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED - AutoImport is on.  Ama-
                                 zon FSx automatically imports file and direc-
                                 tory listings of any new objects added to the
                                 S3  bucket,  any  existing  objects  that are
                                 changed in the S3  bucket,  and  any  objects
                                 that were deleted in the S3 bucket.

                            FailureDetails -> (structure)
                               Provides  detailed  information  about the data
                               repository if its Lifecycle is set  to  MISCON-
                               FIGURED or FAILED .

                               Message -> (string)
                                   A detailed error message.

                        DeploymentType -> (string)
                            The  deployment  type  of  the FSx for Lustre file
                            system. Scratch deployment type  is  designed  for
                            temporary  storage  and shorter-term processing of
                            data.
                               SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2  deployment  types  are
                               best suited for when you need temporary storage
                               and  shorter-term  processing  of   data.   The
                               SCRATCH_2  deployment  type provides in-transit
                               encryption of data and higher burst  throughput
                               capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

                            The  PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment type
                            is used for longer-term storage and workloads  and
                            encryption of data in transit. PERSISTENT_2 offers
                            higher  PerUnitStorageThroughput   (up   to   1000
                            MB/s/TiB)  along  with a lower minimum storage ca-
                            pacity requirement (600 GiB). To learn more  about
                            FSx  for Lustre deployment types, see FSx for Lus-
                            tre deployment options .

                            The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                        PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                            Per  unit  storage   throughput   represents   the
                            megabytes  per  second of read or write throughput
                            per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File system
                            throughput  capacity  is equal to Storage capacity
                            (TiB) * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB).  This
                            option  is only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSIS-
                            TENT_2 deployment types.

                            Valid values:

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                              1000.

                        MountName -> (string)
                            You use the MountName value when mounting the file
                            system.

                            For the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this  value  is
                            always  "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 , and
                            PERSISTENT_2 deployment types,  this  value  is  a
                            string  that  is  unique within an Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices Region.

                        DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                            A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM  .  HH
                            is  the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM
                            is the zero-padded minute of the hour.  For  exam-
                            ple, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                        AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  days to retain automatic backups.
                            Setting this  property  to  0  disables  automatic
                            backups.  You  can  retain automatic backups for a
                            maximum of 90 days. The default is 30 .

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file
                            system are copied to backups. If it's set to true,
                            all tags on the file system are copied to all  au-
                            tomatic  backups  and  any  user-initiated backups
                            where the user doesn't specify any tags.  If  this
                            value  is  true, and you specify one or more tags,
                            only the specified tags are copied to backups.  If
                            you  specify  one  or  more  tags  when creating a
                            user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the
                            file  system, regardless of this value. (Default =
                            false)

                        DriveCacheType -> (string)
                            The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1  file
                            systems  that are provisioned with HDD storage de-
                            vices. This parameter is required when StorageType
                            is  HDD.  When  set to READ the file system has an
                            SSD storage cache that is sized to 20% of the file
                            system's  storage capacity. This improves the per-
                            formance for frequently accessed files by  caching
                            up to 20% of the total storage capacity.

                            This parameter is required when StorageType is set
                            to HDD.

                        DataCompressionType -> (string)
                            The data compression configuration  for  the  file
                            system. DataCompressionType can have the following
                            values:

                            o NONE - Data compression is turned  off  for  the
                              file system.

                            o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4
                              algorithm.

                            For more information, see Lustre data  compression
                            .

                        LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The  Lustre  logging configuration. Lustre logging
                            writes the enabled log events for your file system
                            to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                            Level -> (string)
                               The  data  repository events that are logged by
                               Amazon FSx.

                               o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                               o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                               o WARN_ERROR - both warning  events  and  error
                                 events are logged.

                               o DISABLED  - logging of data repository events
                                 is turned off.

                               Note that Amazon File Cache uses a default set-
                               ting of WARN_ERROR , which can't be changed.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that specifies
                               the destination of the  logs.  The  destination
                               can  be  any  Amazon  CloudWatch Logs log group
                               ARN. The destination ARN must be  in  the  same
                               Amazon  Web Services partition, Amazon Web Ser-
                               vices Region, and Amazon Web  Services  account
                               as your Amazon FSx file system.

                        RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The Lustre root squash configuration for an Amazon
                            FSx for Lustre file  system.  When  enabled,  root
                            squash  restricts  root-level  access from clients
                            that try to access your  file  system  as  a  root
                            user.

                            RootSquash -> (string)
                               You  enable  root  squash  by setting a user ID
                               (UID) and group ID (GID) for the file system in
                               the  format  UID:GID (for example, 365534:65534
                               ). The UID and GID values can range from  0  to
                               4294967294 :

                               o A non-zero value for UID and GID enables root
                                 squash. The UID and GID values can be differ-
                                 ent, but each must be a non-zero value.

                               o A value of 0 (zero) for UID and GID indicates
                                 root, and therefore disables root squash.

                               When root squash is enabled, the  user  ID  and
                               group ID of a root user accessing the file sys-
                               tem are re-mapped to the UID and GID  you  pro-
                               vide.

                            NoSquashNids -> (list)
                               When root squash is enabled, you can optionally
                               specify an array of NIDs of clients  for  which
                               root  squash  does not apply. A client NID is a
                               Lustre  Network  Identifier  used  to  uniquely
                               identify  a  client. You can specify the NID as
                               either a single  address  or  a  range  of  ad-
                               dresses:

                               o A  single  address  is  described in standard
                                 Lustre NID format by specifying  the  clients
                                 IP  address followed by the Lustre network ID
                                 (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                               o An address range is described using a dash to
                                 separate     the    range    (for    example,
                                 10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                               (string)

                     AdministrativeActions -> (list)
                        A list of administrative actions for the  file  system
                        that are in process or waiting to be processed. Admin-
                        istrative actions describe changes to the  Amazon  FSx
                        system  that  you  have  initiated  using  the Update-
                        FileSystem operation.

                        (structure)
                            Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative ac-
                            tion  for the current Windows, Lustre, OpenZFS, or
                            ONTAP file system or volume.

                            AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                               Describes the type of administrative action, as
                               follows:

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system update ad-
                                 ministrative action initiated from the Amazon
                                 FSx  console, API (UpdateFileSystem ), or CLI
                                 (update-file-system ).

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For Lustre, storage  optimization  consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using  the ProgressPercent property. When STOR-

                                   Aliases -> (list)
                                      An array of one or more DNS aliases that
                                      are currently associated with the Amazon
                                      FSx file system. Aliases  allow  you  to
                                      use  existing  DNS  names  to access the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can  associate  up  to 50 aliases with a
                                      file system at any time. You  can  asso-
                                      ciate  additional  DNS aliases after you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases  operation. You can
                                      remove DNS aliases from the file  system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You only
                                      need  to  specify  the alias name in the
                                      request payload. For  more  information,

                                          the file system. You can use  a  DNS
                                          alias  to access a file system using
                                          user-defined DNS names, in  addition
                                          to  the default DNS name that Amazon
                                          FSx assigns to the file system.  For

                                   DeploymentType -> (string)
                                      The  deployment type of the FSx for Lus-
                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is  designed  for  temporary storage and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1 and  SCRATCH_2  deployment
                                          types  are  best suited for when you
                                          need    temporary    storage     and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2 deployment  type  provides
                                          in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                          higher  burst  throughput   capacity
                                          than SCRATCH_1 .

                                      The  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2 de-
                                      ployment type is  used  for  longer-term
                                      storage  and workloads and encryption of
                                      data  in  transit.  PERSISTENT_2  offers
                                      higher  PerUnitStorageThroughput  (up to
                                      1000 MB/s/TiB) along with a lower  mini-
                                      mum  storage  capacity  requirement (600
                                      GiB). To learn more about FSx for Lustre

                                      ing the file system.

                                      For  the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this
                                      value is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2  ,
                                      PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 deploy-
                                      ment types, this value is a string  that
                                      is  unique within an Amazon Web Services
                                      Region.

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A recurring daily time,  in  the  format
                                      HH:MM  .  HH  is the zero-padded hour of
                                      the  day   (0-23),   and   MM   is   the
                                      zero-padded  minute of the hour. For ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The number of days to  retain  automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables automatic backups. You can  retain
                                      automatic  backups  for  a maximum of 90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags
                                      on  the  file system are copied to back-
                                      ups. If it's set to true,  all  tags  on
                                      the  file system are copied to all auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups  where  the user doesn't specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are
                                      copied  from the file system, regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The type of drive cache used by  PERSIS-
                                      TENT_1 file systems that are provisioned
                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is  required  when  StorageType  is HDD.
                                      When set to READ the file system has  an
                                      SSD  storage  cache that is sized to 20%
                                      of the file system's  storage  capacity.
                                      This  improves  the performance for fre-
                                      quently accessed files by caching up  to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This  parameter  is  required when Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The data compression  configuration  for
                                      the file system. DataCompressionType can
                                      have the following values:

                                      o NONE - Data compression is turned  off
                                        for the file system.

                                      o LZ4  -  Data  compression is turned on
                                        with the LZ4 algorithm.

                                      For more information,  see  Lustre  data

                                   LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The Lustre logging configuration. Lustre
                                      logging writes the  enabled  log  events
                                      for  your  file  system to Amazon Cloud-
                                      Watch Logs.

                                      Level -> (string)
                                          The data repository events that  are
                                          logged by Amazon FSx.

                                          o WARN_ONLY  -  only  warning events
                                            are logged.

                                          o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are
                                            logged.

                                          o WARN_ERROR  -  both warning events
                                            and error events are logged.

                                          o DISABLED - logging of data reposi-
                                            tory events is turned off.

                                          Note  that  Amazon File Cache uses a
                                          default  setting  of  WARN_ERROR   ,
                                          which can't be changed.

                                      Destination -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that
                                          specifies  the  destination  of  the
                                          logs.  The  destination  can  be any
                                          Amazon  CloudWatch  Logs  log  group
                                          ARN.  The destination ARN must be in
                                          the same Amazon Web Services  parti-
                                          tion,  Amazon  Web  Services Region,
                                          and Amazon Web Services  account  as
                                          your Amazon FSx file system.

                                   RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The Lustre root squash configuration for
                                      an Amazon FSx for  Lustre  file  system.
                                      When   enabled,  root  squash  restricts
                                      root-level access from clients that  try
                                      to  access  your  file  system as a root
                                      user.

                                      RootSquash -> (string)
                                          You enable root squash by setting  a
                                          user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for
                                          the  file  system  in   the   format
                                          UID:GID  (for  example, 365534:65534
                                          ). The UID and GID values can  range
                                          from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                          o A  non-zero  value for UID and GID
                                            enables root squash. The  UID  and
                                            GID  values  can be different, but
                                            each must be a non-zero value.

                                          o A value of 0 (zero)  for  UID  and
                                            GID  indicates root, and therefore
                                            disables root squash.

                                          When root  squash  is  enabled,  the
                                          user  ID and group ID of a root user
                                          accessing  the   file   system   are
                                          re-mapped  to  the  UID  and GID you
                                          provide.

                                      NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                          When root squash is enabled, you can
                                          optionally  specify an array of NIDs
                                          of clients  for  which  root  squash
                                          does  not  apply.  A client NID is a
                                          Lustre Network  Identifier  used  to
                                          uniquely  identify a client. You can
                                          specify the NID as either  a  single
                                          address or a range of addresses:

                                          o A  single  address is described in
                                            standard  Lustre  NID  format   by
                                            specifying  the clients IP address
                                            followed by the Lustre network  ID
                                            (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                                          o An  address range is described us-
                                            ing a dash to separate  the  range
                                            (for                      example,
                                            10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                                   NetApp ONTAP file system.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of days to retain automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables  automatic backups. You can retain
                                      automatic backups for a  maximum  of  90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A  recurring  daily  time, in the format
                                      HH:MM . HH is the  zero-padded  hour  of
                                      the   day   (0-23),   and   MM   is  the
                                      zero-padded minute of the hour. For  ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   DeploymentType -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the FSx for ONTAP file system

                                      on the file system should be  copied  to
                                      backups.  If it's set to true , all tags
                                      on the file system are copied to all au-
                                      tomatic  backups  and any user-initiated
                                      backups where the user  doesn't  specify
                                      any  tags. If this value is true and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated   backup,   no  tags  are
                                      copied from the file system,  regardless
                                      of this value.

                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                      The  SSD  IOPS  (input/output operations
                                      per second) configuration for an  Amazon
                                      FSx  for  NetApp  ONTAP,  Amazon FSx for
                                      Windows File Server, or FSx for  OpenZFS
                                      file  system. By default, Amazon FSx au-
                                      tomatically provisions 3 IOPS per GB  of
                                      storage  capacity. You can provision ad-
                                      ditional IOPS per  GB  of  storage.  The
                                      configuration consists of the total num-
                                      ber of provisioned SSD IOPS and  how  it
                                      is  was provisioned, or the mode (by the
                                      customer or by Amazon FSx).

                                      Mode -> (string)

                                          sioned for the file system.

                                          The  minimum  and maximum values for
                                          this property depend on the value of
                                          HAPairs  and  StorageCapacity  . The
                                          minimum value is calculated as Stor-
                                          ageCapacity  *  3  * HAPairs (3 IOPS
                                          per GB  of  StorageCapacity  ).  The
                                          maximum   value   is  calculated  as
                                          200,000 * HAPairs .

                                          Amazon FSx  responds  with  an  HTTP
                                          status code 400 (Bad Request) if the
                                          value of Iops is outside of the min-
                                          imum or maximum values.

                                      (DNS) name or IP address. You can create
                                      a JunctionPath directly below  a  parent
                                      volume junction or on a directory within
                                      a volume. A JunctionPath  for  a  volume
                                      named vol3 might be /vol1/vol2/vol3 , or
                                      /vol1/dir2/vol3      ,      or      even
                                      /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                                   SecurityStyle -> (string)
                                      The security style for the volume, which
                                      can be UNIX , NTFS , or MIXED .

                                   SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                                      The configured size of  the  volume,  in
                                      megabytes (MBs).

                                   StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                                      The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                      The  ID  of the volume's storage virtual
                                      machine.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean flag indicating  whether  this
                                      volume  is the root volume for its stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume  on  an  SVM can be the root volume.
                                      This value defaults to false .  If  this
                                      value  is  true  ,  then this is the SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an  SVM,  because  you must first delete
                                      all non-root volumes.  This  flag,  when
                                      set  to false , helps you identify which
                                      volumes to delete before you can  delete
                                      the SVM.

                                   TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                                      The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                                      CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                                          Specifies  the  number  of days that
                                          user data in a  volume  must  remain
                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold" and  moved  to  the  capacity
                                          pool.  Used  with the AUTO and SNAP-

                                          whole  number between 2 and 183. De-
                                          fault values are 31  days  for  AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          Specifies the tiering policy used to
                                          transition data.  Default  value  is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage
                                            tier.

                                          o AUTO  -  moves  cold user data and
                                            snapshots  to  the  capacity  pool
                                            storage  tier based on your access
                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL - moves all user  data  blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage
                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing it from being moved to the ca-

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The volume's universally unique  identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW specifies a read/write  volume.  RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster occurs,  you  can  use  these
                                        data-protection  mirror  copies to re-
                                        cover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume.  A load-sharing mirror reduces
                                        the network traffic to a FlexVol  vol-
                                        ume  by providing additional read-only
                                        access to clients.

                                   SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                      Specifies the snapshot  policy  for  the
                                      volume.  There  are three built-in snap-
                                      shot policies:

                                      o default : This is the default  policy.
                                        A  maximum  of  six  hourly  snapshots
                                        taken five minutes past  the  hour.  A
                                        maximum  of  two daily snapshots taken
                                        Monday through Saturday at 10  minutes
                                        after   midnight.  A  maximum  of  two
                                        weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at
                                        15 minutes after midnight.

                                      o default-1weekly  :  This policy is the
                                        same as the default policy except that
                                        it  only retains one snapshot from the
                                        weekly schedule.

                                      o none : This policy does not  take  any
                                        snapshots. This policy can be assigned
                                        to volumes to prevent automatic  snap-
                                        shots from being taken.

                                      You  can also provide the name of a cus-
                                      tom policy that you created with the ON-
                                      TAP CLI or REST API.

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to back-
                                      ups.  This  value  defaults to false. If
                                      it's set to true, all tags for the  vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to  all  automatic and
                                      user-initiated backups  where  the  user
                                      doesn't  specify  tags. If this value is
                                      true, and you specify one or more  tags,
                                      only  the  specified  tags are copied to
                                      backups. If you specify one or more tags
                                      when  creating  a user-initiated backup,
                                      no tags are copied from the volume,  re-
                                      gardless of this value.

                                          volume. The default value is false .
                                          If  you set AuditLogVolume to true ,
                                          the SnapLock volume is created as an
                                          audit log volume. The minimum reten-
                                          tion period for an audit log  volume
                                          is six months.

                                      This structure  specifies  configuration
                                      options  for a volumes storage aggregate
                                      or aggregates.

                                      Aggregates -> (list)

                                          volume  resides  on.  Aggregates are
                                          storage pools  which  make  up  your
                                          primary     storage    tier.    Each
                                          high-availability (HA) pair has  one
                                          aggregate.  The  names of the aggre-
                                          gates map to the names of the aggre-
                                          gates in the ONTAP CLI and REST API.
                                          For FlexVols, there will always be a
                                          single entry.

                                          A value that specifies the TagKey  ,
                                          the  name  of the tag. Tag keys must
                                          be unique for the resource to  which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagValue

                                          sponding  tag key. Tag values can be
                                          null and don't have to be unique  in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a key-value pair in a tag set of fi-
                                          nances : April and also of payroll :

                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The maximum amount of storage in  gibib-
                                      tyes  (GiB) that the volume can use from
                                      its parent.  You  can  specify  a  quota
                                      larger  than  the  storage on the parent
                                      volume.

                                   RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                      The record size of an OpenZFS volume, in
                                      kibibytes  (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8,
                                      16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024  KiB.
                                      The  default  is 128 KiB. Most workloads
                                      should use the default record size.  For
                                      guidance  on when to set a custom record
                                      size, see the  Amazon  FSx  for  OpenZFS

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  method  used to compress
                                      the data on the volume. The  compression
                                      type is NONE by default.

                                      o NONE  -  Doesn't  compress the data on
                                        the volume. NONE is the default.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume  using  the  Zstandard (ZSTD) com-
                                        pression algorithm. Compared  to  LZ4,
                                        Z-Standard  provides a better compres-
                                        sion ratio to minimize on-disk storage
                                        utilization.

                                      o LZ4  - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume using the  LZ4  compression  algo-
                                        rithm.  Compared to Z-Standard, LZ4 is
                                        less  compute-intensive  and  delivers
                                        higher write throughput speeds.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean value indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The configuration object that  specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given  resource. ARNs uniquely iden-
                                          tify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                                          We  require  an ARN when you need to
                                          specify  a  resource   unambiguously
                                          across  all  of Amazon Web Services.
                                          For more information, see Amazon Re-
                                          source  Names  (ARNs)  in the Amazon
                                          Web Services General Reference .

                                      CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                          The strategy used when copying  data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE  - The new volume references
                                            the data in the  origin  snapshot.
                                            Cloning  a snapshot is faster than
                                            copying the data from  a  snapshot
                                            to  a  new volume and doesn't con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin  snapshot  can't be deleted

                                   DestinationSnapshot -> (string)
                                      The ID  of  the  snapshot  that's  being
                                      copied  or  was  most recently copied to
                                      the destination volume.

                                   CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                      Specifies the strategy used when copying

                                      o CLONE - The new volume references  the
                                        data in the origin snapshot. Cloning a
                                        snapshot is faster than  copying  data
                                        from  the snapshot to a new volume and
                                        doesn't consume disk throughput.  How-
                                        ever,  the  origin  snapshot  can't be
                                        deleted if there is a volume using its
                                        copied data.

                                      o FULL_COPY  -  Copies all data from the
                                        snapshot to the  new  volume.  Specify
                                        this  option to create the volume from
                                        a snapshot on another FSx for  OpenZFS
                                        file system.

                                          The  INCREMENTAL_COPY option is only
                                          for updating an existing  volume  by
                                          using  a  snapshot  from another FSx

                               ResourceARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a  given
                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services resources. We require an ARN  when

                            Amazon  FSx selects an unused IP address range for
                            you from the 198.19.* range.  By  default  in  the
                            Amazon FSx console, Amazon FSx chooses the last 64
                            IP addresses from the VPCs primary CIDR  range  to
                            use  as the endpoint IP address range for the file
                            system. You can have overlapping endpoint  IP  ad-
                            dresses  for  file  systems  deployed  in the same
                            VPC/route tables.

                               of StorageCapacity ). The maximum value is cal-
                               culated as 200,000 * HAPairs .

                               Amazon  FSx  responds  with an HTTP status code
                               400 (Bad Request) if the value of Iops is  out-
                               side of the minimum or maximum values.

                        The  Lustre  version of the Amazon FSx for Lustre file
                        system, which can be 2.10 , 2.12 , or 2.15 .

                     OpenZFSConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The configuration for this Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file
                        system.

                        AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  days to retain automatic backups.
                            Setting this  property  to  0  disables  automatic
                            backups.  You  can  retain automatic backups for a
                            maximum of 90 days. The default is 30 .

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value indicating  whether  tags  on  the
                            file  system  should be copied to backups. If it's
                            set to true , all tags  on  the  file  system  are
                            copied  to all automatic backups and any user-ini-
                            tiated backups where the user doesn't specify  any
                            tags. If this value is true and you specify one or
                            more tags, only the specified tags are  copied  to
                            backups. If you specify one or more tags when cre-
                            ating a user-initiated backup, no tags are  copied
                            from the file system, regardless of this value.

                        CopyTagsToVolumes -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  value  indicating whether tags for the
                            volume should be copied to snapshots.  This  value
                            defaults to false . If it's set to true , all tags
                            for the volume are copied to snapshots  where  the
                            user  doesn't  specify tags. If this value is true
                            and you specify one or more tags, only the  speci-
                            fied  tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify
                            one or more tags when creating  the  snapshot,  no
                            tags  are  copied  from  the volume, regardless of
                            this value.

                        DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                            A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM  .  HH
                            is  the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM
                            is the zero-padded minute of the hour.  For  exam-
                            ple, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                        DeploymentType -> (string)
                            Specifies  the file-system deployment type. Amazon
                            FSx for OpenZFS supports MULTI_AZ_1 ,  SINGLE_AZ_1
                            , and SINGLE_AZ_2 .

                        ThroughputCapacity -> (integer)
                            The  throughput of an Amazon FSx file system, mea-
                            sured in megabytes per second (MBps).

                        WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                            A recurring weekly time, in the format D:HH:MM .
                               D is the day of the week, for  which  1  repre-
                               sents  Monday and 7 represents Sunday. For fur-
                               ther details, see  the  ISO-8601  spec  as  de-
                               scribed on Wikipedia .

                               HH  is  the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23),
                               and MM is the zero-padded minute of the hour.

                            For example, 1:05:00 specifies maintenance at 5 AM
                            Monday.

                        DiskIopsConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The  SSD IOPS (input/output operations per second)
                            configuration for an Amazon FSx for NetApp  ONTAP,
                            Amazon  FSx  for  Windows  File Server, or FSx for
                            OpenZFS file system. By default, Amazon FSx  auto-
                            matically  provisions 3 IOPS per GB of storage ca-
                            pacity. You can provision additional IOPS  per  GB
                            of  storage. The configuration consists of the to-
                            tal number of provisioned SSD IOPS and how  it  is
                            was  provisioned,  or the mode (by the customer or
                            by Amazon FSx).

                            Mode -> (string)
                               Specifies whether the file system is using  the
                               AUTOMATIC  setting of SSD IOPS of 3 IOPS per GB
                               of  storage  capacity,  ,  or  if  it  using  a
                               USER_PROVISIONED value.

                            Iops -> (long)
                               The  total  number  of SSD IOPS provisioned for
                               the file system.

                               The minimum and maximum values for  this  prop-
                               erty  depend  on the value of HAPairs and Stor-
                               ageCapacity . The minimum value  is  calculated
                               as StorageCapacity * 3 * HAPairs (3 IOPS per GB
                               of StorageCapacity ). The maximum value is cal-
                               culated as 200,000 * HAPairs .

                               Amazon  FSx  responds  with an HTTP status code
                               400 (Bad Request) if the value of Iops is  out-
                               side of the minimum or maximum values.

                        RootVolumeId -> (string)
                            The ID of the root volume of the OpenZFS file sys-
                            tem.

                        PreferredSubnetId -> (string)
                            Required when DeploymentType is set to  MULTI_AZ_1
                            .  This specifies the subnet in which you want the
                            preferred file server to be located.

                        EndpointIpAddressRange -> (string)
                            (Multi-AZ only) Specifies the IP address range  in
                            which  the  endpoints  to  access your file system
                            will be created. By default in the Amazon FSx  API
                            and  Amazon  FSx  console,  Amazon  FSx selects an
                            available /28 IP address range for you from one of
                            the  VPC's  CIDR  ranges. You can have overlapping
                            endpoint IP addresses for file systems deployed in
                            the same VPC/route tables.

                        RouteTableIds -> (list)
                            (Multi-AZ only) The VPC route tables in which your
                            file system's endpoints are created.

                            (string)

                        EndpointIpAddress -> (string)
                            The IP address of the endpoint that is used to ac-

                 TargetVolumeValues -> (structure)
                     Describes an Amazon FSx volume.

                     CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                        The  time  that  the  resource was created, in seconds
                        (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

                     FileSystemId -> (string)
                        The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by
                        Amazon FSx.

                     Lifecycle -> (string)

                              volume.

                        JunctionPath -> (string)
                            Specifies   the  directory  that  network-attached
                            storage (NAS) clients use  to  mount  the  volume,
                            along  with  the storage virtual machine (SVM) Do-
                            main Name System (DNS) name or IP address. You can
                            create a JunctionPath directly below a parent vol-
                            ume junction or on a directory within a volume.  A
                            JunctionPath  for  a  volume  named  vol3 might be
                            /vol1/vol2/vol3 , or  /vol1/dir2/vol3  ,  or  even
                            /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                            the root volume for its  storage  virtual  machine
                            (SVM).  Only  one volume on an SVM can be the root
                            volume. This value defaults to  false  .  If  this
                            value is true , then this is the SVM root volume.

                            This  flag  is useful when you're deleting an SVM,
                            because you must first delete  all  non-root  vol-
                            umes.  This  flag,  when  set to false , helps you
                            identify which volumes to delete  before  you  can
                            delete the SVM.

                               Specifies  the number of days that user data in
                               a volume must remain inactive before it is con-
                               sidered  "cold" and moved to the capacity pool.
                               Used with the AUTO  and  SNAPSHOT_ONLY  tiering
                               policies.  Enter  a  whole number between 2 and
                               183. Default values are 31 days for AUTO and  2
                               days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                            Name -> (string)
                               Specifies the tiering policy used to transition
                               data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                               o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold snapshots  to  the
                                 capacity pool storage tier.

                               o AUTO  - moves cold user data and snapshots to
                                 the capacity pool storage tier based on  your
                                 access patterns.

                               o ALL  - moves all user data blocks in both the
                                 active file system and Snapshot copies to the
                                 storage pool tier.

                               o NONE  -  keeps a volume's data in the primary
                                 storage tier, preventing it from being  moved
                                 to the capacity pool tier.

                        UUID -> (string)
                            The volume's universally unique identifier (UUID).

                        OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                            Specifies the type of volume. Valid values are the
                            following:

                            o RW specifies a read/write volume. RW is the  de-
                              fault.

                            o DP  specifies  a data-protection volume. You can
                              protect data by replicating it  to  data-protec-
                              tion  mirror  copies.  If a disaster occurs, you
                              can use these data-protection mirror  copies  to
                              recover data.

                            o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror volume. A
                              load-sharing mirror reduces the network  traffic
                              to  a  FlexVol  volume  by  providing additional
                              read-only access to clients.

                        SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                            Specifies the  snapshot  policy  for  the  volume.
                            There are three built-in snapshot policies:

                            o default  : This is the default policy. A maximum
                              of six hourly snapshots taken five minutes  past
                              the hour. A maximum of two daily snapshots taken
                              Monday through Saturday at 10 minutes after mid-
                              night.  A  maximum of two weekly snapshots taken
                              every Sunday at 15 minutes after midnight.

                            o default-1weekly : This policy is the same as the
                              default  policy  except that it only retains one
                              snapshot from the weekly schedule.

                            o none : This policy does not take any  snapshots.
                              This  policy  can be assigned to volumes to pre-
                              vent automatic snapshots from being taken.

                            You can also provide the name of a  custom  policy
                            that you created with the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                            For more information, see Snapshot policies in the
                            Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide.

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags  for  the
                            volume should be copied to backups. This value de-
                            faults to false. If it's set to true, all tags for
                            the   volume  are  copied  to  all  automatic  and
                            user-initiated  backups  where  the  user  doesn't
                            specify tags. If this value is true, and you spec-
                            ify one or more tags, only the specified tags  are
                            copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags
                            when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are
                            copied from the volume, regardless of this value.

                        SnaplockConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The  SnapLock  configuration object for an FSx for
                            ONTAP SnapLock volume.

                            AuditLogVolume -> (boolean)
                               Enables or disables the audit log volume for an
                               FSx  for  ONTAP  SnapLock  volume.  The default
                               value is false . If you set  AuditLogVolume  to
                               true , the SnapLock volume is created as an au-
                               dit log volume. The  minimum  retention  period
                               for an audit log volume is six months.

                               For  more  information,  see SnapLock audit log
                               volumes .

                            AutocommitPeriod -> (structure)
                               The configuration object for setting the  auto-
                               commit  period  of  files  in  an FSx for ONTAP
                               SnapLock volume.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   Defines the type of time for the autocommit
                                   period  of  a  file  in  an  FSx  for ONTAP
                                   SnapLock volume. Setting this value to NONE
                                   disables  autocommit.  The default value is
                                   NONE .

                               Value -> (integer)

                                   mit  period  of  a file in an FSx for ONTAP
                                   SnapLock volume. The following  ranges  are
                                   valid:

                                   o Minutes : 5 - 65,535

                                   o Hours : 1 - 65,535

                            PrivilegedDelete -> (string)
                               Enables,   disables,  or  permanently  disables
                               privileged delete on an FSx for ONTAP  SnapLock
                               Enterprise  volume.  Enabling privileged delete
                               allows SnapLock administrators to delete  write
                               once,  read many (WORM) files even if they have
                               active retention periods.  PERMANENTLY_DISABLED
                               is  a  terminal  state. If privileged delete is
                               permanently disabled on a SnapLock volume,  you
                               can't  re-enable  it. The default value is DIS-
                               ABLED .

                               For more information, see Privileged delete .

                            RetentionPeriod -> (structure)

                                   an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.  The  de-
                                   fault retention period must be greater than
                                   or equal to the  minimum  retention  period
                                   and  less  than or equal to the maximum re-

                               your primary storage tier. Each high-availabil-
                               ity  (HA)  pair has one aggregate. The names of
                               the aggregates map to the names of  the  aggre-
                               gates  in  the  ONTAP  CLI  and  REST  API. For
                               FlexVols, there will always be a single entry.

                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For Lustre, storage  optimization  consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using  the ProgressPercent property. When STOR-

                                   PreferredSubnetId -> (string)
                                      For   MULTI_AZ_1  deployment  types,  it
                                      specifies the ID of the subnet where the
                                      preferred  file  server is located. Must
                                      be one of the two subnet  IDs  specified
                                      in SubnetIds property. Amazon FSx serves
                                      traffic from this subnet except  in  the

                                      ment  types,  this  value is the same as

                                      backups.  This  value defaults to false.
                                      If it's set to true,  all  tags  on  the
                                      file  system are copied to all automatic
                                      backups and any  user-initiated  backups
                                      where the user doesn't specify any tags.
                                      If this value is true, and  you  specify
                                      one  or  more  tags,  only the specified
                                      tags are copied to backups. If you spec-
                                      ify  one  or  more  tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are

                                      of this value.

                                   Aliases -> (list)
                                      An array of one or more DNS aliases that

                                      FSx file system. Aliases  allow  you  to
                                      use  existing  DNS  names  to access the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can  associate  up  to 50 aliases with a
                                      file system at any time. You  can  asso-
                                      ciate  additional  DNS aliases after you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases  operation. You can
                                      remove DNS aliases from the file  system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You only
                                      need  to  specify  the alias name in the
                                      request payload. For  more  information,

                                          the file system. You can use  a  DNS
                                          alias  to access a file system using
                                          user-defined DNS names, in  addition
                                          to  the default DNS name that Amazon
                                          FSx assigns to the file system.  For

                                   DeploymentType -> (string)
                                      The  deployment type of the FSx for Lus-
                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is  designed  for  temporary storage and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1 and  SCRATCH_2  deployment
                                          types  are  best suited for when you
                                          need    temporary    storage     and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2 deployment  type  provides
                                          in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                          higher  burst  throughput   capacity
                                          than SCRATCH_1 .

                                      The  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2 de-
                                      ployment type is  used  for  longer-term
                                      storage  and workloads and encryption of
                                      data  in  transit.  PERSISTENT_2  offers
                                      higher  PerUnitStorageThroughput  (up to
                                      1000 MB/s/TiB) along with a lower  mini-
                                      mum  storage  capacity  requirement (600
                                      GiB). To learn more about FSx for Lustre

                                   PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                                      Per unit storage  throughput  represents
                                      the  megabytes  per  second  of  read or
                                      write throughput per 1 tebibyte of stor-
                                      age  provisioned. File system throughput
                                      capacity is equal  to  Storage  capacity
                                      (TiB)     *     PerUnitStorageThroughput
                                      (MB/s/TiB). This option  is  only  valid
                                      for  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2 de-
                                      ployment types.

                                      Valid values:

                                      o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100,
                                        200.

                                      ing the file system.

                                      For  the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this
                                      value is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2  ,
                                      PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 deploy-
                                      ment types, this value is a string  that
                                      is  unique within an Amazon Web Services
                                      Region.

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A recurring daily time,  in  the  format
                                      HH:MM  .  HH  is the zero-padded hour of
                                      the  day   (0-23),   and   MM   is   the
                                      zero-padded  minute of the hour. For ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The number of days to  retain  automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables automatic backups. You can  retain
                                      automatic  backups  for  a maximum of 90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags
                                      on  the  file system are copied to back-
                                      ups. If it's set to true,  all  tags  on
                                      the  file system are copied to all auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups  where  the user doesn't specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are
                                      copied  from the file system, regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The type of drive cache used by  PERSIS-
                                      TENT_1 file systems that are provisioned
                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is  required  when  StorageType  is HDD.
                                      When set to READ the file system has  an
                                      SSD  storage  cache that is sized to 20%
                                      of the file system's  storage  capacity.
                                      This  improves  the performance for fre-
                                      quently accessed files by caching up  to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This  parameter  is  required when Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The data compression  configuration  for
                                      the file system. DataCompressionType can
                                      have the following values:

                                      o NONE - Data compression is turned  off
                                        for the file system.

                                      o LZ4  -  Data  compression is turned on
                                        with the LZ4 algorithm.

                                          logged by Amazon FSx.

                                          o WARN_ONLY  -  only  warning events
                                            are logged.

                                          o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are
                                            logged.

                                          o WARN_ERROR  -  both warning events
                                            and error events are logged.

                                          o DISABLED - logging of data reposi-
                                            tory events is turned off.

                                          Note  that  Amazon File Cache uses a
                                          default  setting  of  WARN_ERROR   ,
                                          which can't be changed.

                                      Destination -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that
                                          specifies  the  destination  of  the
                                          logs.  The  destination  can  be any
                                          Amazon  CloudWatch  Logs  log  group
                                          ARN.  The destination ARN must be in
                                          the same Amazon Web Services  parti-
                                          tion,  Amazon  Web  Services Region,

                                   RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The Lustre root squash configuration for
                                      an Amazon FSx for  Lustre  file  system.
                                      When   enabled,  root  squash  restricts
                                      root-level access from clients that  try
                                      to  access  your  file  system as a root
                                      user.

                                      RootSquash -> (string)
                                          You enable root squash by setting  a
                                          user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for
                                          the  file  system  in   the   format
                                          UID:GID  (for  example, 365534:65534
                                          ). The UID and GID values can  range
                                          from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                          o A  non-zero  value for UID and GID
                                            enables root squash. The  UID  and
                                            GID  values  can be different, but
                                            each must be a non-zero value.

                                          o A value of 0 (zero)  for  UID  and
                                            GID  indicates root, and therefore
                                            disables root squash.

                                          When root  squash  is  enabled,  the
                                          user  ID and group ID of a root user
                                          accessing  the   file   system   are
                                          re-mapped  to  the  UID  and GID you
                                          provide.

                                      NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                          When root squash is enabled, you can
                                          optionally  specify an array of NIDs
                                          of clients  for  which  root  squash
                                          does  not  apply.  A client NID is a
                                          Lustre Network  Identifier  used  to
                                          uniquely  identify a client. You can
                                          specify the NID as either  a  single
                                          address or a range of addresses:

                                          o A  single  address is described in
                                            standard  Lustre  NID  format   by
                                            specifying  the clients IP address
                                            followed by the Lustre network  ID
                                            (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                                          o An  address range is described us-
                                            ing a dash to separate  the  range
                                            (for                      example,
                                            10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables  automatic backups. You can retain
                                      automatic backups for a  maximum  of  90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A  recurring  daily  time, in the format
                                      HH:MM . HH is the  zero-padded  hour  of
                                      the   day   (0-23),   and   MM   is  the
                                      zero-padded minute of the hour. For  ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                      The  SSD  IOPS  (input/output operations
                                      per second) configuration for an  Amazon
                                      FSx  for  NetApp  ONTAP,  Amazon FSx for
                                      Windows File Server, or FSx for  OpenZFS
                                      file  system. By default, Amazon FSx au-
                                      tomatically provisions 3 IOPS per GB  of
                                      storage  capacity. You can provision ad-
                                      ditional IOPS per  GB  of  storage.  The
                                      configuration consists of the total num-
                                      ber of provisioned SSD IOPS and  how  it
                                      is  was provisioned, or the mode (by the
                                      customer or by Amazon FSx).

                                      Mode -> (string)

                                          The  minimum  and maximum values for
                                          this property depend on the value of
                                          HAPairs  and  StorageCapacity  . The
                                          minimum value is calculated as Stor-
                                          ageCapacity  *  3  * HAPairs (3 IOPS
                                          per GB  of  StorageCapacity  ).  The
                                          maximum   value   is  calculated  as
                                          200,000 * HAPairs .

                                          Amazon FSx  responds  with  an  HTTP
                                          status code 400 (Bad Request) if the
                                          value of Iops is outside of the min-
                                          imum or maximum values.

                            The record size of an OpenZFS volume, in kibibytes
                            (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8,  16,  32,  64,  128,
                            256,  512,  or  1024  KiB. The default is 128 KiB.
                            Most workloads should use the default record size.
                            For  guidance on when to set a custom record size,
                            see the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

                        DataCompressionType -> (string)
                            Specifies the method used to compress the data  on
                            the  volume.  The  compression type is NONE by de-
                            fault.

                            o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the  volume.
                              NONE is the default.

                            o ZSTD  -  Compresses the data in the volume using
                              the Zstandard (ZSTD) compression algorithm. Com-
                              pared  to LZ4, Z-Standard provides a better com-
                              pression ratio to minimize on-disk storage  uti-
                              lization.

                            o LZ4  -  Compresses  the data in the volume using
                              the  LZ4  compression  algorithm.  Compared   to
                              Z-Standard,  LZ4  is  less compute-intensive and
                              delivers higher write throughput speeds.

                        CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value indicating whether  tags  for  the
                            volume  should  be copied to snapshots. This value
                            defaults to false . If it's set to true , all tags
                            for  the  volume are copied to snapshots where the
                            user doesn't specify tags. If this value  is  true
                            and  you specify one or more tags, only the speci-
                            fied tags are copied to snapshots. If you  specify
                            one  or  more  tags when creating the snapshot, no
                            tags are copied from  the  volume,  regardless  of
                            this value.

                        OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                            The  configuration object that specifies the snap-
                            shot to use as the origin of the data for the vol-
                            ume.

                            SnapshotARN -> (string)
                               The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given re-
                               source. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web  Ser-
                               vices  resources.  We  require  an ARN when you
                               need to specify a resource unambiguously across
                               all  of  Amazon Web Services. For more informa-
                               tion, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  in  the
                               Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                            CopyStrategy -> (string)
                               The  strategy  used  when copying data from the
                               snapshot to the new volume.

                               o CLONE - The new volume references the data in
                                 the  origin  snapshot.  Cloning a snapshot is
                                 faster than copying the data from a  snapshot
                                 to  a  new  volume  and  doesn't consume disk
                                 throughput.  However,  the  origin   snapshot
                                 can't  be  deleted if there is a volume using
                                 its copied data.

                               o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the snapshot
                                 to the new volume.

                               NOTE:
                                   The INCREMENTAL_COPY option is only for up-
                                   dating an existing volume by using a  snap-
                                   shot from another FSx for OpenZFS file sys-
                                   tem.    For    more    information,     see
                                   CopySnapshotAndUpdateVolume .

                        ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  value indicating whether the volume is
                            read-only.

                        NfsExports -> (list)
                            The configuration object for  mounting  a  Network
                            File System (NFS) file system.

                            (structure)
                               The  Network  File  System (NFS) configurations
                               for mounting an Amazon  FSx  for  OpenZFS  file
                               system.

                               ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                                   A  list  of configuration objects that con-
                                   tain the client and  options  for  mounting
                                   the OpenZFS file system.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  who can mount an OpenZFS file
                                      system and the options  available  while
                                      mounting the file system.

                                      Clients -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies who can mount
                                          the file system. You can  provide  a
                                          wildcard  character  (* ), an IP ad-
                                          dress (0.0.0.0 ), or a CIDR  address
                                          (192.0.2.0/24  ). By default, Amazon
                                          FSx uses the wildcard character when
                                          specifying the client.

                                      Options -> (list)
                                          The options to use when mounting the
                                          file system. For a list  of  options
                                          that  you  can use with Network File
                                          System (NFS), see the  exports(5)  -
                                          Linux  man page . When choosing your
                                          options, consider the following:

                                          o crossmnt is used  by  default.  If
                                            you  don't  specify  crossmnt when
                                            changing the client configuration,
                                            you won't be able to see or access
                                            snapshots in  your  file  system's
                                            snapshot directory.

                                          o sync  is  used  by default. If you
                                            instead specify async , the system
                                            acknowledges writes before writing
                                            to disk. If the system crashes be-
                                            fore  the writes are finished, you
                                            lose the unwritten data.

                                          (string)

                        UserAndGroupQuotas -> (list)
                            An object specifying how  much  storage  users  or
                            groups can use on the volume.

                            (structure)
                               The  configuration  for how much storage a user
                               or group can use on the volume.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   A value that specifies  whether  the  quota
                                   applies to a user or group.

                               Id -> (integer)
                                   The ID of the user or group.

                               StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                   The  amount  of  storage  that  the user or
                                   group can use in gibibytes (GiB).

                        RestoreToSnapshot -> (string)
                            Specifies the ID of the snapshot to which the vol-
                            ume was restored.

                        DeleteIntermediateSnaphots -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  value indicating whether snapshots be-
                            tween the current state and the specified snapshot
                            should  be  deleted when a volume is restored from
                            snapshot.

                        DeleteClonedVolumes -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value indicating whether dependent clone
                            volumes created from intermediate snapshots should
                            be deleted when a volume is  restored  from  snap-
                            shot.

                        DeleteIntermediateData -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  value indicating whether snapshot data
                            that differs between the  current  state  and  the
                            specified  snapshot  should  be overwritten when a
                            volume is restored from a snapshot.

                        SourceSnapshotARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  for  a  given  re-
                            source. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services
                            resources. We require an  ARN  when  you  need  to
                            specify  a  resource  unambiguously  across all of
                            Amazon Web Services.  For  more  information,  see
                            Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs)  in the Amazon Web
                            Services General Reference .

                        DestinationSnapshot -> (string)
                            The ID of the snapshot that's being copied or  was
                            most recently copied to the destination volume.

                        CopyStrategy -> (string)
                            Specifies the strategy used when copying data from
                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                            o CLONE - The new volume references  the  data  in
                              the  origin  snapshot.  Cloning  a  snapshot  is
                              faster than copying data from the snapshot to  a
                              new  volume and doesn't consume disk throughput.
                              However, the origin snapshot can't be deleted if
                              there is a volume using its copied data.

                            o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the snapshot to
                              the new volume. Specify this  option  to  create
                              the  volume  from  a snapshot on another FSx for
                              OpenZFS file system.

                            NOTE:
                               The INCREMENTAL_COPY option is only for  updat-
                               ing an existing volume by using a snapshot from
                               another FSx for OpenZFS file system.  For  more
                               information, see CopySnapshotAndUpdateVolume .

                 TargetSnapshotValues -> (structure)

                     ResourceARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for a given resource.
                        ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                        We  require an ARN when you need to specify a resource
                        unambiguously across all of Amazon Web  Services.  For
                        more  information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
                        the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                     SnapshotId -> (string)
                        The ID of the snapshot.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the snapshot.

                     VolumeId -> (string)
                        The ID of the volume that the snapshot is of.

                     CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time that the resource  was  created,  in  seconds
                        (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

                     Lifecycle -> (string)
                        The lifecycle status of the snapshot.

                        o PENDING  -  Amazon  FSx  hasn't started creating the
                          snapshot.

                        o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the snapshot.

                        o DELETING - Amazon FSx is deleting the snapshot.

                        o AVAILABLE - The snapshot is fully available.

                     LifecycleTransitionReason -> (structure)
                        Describes why a resource lifecycle state changed.

                                      For  MULTI_AZ_1  deployment  types,  use
                                      this  endpoint  when performing adminis-
                                      trative tasks on the file  system  using
                                      Amazon FSx Remote PowerShell.

                                      For  SINGLE_AZ_1 and SINGLE_AZ_2 deploy-
                                      ment types, this is the DNS name of  the
                                      file system.

                                      This endpoint is temporarily unavailable
                                      when the file system is undergoing main-

                                   PreferredSubnetId -> (string)
                                      For   MULTI_AZ_1  deployment  types,  it
                                      specifies the ID of the subnet where the
                                      preferred  file  server is located. Must
                                      be one of the two subnet  IDs  specified
                                      in SubnetIds property. Amazon FSx serves
                                      traffic from this subnet except  in  the

                                      FSx file system. Aliases  allow  you  to
                                      use  existing  DNS  names  to access the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can  associate  up  to 50 aliases with a
                                      file system at any time. You  can  asso-
                                      ciate  additional  DNS aliases after you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases  operation. You can
                                      remove DNS aliases from the file  system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You only
                                      need  to  specify  the alias name in the
                                      request payload. For  more  information,

                                          the file system. You can use  a  DNS
                                          alias  to access a file system using
                                          user-defined DNS names, in  addition
                                          to  the default DNS name that Amazon
                                          FSx assigns to the file system.  For

                                   DeploymentType -> (string)
                                      The  deployment type of the FSx for Lus-
                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is  designed  for  temporary storage and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1 and  SCRATCH_2  deployment
                                          types  are  best suited for when you
                                          need    temporary    storage     and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2 deployment  type  provides
                                          in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                          higher  burst  throughput   capacity
                                          than SCRATCH_1 .

                                      The  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2 de-
                                      ployment type is  used  for  longer-term
                                      storage  and workloads and encryption of
                                      data  in  transit.  PERSISTENT_2  offers
                                      higher  PerUnitStorageThroughput  (up to
                                      1000 MB/s/TiB) along with a lower  mini-
                                      mum  storage  capacity  requirement (600
                                      GiB). To learn more about FSx for Lustre

                                   PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                                      Per unit storage  throughput  represents
                                      the  megabytes  per  second  of  read or
                                      write throughput per 1 tebibyte of stor-
                                      age  provisioned. File system throughput
                                      capacity is equal  to  Storage  capacity
                                      (TiB)     *     PerUnitStorageThroughput
                                      (MB/s/TiB). This option  is  only  valid
                                      for  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2 de-
                                      ployment types.

                                      Valid values:

                                      o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100,

                                      o For  PERSISTENT_2  SSD  storage:  125,
                                        250, 500, 1000.

                                   MountName -> (string)
                                      You use the MountName value when  mount-
                                      ing the file system.

                                      For  the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this
                                      value is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2  ,
                                      PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 deploy-
                                      ment types, this value is a string  that
                                      is  unique within an Amazon Web Services
                                      Region.

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A recurring daily time,  in  the  format
                                      HH:MM  .  HH  is the zero-padded hour of
                                      the  day   (0-23),   and   MM   is   the
                                      zero-padded  minute of the hour. For ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The number of days to  retain  automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables automatic backups. You can  retain
                                      automatic  backups  for  a maximum of 90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags
                                      on  the  file system are copied to back-
                                      ups. If it's set to true,  all  tags  on
                                      the  file system are copied to all auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups  where  the user doesn't specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are
                                      copied  from the file system, regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The type of drive cache used by  PERSIS-
                                      TENT_1 file systems that are provisioned
                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is  required  when  StorageType  is HDD.
                                      When set to READ the file system has  an
                                      SSD  storage  cache that is sized to 20%
                                      of the file system's  storage  capacity.
                                      This  improves  the performance for fre-
                                      quently accessed files by caching up  to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This  parameter  is  required when Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The data compression  configuration  for
                                      the file system. DataCompressionType can
                                      have the following values:

                                      o NONE - Data compression is turned  off
                                        for the file system.

                                      o LZ4  -  Data  compression is turned on
                                        with the LZ4 algorithm.

                                      For more information,  see  Lustre  data

                                      Level -> (string)
                                          The data repository events that  are
                                          logged by Amazon FSx.

                                          o WARN_ONLY  -  only  warning events
                                            are logged.

                                          o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are
                                            logged.

                                          o WARN_ERROR  -  both warning events
                                            and error events are logged.

                                          o DISABLED - logging of data reposi-
                                            tory events is turned off.

                                          Note  that  Amazon File Cache uses a
                                          default  setting  of  WARN_ERROR   ,
                                          which can't be changed.

                                      Destination -> (string)
                                          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that

                                   RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The Lustre root squash configuration for
                                      an Amazon FSx for  Lustre  file  system.
                                      When   enabled,  root  squash  restricts
                                      root-level access from clients that  try
                                      to  access  your  file  system as a root
                                      user.

                                      RootSquash -> (string)
                                          You enable root squash by setting  a
                                          user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for
                                          the  file  system  in   the   format
                                          UID:GID  (for  example, 365534:65534
                                          ). The UID and GID values can  range
                                          from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                          o A  non-zero  value for UID and GID
                                            enables root squash. The  UID  and
                                            GID  values  can be different, but
                                            each must be a non-zero value.

                                          o A value of 0 (zero)  for  UID  and
                                            GID  indicates root, and therefore
                                            disables root squash.

                                          When root  squash  is  enabled,  the
                                          user  ID and group ID of a root user
                                          accessing  the   file   system   are
                                          re-mapped  to  the  UID  and GID you
                                          provide.

                                      NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                          When root squash is enabled, you can
                                          optionally  specify an array of NIDs
                                          of clients  for  which  root  squash
                                          does  not  apply.  A client NID is a
                                          Lustre Network  Identifier  used  to
                                          uniquely  identify a client. You can
                                          specify the NID as either  a  single
                                          address or a range of addresses:

                                          o A  single  address is described in

                                            specifying  the clients IP address
                                            followed by the Lustre network  ID
                                            (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                                          o An  address range is described us-

                                      automatic backups for a  maximum  of  90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean value indicating whether tags
                                      on the file system should be  copied  to
                                      backups.  If it's set to true , all tags
                                      on the file system are copied to all au-
                                      tomatic  backups  and any user-initiated

                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated   backup,   no  tags  are
                                      copied from the file system,  regardless
                                      of this value.

                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                      file  system. By default, Amazon FSx au-
                                      tomatically provisions 3 IOPS per GB  of
                                      storage  capacity. You can provision ad-
                                      ditional IOPS per  GB  of  storage.  The
                                      configuration consists of the total num-
                                      ber of provisioned SSD IOPS and  how  it
                                      is  was provisioned, or the mode (by the

                                   StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                      The  ID  of the volume's storage virtual
                                      machine.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean flag indicating  whether  this
                                      volume  is the root volume for its stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume  on  an  SVM can be the root volume.
                                      This value defaults to false .  If  this
                                      value  is  true  ,  then this is the SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an  SVM,  because  you must first delete
                                      all non-root volumes.  This  flag,  when
                                      set  to false , helps you identify which
                                      volumes to delete before you can  delete
                                      the SVM.

                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold" and  moved  to  the  capacity
                                          pool.  Used  with the AUTO and SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY tiering policies. Enter  a
                                          whole  number between 2 and 183. De-
                                          fault values are 31  days  for  AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing it from being moved to the ca-
                                            pacity pool tier.

                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW specifies a read/write  volume.  RW
                                        is the default.

                                      volume.  There  are three built-in snap-

                                      o default : This is the default  policy.
                                        A  maximum  of  six  hourly  snapshots
                                        taken five minutes past  the  hour.  A
                                        maximum  of  two daily snapshots taken
                                        Monday through Saturday at 10  minutes
                                        after   midnight.  A  maximum  of  two
                                        weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at
                                        15 minutes after midnight.

                                      o default-1weekly  :  This policy is the
                                        same as the default policy except that
                                        it  only retains one snapshot from the
                                        weekly schedule.

                                      o none : This policy does not  take  any
                                        snapshots. This policy can be assigned
                                        to volumes to prevent automatic  snap-
                                        shots from being taken.

                                      You  can also provide the name of a cus-
                                      tom policy that you created with the ON-
                                      TAP CLI or REST API.

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to back-
                                      ups.  This  value  defaults to false. If
                                      it's set to true, all tags for the  vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to  all  automatic and
                                      user-initiated backups  where  the  user
                                      doesn't  specify  tags. If this value is
                                      true, and you specify one or more  tags,
                                      only  the  specified  tags are copied to
                                      backups. If you specify one or more tags
                                      when  creating  a user-initiated backup,
                                      no tags are copied from the volume,  re-
                                      gardless of this value.

                                          volume. The default value is false .
                                          If  you set AuditLogVolume to true ,
                                          the SnapLock volume is created as an
                                          audit log volume. The minimum reten-
                                          tion period for an audit log  volume
                                          is six months.

                                   VolumePath -> (string)
                                      The  path  to  the  volume from the root
                                      volume.  For   example,   fsx/parentVol-
                                      ume/volume1 .

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to reserve from the parent  volume.  You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The maximum amount of storage in  gibib-
                                      tyes  (GiB) that the volume can use from
                                      its parent.  You  can  specify  a  quota
                                      larger  than  the  storage on the parent
                                      volume.

                                   RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                      The record size of an OpenZFS volume, in
                                      kibibytes  (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8,
                                      16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024  KiB.
                                      The  default  is 128 KiB. Most workloads
                                      should use the default record size.  For
                                      guidance  on when to set a custom record
                                      size, see the  Amazon  FSx  for  OpenZFS

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  method  used to compress
                                      the data on the volume. The  compression
                                      type is NONE by default.

                                      o NONE  -  Doesn't  compress the data on
                                        the volume. NONE is the default.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume  using  the  Zstandard (ZSTD) com-
                                        pression algorithm. Compared  to  LZ4,
                                        Z-Standard  provides a better compres-
                                        sion ratio to minimize on-disk storage
                                        utilization.

                                      o LZ4  - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume using the  LZ4  compression  algo-
                                        rithm.  Compared to Z-Standard, LZ4 is
                                        less  compute-intensive  and  delivers
                                        higher write throughput speeds.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean value indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The configuration object that  specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given  resource. ARNs uniquely iden-
                                          tify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                                          We  require  an ARN when you need to
                                          specify  a  resource   unambiguously
                                          across  all  of Amazon Web Services.
                                          For more information, see Amazon Re-

                                      CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                          The strategy used when copying  data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE  - The new volume references
                                            the data in the  origin  snapshot.
                                            Cloning  a snapshot is faster than
                                            copying the data from  a  snapshot
                                            to  a  new volume and doesn't con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin  snapshot  can't be deleted
                                            if there is  a  volume  using  its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY  -  Copies all data from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          NOTE:
                                             The  INCREMENTAL_COPY  option  is
                                             only  for  updating  an  existing
                                             volume by using a  snapshot  from
                                             another FSx for OpenZFS file sys-

                                   ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  value indicating whether the
                                      volume is read-only.

                                   NfsExports -> (list)
                                      The configuration object for mounting  a
                                      Network File System (NFS) file system.

                                          ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                                             A  list  of configuration objects
                                             that contain the client  and  op-
                                             tions  for  mounting  the OpenZFS
                                             file system.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Specifies who  can  mount  an

                                                 mounting the file system.

                                                 Clients -> (string)
                                                    A value that specifies who
                                                    can mount the file system.
                                                    You can provide a wildcard

                                   SourceSnapshotARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a
                                      given  resource.  ARNs uniquely identify
                                      Amazon Web Services  resources.  We  re-
                                      quire  an ARN when you need to specify a
                                      resource  unambiguously  across  all  of
                                      Amazon  Web  Services. For more informa-

                                      The ID  of  the  snapshot  that's  being
                                      copied  or  was  most recently copied to
                                      the destination volume.

                                   CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                      Specifies the strategy used when copying
                                      data  from  the snapshot to the new vol-
                                      ume.

                                      o CLONE - The new volume references  the
                                        data in the origin snapshot. Cloning a
                                        snapshot is faster than  copying  data
                                        from  the snapshot to a new volume and
                                        doesn't consume disk throughput.  How-
                                        ever,  the  origin  snapshot  can't be
                                        deleted if there is a volume using its
                                        copied data.

                                      o FULL_COPY  -  Copies all data from the
                                        snapshot to the  new  volume.  Specify
                                        this  option to create the volume from
                                        a snapshot on another FSx for  OpenZFS
                                        file system.

                                      NOTE:
                                          The  INCREMENTAL_COPY option is only
                                          for updating an existing  volume  by
                                          using  a  snapshot  from another FSx

                                     ating the snapshot.

                                   o CREATING  -  Amazon  FSx  is creating the
                                     snapshot.

                                   o DELETING - Amazon  FSx  is  deleting  the

              VolumePath -> (string)
                 The path to the volume from the  root  volume.  For  example,
                 fsx/parentVolume/volume1 .

              StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                 The  amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to reserve from the
                 parent volume. You can't reserve more storage than the parent
                 volume has reserved.

              StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  amount  of  storage in gibibtyes (GiB) that the
                 volume can use from its  parent.  You  can  specify  a  quota
                 larger than the storage on the parent volume.

              RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                 The  record  size  of  an OpenZFS volume, in kibibytes (KiB).
                 Valid values are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128,  256,  512,  or  1024
                 KiB.  The  default  is 128 KiB. Most workloads should use the
                 default record size. For guidance on when  to  set  a  custom
                 record size, see the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

              DataCompressionType -> (string)
                 Specifies the method used to compress the data on the volume.
                 The compression type is NONE by default.

                 o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the volume. NONE is the
                   default.

                 o ZSTD  -  Compresses the data in the volume using the Zstan-
                   dard (ZSTD) compression algorithm. Compared to LZ4, Z-Stan-
                   dard  provides  a  better  compression  ratio  to  minimize
                   on-disk storage utilization.

                 o LZ4 - Compresses the data in the volume using the LZ4  com-
                   pression  algorithm.  Compared  to  Z-Standard, LZ4 is less
                   compute-intensive  and  delivers  higher  write  throughput
                   speeds.

              CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the volume should
                 be copied to snapshots. This value defaults  to  false  .  If
                 it's  set  to  true  ,  all tags for the volume are copied to
                 snapshots where the user doesn't specify tags. If this  value
                 is  true and you specify one or more tags, only the specified
                 tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify one or more tags
                 when  creating the snapshot, no tags are copied from the vol-
                 ume, regardless of this value.

              OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                 The configuration object that specifies the snapshot  to  use
                 as the origin of the data for the volume.

                 SnapshotARN -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given resource. ARNs
                     uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources.  We  re-
                     quire  an  ARN  when you need to specify a resource unam-
                     biguously across all of Amazon Web Services. For more in-

                 CopyStrategy -> (string)
                     The strategy used when copying data from the snapshot  to
                     the new volume.

                     o CLONE  - The new volume references the data in the ori-
                       gin snapshot. Cloning a snapshot is faster than copying
                       the  data  from  a snapshot to a new volume and doesn't
                       consume disk throughput. However, the  origin  snapshot
                       can't  be deleted if there is a volume using its copied
                       data.

                     o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the  snapshot  to  the
                       new volume.

                     NOTE:
                        The  INCREMENTAL_COPY  option  is only for updating an
                        existing volume by using a snapshot from  another  FSx
                        for  OpenZFS  file  system.  For more information, see
                        CopySnapshotAndUpdateVolume .

              ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether the volume is read-only.

              NfsExports -> (list)
                 The configuration object for mounting a Network  File  System
                 (NFS) file system.

                 (structure)
                     The Network File System (NFS) configurations for mounting
                     an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.

                     ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                        A list  of  configuration  objects  that  contain  the
                        client  and options for mounting the OpenZFS file sys-
                        tem.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies who can mount an OpenZFS file system and
                            the options available while mounting the file sys-
                            tem.

                            Clients -> (string)
                               A value that specifies who can mount  the  file
                               system. You can provide a wildcard character (*
                               ), an IP address (0.0.0.0 ), or a CIDR  address
                               (192.0.2.0/24  ).  By  default, Amazon FSx uses
                               the  wildcard  character  when  specifying  the
                               client.

                            Options -> (list)
                               The  options to use when mounting the file sys-
                               tem. For a list of options  that  you  can  use
                               with   Network   File  System  (NFS),  see  the
                               exports(5) - Linux man  page  .  When  choosing
                               your options, consider the following:

                               o crossmnt  is  used  by  default. If you don't
                                 specify crossmnt  when  changing  the  client
                                 configuration,  you  won't  be able to see or
                                 access snapshots in your file system's  snap-
                                 shot directory.

                               o sync is used by default. If you instead spec-
                                 ify async , the  system  acknowledges  writes
                                 before writing to disk. If the system crashes
                                 before the writes are finished, you lose  the
                                 unwritten data.

                               (string)

              UserAndGroupQuotas -> (list)
                 An object specifying how much storage users or groups can use
                 on the volume.

                 (structure)
                     The configuration for how much storage a  user  or  group
                     can use on the volume.

                     Type -> (string)
                        A  value that specifies whether the quota applies to a
                        user or group.

                     Id -> (integer)
                        The ID of the user or group.

                     StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                        The amount of storage that the user or group  can  use
                        in gibibytes (GiB).

              RestoreToSnapshot -> (string)
                 Specifies  the ID of the snapshot to which the volume was re-
                 stored.

              DeleteIntermediateSnaphots -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether snapshots between the cur-
                 rent  state and the specified snapshot should be deleted when
                 a volume is restored from snapshot.

              DeleteClonedVolumes -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether  dependent  clone  volumes
                 created  from intermediate snapshots should be deleted when a
                 volume is restored from snapshot.

              DeleteIntermediateData -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether snapshot data that differs
                 between  the  current state and the specified snapshot should
                 be overwritten when a volume is restored from a snapshot.

              SourceSnapshotARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  a  given  resource.  ARNs
                 uniquely  identify  Amazon Web Services resources. We require
                 an ARN when you need  to  specify  a  resource  unambiguously
                 across  all of Amazon Web Services. For more information, see
                 Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services  Gen-
                 eral Reference .

              DestinationSnapshot -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the snapshot that's being copied or was most re-
                 cently copied to the destination volume.

              CopyStrategy -> (string)
                 Specifies the strategy used when copying data from the  snap-
                 shot to the new volume.

                 o CLONE  -  The  new volume references the data in the origin
                   snapshot. Cloning a snapshot is faster  than  copying  data
                   from  the snapshot to a new volume and doesn't consume disk
                   throughput. However, the origin snapshot can't  be  deleted
                   if there is a volume using its copied data.

                 o FULL_COPY  -  Copies  all data from the snapshot to the new
                   volume. Specify this option to create  the  volume  from  a
                   snapshot on another FSx for OpenZFS file system.

                 NOTE:
                     The  INCREMENTAL_COPY  option is only for updating an ex-
                     isting volume by using a snapshot from  another  FSx  for
                     OpenZFS   file   system.   For   more   information,  see
                     CopySnapshotAndUpdateVolume .
