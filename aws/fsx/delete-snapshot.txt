DELETE-SNAPSHOT()                                            DELETE-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       delete-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an  Amazon FSx for OpenZFS snapshot. After deletion, the snap-
       shot no longer exists, and  its  data  is  gone.  Deleting  a  snapshot
       doesn't affect snapshots stored in a file system backup.

       The  DeleteSnapshot  operation  returns instantly. The snapshot appears
       with the lifecycle status of DELETING until the deletion is complete.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-snapshot
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          --snapshot-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in  a  string
          of  up to 64 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the snapshot that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SnapshotId -> (string)
          The ID of the deleted snapshot.

       Lifecycle -> (string)
          The lifecycle status of the snapshot. If the  DeleteSnapshot  opera-
          tion is successful, this status is DELETING .
