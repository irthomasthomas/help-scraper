NAME
       update-data-repository-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the configuration of an existing data repository association on
       an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Data repository associations  are
       supported  on  all FSx for Lustre 2.12 and 2.15 file systems, excluding
       scratch_1 deployment type.

OPTIONS
       --association-id (string)
          The ID of the data repository association that you are updating.

       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in  a  string
          of  up to 63 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --imported-file-chunk-size (integer)
          For files imported from a data repository, this value determines the
          stripe count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored  on
          a  single  physical  disk. The maximum number of disks that a single
          file can be striped across is limited by the total number  of  disks
          that make up the file system.

          The  default  chunk  size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as
          512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum  size  of  5
          TB.

       --s3 (structure)
          The configuration for an Amazon S3 data repository linked to an Ama-
          zon FSx Lustre file system with a data repository  association.  The
          configuration  defines  which  file events (new, changed, or deleted
          files or directories) are automatically  imported  from  the  linked
          data  repository  to  the file system or automatically exported from
          the file system to the data repository.

          AutoImportPolicy -> (structure)
              Specifies the type of updated objects  (new,  changed,  deleted)
              that will be automatically imported from the linked S3 bucket to
              your file system.

              Events -> (list)
                 The AutoImportPolicy can have the following event values:

                 o NEW - Amazon FSx automatically imports  metadata  of  files
                   added  to  the linked S3 bucket that do not currently exist
                   in the FSx file system.

                 o CHANGED - Amazon FSx automatically  updates  file  metadata
                   and invalidates existing file content on the file system as
                   files change in the data repository.

                 o DELETED - Amazon FSx automatically  deletes  files  on  the
                   file  system as corresponding files are deleted in the data
                   repository.

                 You can define any combination of event types  for  your  Au-
                 toImportPolicy .

                 (string)

          AutoExportPolicy -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  type  of updated objects (new, changed, deleted)
              that will be automatically exported from your file system to the
              linked S3 bucket.

              Events -> (list)
                 The AutoExportPolicy can have the following event values:

                 o NEW  - New files and directories are automatically exported
                   to the data repository as they are added to the  file  sys-
                   tem.

                 o CHANGED - Changes to files and directories on the file sys-
                   tem are automatically exported to the data repository.

                 o DELETED - Files and directories are  automatically  deleted
                   on  the  data  repository when they are deleted on the file
                   system.

                 You can define any combination of event types for your  Auto-
                 ExportPolicy .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AutoImportPolicy={Events=[string,string]},AutoExportPolicy={Events=[string,string]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AutoImportPolicy": {
              "Events": ["NEW"|"CHANGED"|"DELETED", ...]
            },
            "AutoExportPolicy": {
              "Events": ["NEW"|"CHANGED"|"DELETED", ...]
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Association -> (structure)
          The  response  object returned after the data repository association
          is updated.

          AssociationId -> (string)
              The system-generated, unique ID of the data repository  associa-
              tion.

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a  given resource. ARNs
              uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources. We  require  an
              ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all
              of Amazon Web Services. For more  information,  see  Amazon  Re-
              source Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
              .

          FileSystemId -> (string)
              The globally unique ID of the file system,  assigned  by  Amazon
              FSx.

          Lifecycle -> (string)
              Describes  the state of a data repository association. The life-
              cycle can have the following values:

              o CREATING - The data repository association  between  the  file
                system  or cache and the data repository is being created. The
                data repository is unavailable.

              o AVAILABLE - The data repository association is  available  for
                use.

              o MISCONFIGURED  - The data repository association is misconfig-
                ured. Until the configuration is corrected,  automatic  import
                and  automatic  export  will not work (only for Amazon FSx for
                Lustre).

              o UPDATING - The data repository  association  is  undergoing  a
                customer initiated update that might affect its availability.

              o DELETING  -  The  data  repository association is undergoing a
                customer initiated deletion.

              o FAILED - The data repository  association  is  in  a  terminal
                state that cannot be recovered.

          FailureDetails -> (structure)
              Provides  detailed  information about the data repository if its
              Lifecycle is set to MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

              Message -> (string)
                 A detailed error message.

          FileSystemPath -> (string)
              A path on the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that points to a
              high-level  directory  (such as /ns1/ ) or subdirectory (such as
              /ns1/subdir/ ) that will be mapped 1-1 with DataRepositoryPath .
              The  leading  forward  slash  in  the name is required. Two data
              repository associations  cannot  have  overlapping  file  system
              paths. For example, if a data repository is associated with file
              system path /ns1/ , then you cannot link another data repository
              with file system path /ns1/ns2 .

              This  path specifies where in your file system files will be ex-
              ported from or imported to. This file system  directory  can  be
              linked  to only one Amazon S3 bucket, and no other S3 bucket can
              be linked to the directory.

              NOTE:
                 If you specify only a forward slash (/ ) as the  file  system
                 path,  you can link only one data repository to the file sys-
                 tem. You can only specify "/" as the file system path for the
                 first data repository associated with a file system.

          DataRepositoryPath -> (string)
              The path to the data repository that will be linked to the cache
              or file system.

              o For Amazon File Cache, the path can be an NFS data  repository
                that  will  be  linked to the cache. The path can be in one of
                two formats:

                o If you are not using the DataRepositorySubdirectories param-
                  eter,  the path is to an NFS Export directory (or one of its
                  subdirectories) in the format  nsf://nfs-domain-name/export-
                  path  . You can therefore link a single NFS Export to a sin-
                  gle data repository association.

                o If you are using the DataRepositorySubdirectories parameter,
                  the  path  is  the domain name of the NFS file system in the
                  format nfs://filer-domain-name , which indicates the root of
                  the  subdirectories  specified with the DataRepositorySubdi-
                  rectories parameter.

              o For Amazon File Cache, the path can be an S3 bucket or  prefix
                in the format s3://myBucket/myPrefix/ .

              o For  Amazon  FSx  for  Lustre, the path can be an S3 bucket or
                prefix in the format s3://myBucket/myPrefix/ .

          BatchImportMetaDataOnCreate -> (boolean)
              A boolean flag indicating whether an import data repository task
              to import metadata should run after the data repository associa-
              tion is created. The task runs if this flag is set to true .

              NOTE:
                 BatchImportMetaDataOnCreate is not supported for data reposi-
                 tories linked to an Amazon File Cache resource.

          ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
              For files imported from a data repository, this value determines
              the stripe count and maximum amount of data per  file  (in  MiB)
              stored  on  a  single physical disk. The maximum number of disks
              that a single file can be striped across is limited by the total
              number of disks that make up the file system or cache.

              The  default  chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high
              as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum  size
              of 5 TB.

          S3 -> (structure)
              The  configuration for an Amazon S3 data repository linked to an
              Amazon FSx for Lustre file system with a data repository associ-
              ation.

              AutoImportPolicy -> (structure)
                 Specifies the type of updated objects (new, changed, deleted)
                 that will be automatically imported from the linked S3 bucket
                 to your file system.

                 Events -> (list)
                     The AutoImportPolicy can have the following event values:

                     o NEW  -  Amazon  FSx  automatically  imports metadata of
                       files added to the linked S3 bucket that  do  not  cur-
                       rently exist in the FSx file system.

                     o CHANGED  -  Amazon FSx automatically updates file meta-
                       data and invalidates existing file content on the  file
                       system as files change in the data repository.

                     o DELETED - Amazon FSx automatically deletes files on the
                       file system as corresponding files are deleted  in  the
                       data repository.

                     You  can  define  any combination of event types for your
                     AutoImportPolicy .

                     (string)

              AutoExportPolicy -> (structure)
                 Specifies the type of updated objects (new, changed, deleted)
                 that  will be automatically exported from your file system to
                 the linked S3 bucket.

                 Events -> (list)
                     The AutoExportPolicy can have the following event values:

                     o NEW - New files and directories are  automatically  ex-
                       ported  to the data repository as they are added to the
                       file system.

                     o CHANGED - Changes to files and directories on the  file
                       system  are  automatically exported to the data reposi-
                       tory.

                     o DELETED  -  Files  and  directories  are  automatically
                       deleted on the data repository when they are deleted on
                       the file system.

                     You can define any combination of event  types  for  your
                     AutoExportPolicy .

                     (string)

          Tags -> (list)
              A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag.
                     Tag keys must be unique for the resource  to  which  they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned
                     to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and
                     don't  have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you
                     can have a key-value pair in a  tag  set  of  finances  :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that  the  resource  was  created,  in seconds (since
              1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

          FileCacheId -> (string)
              The globally unique ID of the Amazon File Cache resource.

          FileCachePath -> (string)
              A path on the Amazon File Cache that points to a high-level  di-
              rectory (such as /ns1/ ) or subdirectory (such as /ns1/subdir/ )
              that will be mapped 1-1 with DataRepositoryPath  .  The  leading
              forward slash in the path is required. Two data repository asso-
              ciations cannot have overlapping cache paths. For example, if  a
              data  repository  is associated with cache path /ns1/ , then you
              cannot link another data repository with cache path /ns1/ns2 .

              This path specifies the directory in your cache where files will
              be exported from. This cache directory can be linked to only one
              data repository (S3 or NFS) and no other data repository can  be
              linked to the directory.

              NOTE:
                 The cache path can only be set to root (/) on an NFS DRA when
                 DataRepositorySubdirectories is  specified.  If  you  specify
                 root  (/)  as  the cache path, you can create only one DRA on
                 the cache.

                 The cache path cannot be set to root (/) for an S3 DRA.

          DataRepositorySubdirectories -> (list)
              For Amazon File Cache, a list of NFS Exports that will be linked
              with  an NFS data repository association. All the subdirectories
              must be on a single NFS file system. The Export paths are in the
              format  /exportpath1 . To use this parameter, you must configure
              DataRepositoryPath as the domain name of the  NFS  file  system.
