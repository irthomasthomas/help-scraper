CREATE-FILE-CACHE()                                        CREATE-FILE-CACHE()



NAME
       create-file-cache -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new Amazon File Cache resource.

       You  can  use this operation with a client request token in the request
       that Amazon File Cache uses to ensure idempotent creation. If  a  cache
       with  the  specified  client  request  token  exists and the parameters
       match, CreateFileCache returns the description of the  existing  cache.
       If  a  cache with the specified client request token exists and the pa-
       rameters don't match, this call returns IncompatibleParameterError . If
       a  file  cache  with  the specified client request token doesn't exist,
       CreateFileCache does the following:

       o Creates a new, empty Amazon File Cache resourcewith an  assigned  ID,
         and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING .

       o Returns the description of the cache in JSON format.

       NOTE:
          The  CreateFileCache  call returns while the cache's lifecycle state
          is still CREATING . You can check the cache creation status by call-
          ing  the DescribeFileCaches operation, which returns the cache state
          along with other information.

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          An idempotency token for resource creation, in a string of up to  63
          ASCII  characters. This token is automatically filled on your behalf
          when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices SDK.

          By  using  the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateFileCache
          operation without the risk of creating an extra cache. This approach
          can  be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it un-
          clear whether a cache was created. Examples are if a transport level
          timeout  occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same
          client request token and the  initial  call  created  a  cache,  the
          client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.

       --file-cache-type (string)
          The type of cache that you're creating, which must be LUSTRE .

          Possible values:

          o LUSTRE

       --file-cache-type-version (string)
          Sets  the  Lustre  version for the cache that you're creating, which
          must be 2.12 .

       --storage-capacity (integer)
          The storage capacity of the cache in gibibytes (GiB).  Valid  values
          are 1200 GiB, 2400 GiB, and increments of 2400 GiB.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          A list of subnet IDs that the cache will be accessible from. You can
          specify only one subnet ID in a call to the  CreateFileCache  opera-
          tion.

          (string)
              The ID for a subnet. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your
              virtual private cloud (VPC). For more information, see  VPC  and
              subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --security-group-ids (list)
          A list of IDs specifying the security groups to apply to all network
          interfaces created for Amazon File Cache access. This list isn't re-
          turned in later requests to describe the cache.

          (string)
              The  ID  of  your  Amazon EC2 security group. This ID is used to
              control network access to the endpoint that Amazon  FSx  creates
              on  your behalf in each subnet. For more information, see Amazon
              EC2 Security groups for Linux instances in the Amazon  EC2  User
              Guide .

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag. Tag
                 keys must be unique for the resource to which  they  are  at-
                 tached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned to
                 the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and  don't
                 have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a
                 key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April and  also  of
                 payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

            }
            ...
          ]

       --copy-tags-to-data-repository-associations                           |
       --no-copy-tags-to-data-repository-associations (boolean)
          A boolean flag indicating whether  tags  for  the  cache  should  be

          false.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          Specifies the ID of the Key Management Service (KMS) key to use  for
          encrypting  data on an Amazon File Cache. If a KmsKeyId isn't speci-
          fied, the Amazon FSx-managed KMS key for your account is  used.  For
          more information, see Encrypt in the Key Management Service API Ref-
          erence .

       --lustre-configuration (structure)
          The configuration for the Amazon File Cache resource being created.

          PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
              Provisions the amount of read and write throughput  for  each  1
              tebibyte  (TiB) of cache storage capacity, in MB/s/TiB. The only
              supported value is 1000 .

          DeploymentType -> (string)
              Specifies the cache deployment type, which must be CACHE_1 .

          WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
              A recurring weekly time, in the format D:HH:MM .
                 D is the day of the week, for which 1 represents Monday and 7
                 represents Sunday. For further details, see the ISO-8601 spec
                 as described on Wikipedia .

                 HH is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM  is  the
                 zero-padded minute of the hour.

              For example, 1:05:00 specifies maintenance at 5 AM Monday.

          MetadataConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  configuration  for  a  Lustre MDT (Metadata Target) storage
              volume.

              StorageCapacity -> (integer)
                 The storage capacity of  the  Lustre  MDT  (Metadata  Target)
                 storage  volume  in gibibytes (GiB). The only supported value
                 is 2400 GiB.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PerUnitStorageThroughput=integer,DeploymentType=string,WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime=string,MetadataConfiguration={StorageCapacity=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PerUnitStorageThroughput": integer,
            "DeploymentType": "CACHE_1",
            "WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime": "string",
            "MetadataConfiguration": {
              "StorageCapacity": integer
            }
          }

       --data-repository-associations (list)
          A list of up to 8 configurations for  data  repository  associations
          (DRAs)  to  be  created during the cache creation. The DRAs link the
          cache to either an Amazon S3 data repository or a Network File  Sys-
          tem (NFS) data repository that supports the NFSv3 protocol.

          The DRA configurations must meet the following requirements:

          o All configurations on the list must be of the same data repository
            type, either all S3 or all NFS. A cache can't  link  to  different
            data repository types at the same time.

          o An NFS DRA must link to an NFS file system that supports the NFSv3
            protocol.

          DRA automatic import and automatic export is not supported.

          (structure)
              The configuration for a data repository association (DRA) to  be
              created  during the Amazon File Cache resource creation. The DRA
              links the cache to either an Amazon S3 bucket or  prefix,  or  a
              Network  File  System  (NFS)  data  repository that supports the
              NFSv3 protocol.

              The DRA does not support automatic import or automatic export.

              FileCachePath -> (string)
                 A path on the cache that points  to  a  high-level  directory
                 (such as /ns1/ ) or subdirectory (such as /ns1/subdir/ ) that
                 will be mapped 1-1 with DataRepositoryPath . The leading for-
                 ward slash in the name is required. Two data repository asso-
                 ciations cannot have overlapping cache paths. For example, if
                 a  data repository is associated with cache path /ns1/ , then
                 you cannot link  another  data  repository  with  cache  path
                 /ns1/ns2 .

                 This  path  specifies  where  in your cache files will be ex-
                 ported from. This cache directory can be linked to  only  one
                 data  repository,  and no data repository other can be linked
                 to the directory.

                 NOTE:
                     The cache path can only be set to root (/) on an NFS  DRA
                     when  DataRepositorySubdirectories  is  specified. If you
                     specify root (/) as the cache path, you can  create  only
                     one DRA on the cache.

                     The cache path cannot be set to root (/) for an S3 DRA.

              DataRepositoryPath -> (string)
                 The  path  to the S3 or NFS data repository that links to the
                 cache. You must provide one of the following paths:

                 o The path can be an NFS data repository that  links  to  the
                   cache. The path can be in one of two formats:

                   o If you are not using the DataRepositorySubdirectories pa-
                     rameter, the path is to an NFS Export directory  (or  one
                     of   its  subdirectories)  in  the  format  nfs://nfs-do-
                     main-name/exportpath . You can therefore  link  a  single
                     NFS Export to a single data repository association.

                   o If you are using the DataRepositorySubdirectories parame-
                     ter, the path is the domain name of the NFS  file  system
                     in  the  format nfs://filer-domain-name , which indicates
                     the  root  of  the  subdirectories  specified  with   the
                     DataRepositorySubdirectories parameter.

                 o The  path  can  be  an  S3  bucket  or prefix in the format
                   s3://myBucket/myPrefix/ .

              DataRepositorySubdirectories -> (list)
                 A list of NFS Exports that will  be  linked  with  this  data
                 repository  association.  The  Export paths are in the format
                 /exportpath1 . To use  this  parameter,  you  must  configure
                 DataRepositoryPath as the domain name of the NFS file system.
                 The NFS file system domain name in effect is the root of  the
                 subdirectories. Note that DataRepositorySubdirectories is not
                 supported for S3 data repositories.

                 (string)

              NFS -> (structure)
                 The configuration for  a  data  repository  association  that
                 links  an  Amazon  File Cache resource to an NFS data reposi-
                 tory.

                 Version -> (string)
                     The version of the NFS (Network File System) protocol  of
                     the NFS data repository. The only supported value is NFS3
                     , which indicates that the data repository  must  support
                     the NFSv3 protocol.

                 DnsIps -> (list)
                     A list of up to 2 IP addresses of DNS servers used to re-
                     solve the NFS file system domain name.  The  provided  IP
                     addresses  can  either  be the IP addresses of a DNS for-
                     warder or resolver that the customer manages and runs in-
                     side  the  customer  VPC,  or  the  IP  addresses  of the
                     on-premises DNS servers.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              Specifies the ID of the Key Management Service (KMS) key to  use
              for encrypting data on an Amazon File Cache. If a KmsKeyId isn't
              specified, the Amazon FSx-managed KMS key for  your  account  is
              used.  For  more  information, see Encrypt in the Key Management
              Service API Reference .

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a  given  resource.  ARNs
              uniquely  identify  Amazon Web Services resources. We require an
              ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all
              of  Amazon  Web  Services.  For more information, see Amazon Re-
              source Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
              .

                 Key -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag.
                     Tag keys must be unique for the resource  to  which  they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned
                     to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and
                     don't  have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you
                     can have a key-value pair in a  tag  set  of  finances  :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

          CopyTagsToDataRepositoryAssociations -> (boolean)
              A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags for the cache should be
              copied to data repository associations.

                 ond  of  read  or  write throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage
                 provisioned. Cache throughput capacity is  equal  to  Storage
                 capacity  (TiB)  *  PerUnitStorageThroughput  (MB/s/TiB). The
                 only supported value is 1000 .

              DeploymentType -> (string)
                 The deployment type of the Amazon File Cache resource,  which
                 must be CACHE_1 .

              MountName -> (string)
                 You  use  the MountName value when mounting the cache. If you
                 pass a cache ID to the DescribeFileCaches operation,  it  re-
                 turns the the MountName value as part of the cache's descrip-
                 tion.

              WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                 A recurring weekly time, in the format D:HH:MM .
                     D is the day of the week, for which 1  represents  Monday
                     and  7  represents  Sunday.  For further details, see the
                     ISO-8601 spec as described on Wikipedia .

                     HH is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and  MM  is
                     the zero-padded minute of the hour.

                 For example, 1:05:00 specifies maintenance at 5 AM Monday.

              MetadataConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  configuration for a Lustre MDT (Metadata Target) storage
                 volume.

                 StorageCapacity -> (integer)
                     The storage capacity of the Lustre MDT (Metadata  Target)
                     storage  volume  in  gibibytes  (GiB). The only supported
                     value is 2400 GiB.

                     o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                     o WARN_ERROR - both warning events and error  events  are
                       logged.

                     o DISABLED  - logging of data repository events is turned
                       off.

                     Note that Amazon File Cache uses  a  default  setting  of
                     WARN_ERROR , which can't be changed.

                 Destination -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the desti-
                     nation of the logs. The destination  can  be  any  Amazon
                     CloudWatch  Logs  log group ARN. The destination ARN must
                     be in the same Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon  Web
                     Services  Region, and Amazon Web Services account as your
                     Amazon FSx file system.
