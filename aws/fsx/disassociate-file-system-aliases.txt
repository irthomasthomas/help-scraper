DISASSOCIATE-FILE-SYSTEM-ALIASES()          DISASSOCIATE-FILE-SYSTEM-ALIASES()



NAME
       disassociate-file-system-aliases -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this  action  to  disassociate, or remove, one or more Domain Name
       Service (DNS) aliases from an Amazon FSx for Windows File  Server  file
       system.  If you attempt to disassociate a DNS alias that is not associ-
       ated with the file system, Amazon FSx responds with a 400 Bad  Request.
       For more information, see Working with DNS Aliases .

       The  system  generated response showing the DNS aliases that Amazon FSx
       is attempting to disassociate from the file system. Use the API  opera-
       tion  to monitor the status of the aliases Amazon FSx is disassociating
       with the file system.

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in  a  string
          of  up to 64 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --file-system-id (string)
          Specifies  the  file  system  from  which  to  disassociate  the DNS
          aliases.

       --aliases (list)
          An array of one or more DNS alias names to disassociate, or  remove,
          from the file system.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Aliases -> (list)
          An array of one or more DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is attempting to
          disassociate from the file system.

          (structure)
              A DNS alias that is associated with the file system. You can use
              a DNS alias to access  a  file  system  using  user-defined  DNS
              names,  in  addition to the default DNS name that Amazon FSx as-
              signs to the file system. For more information, see DNS  aliases
              in the FSx for Windows File Server User Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  DNS alias. The alias name has to meet the
                 following requirements:

                 o Formatted as a fully-qualified domain  name  (FQDN),  host-
                   name.domain , for example, accounting.example.com .

                 o Can  contain  alphanumeric  characters, the underscore (_),
                   and the hyphen (-).

                 o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

                 o Can start with a numeric.

                 For DNS names, Amazon FSx  stores  alphabetic  characters  as
                 lowercase  letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them:
                 as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding
                 letters in escape codes.

              Lifecycle -> (string)
                 Describes the state of the DNS alias.

                 o AVAILABLE  - The DNS alias is associated with an Amazon FSx
                   file system.

                 o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS alias and associ-
                   ating it with the file system.

                 o CREATE_FAILED  - Amazon FSx was unable to associate the DNS
                   alias with the file system.

                 o DELETING - Amazon FSx is disassociating the DNS alias  from
                   the file system and deleting it.

                 o DELETE_FAILED  -  Amazon FSx was unable to disassociate the
                   DNS alias from the file system.
