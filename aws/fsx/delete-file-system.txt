DELETE-FILE-SYSTEM()                                      DELETE-FILE-SYSTEM()



NAME
       delete-file-system -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  file  system. After deletion, the file system no longer ex-
       ists, and its data is gone. Any existing automatic  backups  and  snap-
       shots are also deleted.

       To  delete an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system, first delete all
       the volumes and storage virtual machines (SVMs)  on  the  file  system.
       Then provide a FileSystemId value to the DeleFileSystem operation.

       By  default, when you delete an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file
       system, a final backup is created  upon  deletion.  This  final  backup
       isn't  subject to the file system's retention policy, and must be manu-
       ally deleted.

       The DeleteFileSystem operation returns while the file  system  has  the
       DELETING status. You can check the file system deletion status by call-
       ing the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns  a  list  of  file
       systems  in  your account. If you pass the file system ID for a deleted
       file system, the DescribeFileSystems operation returns a FileSystemNot-
       Found error.

       NOTE:
          If a data repository task is in a PENDING or EXECUTING state, delet-
          ing an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system will fail with an HTTP sta-
          tus code 400 (Bad Request).

       WARNING:
          The  data  in a deleted file system is also deleted and can't be re-
          covered by any means.

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the file system that you want to delete.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure
          idempotent  deletion. This token is automatically filled on your be-
          half when using the Command Line Interface (CLI) or  an  Amazon  Web
          Services SDK.

       --windows-configuration (structure)
          The  configuration object for the Microsoft Windows file system used
          in the DeleteFileSystem operation.

          SkipFinalBackup -> (boolean)
              By default, Amazon FSx for Windows takes a final backup on  your
              behalf  when  the  DeleteFileSystem  operation is invoked. Doing
              this helps protect you from data loss, and we  highly  recommend
              taking  the  final  backup. If you want to skip this backup, use
              this flag to do so.

          FinalBackupTags -> (list)
              A set of tags for your final backup.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the  tag.
                     Tag  keys  must  be unique for the resource to which they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagValue , the value  assigned
                     to  the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and
                     don't have to be unique in a tag set.  For  example,  you
                     can  have  a  key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SkipFinalBackup=boolean,FinalBackupTags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SkipFinalBackup": true|false,
            "FinalBackupTags": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --lustre-configuration (structure)
          The configuration object for the Amazon FSx for Lustre  file  system
          being deleted in the DeleteFileSystem operation.

          SkipFinalBackup -> (boolean)
              Set  SkipFinalBackup to false if you want to take a final backup
              of the file system you are deleting. By default, Amazon FSx will
              not take a final backup on your behalf when the DeleteFileSystem
              operation is invoked. (Default = true)

              NOTE:
                 The fsx:CreateBackup permission is required if you set  Skip-
                 FinalBackup  to  false in order to delete the file system and
                 take a final backup.

          FinalBackupTags -> (list)
              Use if SkipFinalBackup is set to false , and you want  to  apply
              an  array  of tags to the final backup. If you have set the file
              system property CopyTagsToBackups to true, and you  specify  one
              or  more FinalBackupTags when deleting a file system, Amazon FSx
              will not copy any existing file system tags to the backup.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the  tag.
                     Tag  keys  must  be unique for the resource to which they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagValue , the value  assigned
                     to  the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and
                     don't have to be unique in a tag set.  For  example,  you
                     can  have  a  key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

          The configuration object for the OpenZFS file  system  used  in  the
          DeleteFileSystem operation.

          SkipFinalBackup -> (boolean)
              By  default, Amazon FSx for OpenZFS takes a final backup on your
              behalf when the DeleteFileSystem  operation  is  invoked.  Doing
              this  helps  protect you from data loss, and we highly recommend
              taking the final backup. If you want  to  skip  taking  a  final
              backup, set this value to true .

          FinalBackupTags -> (list)
              A list of tags to apply to the file system's final backup.

              (structure)

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned
                     to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and
                     don't  have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you
                     can have a key-value pair in a  tag  set  of  finances  :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

          Options -> (list)
              To delete a file system if there are child volumes present below
              the root volume, use the  string  DELETE_CHILD_VOLUMES_AND_SNAP-
              SHOTS  . If your file system has child volumes and you don't use
              this option, the delete request will fail.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
