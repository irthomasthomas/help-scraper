DESCRIBE-FILE-CACHES()                                  DESCRIBE-FILE-CACHES()



NAME
       describe-file-caches -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the description of a specific Amazon File Cache resource, if a
       FileCacheIds value is provided for that cache.  Otherwise,  it  returns
       descriptions of all caches owned by your Amazon Web Services account in
       the Amazon Web Services Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

       When retrieving all cache descriptions, you can optionally specify  the
       MaxResults parameter to limit the number of descriptions in a response.
       If more cache descriptions remain, the operation  returns  a  NextToken
       value  in  the  response.  In  this case, send a later request with the
       NextToken request parameter set to the value of NextToken from the last
       response.

       This  operation  is  used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of
       your cache descriptions. DescribeFileCaches is called first  without  a
       NextToken  value.  Then  the  operation continues to be called with the
       NextToken parameter set to the value of the last NextToken value  until
       a response has no NextToken .

       When using this operation, keep the following in mind:

       o The  implementation might return fewer than MaxResults cache descrip-
         tions while still including a NextToken value.

       o The order of caches returned in the  response  of  one  DescribeFile-
         Caches  call and the order of caches returned across the responses of
         a multicall iteration is unspecified.

OPTIONS
       --file-cache-ids (list)
          IDs of the caches whose descriptions you want to retrieve (String).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of resources to  return  in  the  response.  This
          value must be an integer greater than zero.

       --next-token (string)
          (Optional)  Opaque  pagination token returned from a previous opera-
          tion (String). If present, this token indicates from what point  you
          can  continue  processing  the request, where the previous NextToken
          value left off.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 use for encrypting  data  on  an  Amazon  File  Cache.  If  a
                 KmsKeyId  isn't specified, the Amazon FSx-managed KMS key for
                 your account is used. For more information,  see  Encrypt  in
                 the Key Management Service API Reference .

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for a given resource. ARNs
                 uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources.  We  require
                 an  ARN  when  you  need  to specify a resource unambiguously
                 across all of Amazon Web Services. For more information,  see
                 Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services Gen-
                 eral Reference .

                 The configuration for the Amazon File Cache resource.

                 PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                     Per unit storage throughput represents the megabytes  per
                     second  of  read  or  write  throughput per 1 tebibyte of
                     storage provisioned. Cache throughput capacity  is  equal
                     to  Storage  capacity  (TiB)  *  PerUnitStorageThroughput
                     (MB/s/TiB). The only supported value is 1000 .

                 DeploymentType -> (string)

                 MountName -> (string)
                     You  use  the MountName value when mounting the cache. If
                     you pass a cache ID to the DescribeFileCaches  operation,
                     it returns the the MountName value as part of the cache's
                     description.

                 WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                     A recurring weekly time, in the format D:HH:MM .
                        D is the day of the week, for which 1 represents  Mon-
                        day  and 7 represents Sunday. For further details, see
                        the ISO-8601 spec as described on Wikipedia .

                        HH is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23),  and  MM
                        is the zero-padded minute of the hour.

                     For  example,  1:05:00 specifies maintenance at 5 AM Mon-
                     day.

                 MetadataConfiguration -> (structure)

                     StorageCapacity -> (integer)
                        The  storage capacity of the Lustre MDT (Metadata Tar-
                        get) storage volume in gibibytes (GiB). The only  sup-
                        ported value is 2400 GiB.

                 LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The  configuration  for  Lustre logging used to write the
                     enabled logging events for your  Amazon  File  Cache  re-
                     source to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                     Level -> (string)
                        The  data  repository events that are logged by Amazon
                        FSx.

                        o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                        o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                        o WARN_ERROR - both warning events  and  error  events
                          are logged.

                        o DISABLED  -  logging  of  data  repository events is
                          turned off.

                        Note that Amazon File Cache uses a default setting  of
                        WARN_ERROR , which can't be changed.

                     Destination -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the des-
                        tination of the logs. The destination can be any  Ama-
                        zon CloudWatch Logs log group ARN. The destination ARN
                        must be in the same  Amazon  Web  Services  partition,
                        Amazon  Web  Services  Region, and Amazon Web Services
                        account as your Amazon FSx file system.

              DataRepositoryAssociationIds -> (list)
                 A list of IDs of data repository associations that are  asso-
                 ciated with this cache.

                 (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          (Optional)  Opaque  pagination token returned from a previous opera-
          tion (String). If present, this token indicates from what point  you
          can  continue  processing  the request, where the previous NextToken
          value left off.
