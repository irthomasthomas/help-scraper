LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()                              LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()



NAME
       list-tags-for-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists tags for Amazon FSx resources.

       When retrieving all tags, you can optionally specify the MaxResults pa-
       rameter to limit the number of tags in a response. If more tags remain,
       Amazon  FSx  returns  a  NextToken value in the response. In this case,
       send a later request with the NextToken request parameter  set  to  the
       value of NextToken from the last response.

       This  action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your
       tags. ListTagsForResource is called first without  a  NextToken  value.
       Then the action continues to be called with the NextToken parameter set
       to the value of the last NextToken value until a response has no  Next-
       Token .

       When using this action, keep the following in mind:

       o The implementation might return fewer than MaxResults file system de-
         scriptions while still including a NextToken value.

       o The order of tags returned in the response of one ListTagsForResource
         call  and  the  order  of  tags  returned  across  the responses of a
         multi-call iteration is unspecified.

       list-tags-for-resource is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Tags

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Amazon FSx resource that will have its tags listed.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Tags -> (list)
          A list of tags on the resource.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag. Tag
                 keys must be unique for the resource to which  they  are  at-
                 tached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned to
                 the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and  don't
                 have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a
                 key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April and  also  of
                 payroll : April .

       NextToken -> (string)
          This is present if there are more tags than returned in the response
          (String). You can use the NextToken value in the  later  request  to
          fetch the tags.
