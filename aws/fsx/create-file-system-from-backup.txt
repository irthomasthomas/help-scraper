CREATE-FILE-SYSTEM-FROM-BACKUP()              CREATE-FILE-SYSTEM-FROM-BACKUP()



NAME
       create-file-system-from-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  Amazon  FSx  for  Lustre,  Amazon FSx for Windows File
       Server, or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system from an  existing  Amazon
       FSx backup.

       If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the
       parameters match, this operation returns the description  of  the  file
       system. If a file system with the specified client request token exists
       but the parameters don't match, this call  returns  IncompatibleParame-
       terError  .  If  a  file system with the specified client request token
       doesn't exist, this operation does the following:

       o Creates a new Amazon FSx file system from backup with an assigned ID,
         and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING .

       o Returns the description of the file system.

       Parameters  like  the  Active  Directory, default share name, automatic
       backup, and backup settings default to the parameters of the file  sys-
       tem  that  was  backed up, unless overridden. You can explicitly supply
       other settings.

       By using the idempotent operation, you can  retry  a  CreateFileSystem-
       FromBackup call without the risk of creating an extra file system. This
       approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way  that  makes
       it  unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a trans-
       port level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If  you  use
       the  same client request token and the initial call created a file sys-
       tem, the client receives a success message as long  as  the  parameters
       are the same.

       NOTE:
          The  CreateFileSystemFromBackup call returns while the file system's
          lifecycle state is still CREATING . You can  check  the  file-system
          creation  status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which
          returns the file system state along with other information.

OPTIONS
       --backup-id (string)
          The ID of the source backup. Specifies the backup that you are copy-
          ing.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A string of up to 63 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure
          idempotent creation. This string is automatically filled on your be-
          half  when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Amazon Web
          Services SDK.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          Specifies the IDs of the subnets that the file system will be acces-
          sible  from.  For  Windows  MULTI_AZ_1 file system deployment types,
          provide exactly two subnet IDs, one for the  preferred  file  server
          and  one  for the standby file server. You specify one of these sub-
          nets as the preferred subnet using the WindowsConfiguration  >  Pre-
          ferredSubnetID property.

          Windows  SINGLE_AZ_1  and  SINGLE_AZ_2 file system deployment types,
          Lustre file systems, and OpenZFS file systems  provide  exactly  one
          subnet ID. The file server is launched in that subnet's Availability
          Zone.

          (string)
              The ID for a subnet. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your
              virtual  private  cloud (VPC). For more information, see VPC and
              subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --security-group-ids (list)
          A list of IDs for the security groups that apply  to  the  specified
          network  interfaces  created  for file system access. These security
          groups apply to all network interfaces. This value isn't returned in
          later DescribeFileSystem requests.

          (string)
              The  ID  of  your  Amazon EC2 security group. This ID is used to
              control network access to the endpoint that Amazon  FSx  creates
              on  your behalf in each subnet. For more information, see Amazon
              EC2 Security groups for Linux instances in the Amazon  EC2  User
              Guide .

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The  tags  to be applied to the file system at file system creation.
          The key value of the Name tag appears in the  console  as  the  file
          system name.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag. Tag
                 keys must be unique for the resource to which  they  are  at-
                 tached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned to
                 the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and  don't
                 have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a
                 key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April and  also  of
                 payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

              The ID for an existing Amazon Web Services Managed Microsoft Ac-
              tive Directory (AD) instance that the file  system  should  join
              when it's created.

          SelfManagedActiveDirectoryConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration that Amazon FSx uses to join a FSx for Windows
              File Server file system or an FSx for ONTAP storage virtual  ma-
              chine  (SVM) to a self-managed (including on-premises) Microsoft
              Active Directory (AD) directory. For more information, see Using
              Amazon  FSx  for Windows with your self-managed Microsoft Active
              Directory or Managing FSx for ONTAP SVMs .

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The fully qualified domain name of the self-managed AD direc-
                 tory, such as corp.example.com .

              OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName -> (string)
                 (Optional)  The fully qualified distinguished name of the or-
                 ganizational unit within your self-managed AD directory. Ama-
                 zon FSx only accepts OU as the direct parent of the file sys-
                 tem. An example is OU=FSx,DC=yourdomain,DC=corp,DC=com  .  To
                 learn  more, see RFC 2253 . If none is provided, the FSx file
                 system is created in the default location of  your  self-man-
                 aged AD directory.

                 WARNING:
                     Only  Organizational  Unit (OU) objects can be the direct
                     parent of the file system that you're creating.

              FileSystemAdministratorsGroup -> (string)
                 (Optional) The name of the domain  group  whose  members  are
                 granted administrative privileges for the file system. Admin-
                 istrative privileges include taking ownership  of  files  and
                 folders,  setting  audit  controls  (audit ACLs) on files and
                 folders, and administering the file system remotely by  using
                 the  FSx  Remote  PowerShell. The group that you specify must
                 already exist in your domain. If you don't provide one,  your
                 AD domain's Domain Admins group is used.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The user name for the service account on your self-managed AD
                 domain that Amazon FSx will use to join to  your  AD  domain.
                 This  account  must  have the permission to join computers to
                 the domain in the organizational unit provided  in  Organiza-
                 tionalUnitDistinguishedName  ,  or in the default location of
                 your AD domain.

              Password -> (string)
                 The password for the service account on your self-managed  AD
                 domain that Amazon FSx will use to join to your AD domain.

              DnsIps -> (list)
                 A  list  of up to three IP addresses of DNS servers or domain
                 controllers in the self-managed AD directory.

                 (string)

          DeploymentType -> (string)
              Specifies the file system deployment type, valid values are  the
              following:

              o MULTI_AZ_1  -  Deploys a high availability file system that is
                configured  for  Multi-AZ  redundancy  to  tolerate  temporary
                Availability  Zone  (AZ) unavailability. You can only deploy a
                Multi-AZ file system in Amazon Web Services Regions that  have
                a minimum of three Availability Zones. Also supports HDD stor-
                age type

              o SINGLE_AZ_1 - (Default) Choose to deploy a file system that is
                configured for single AZ redundancy.

              o SINGLE_AZ_2  -  The  latest  generation Single AZ file system.
                Specifies a file system that is configured for single  AZ  re-
                dundancy and supports HDD storage type.

              For more information, see Availability and Durability: Single-AZ
              and Multi-AZ File Systems .

          PreferredSubnetId -> (string)
              Required when DeploymentType is set to MULTI_AZ_1 . This  speci-
              fies  the  subnet in which you want the preferred file server to
              be located. For in-Amazon Web Services applications,  we  recom-
              mend  that you launch your clients in the same Availability Zone
              (AZ) as your preferred  file  server  to  reduce  cross-AZ  data
              transfer costs and minimize latency.

          ThroughputCapacity -> (integer)
              Sets  the throughput capacity of an Amazon FSx file system, mea-
              sured in megabytes per second (MB/s), in 2 to the  n  th  incre-
              ments, between 2^3 (8) and 2^11 (2048).

          WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
              The  preferred start time to perform weekly maintenance, format-
              ted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone, where d is the weekday number,
              from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.

          DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
              The  preferred  time  to take daily automatic backups, formatted
              HH:MM in the UTC time zone.

          AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
              The number of days to retain  automatic  backups.  Setting  this
              property  to  0 disables automatic backups. You can retain auto-
              matic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 30 .

          CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
              A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags  for  the  file  system
              should  be  copied  to backups. This value defaults to false. If
              it's set to true, all tags for the file system are copied to all
              automatic  and  user-initiated  backups  where  the user doesn't
              specify tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or more
              tags,  only  the  specified  tags  are copied to backups. If you
              specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated  backup,
              no  tags  are  copied  from  the file system, regardless of this
              value.

          Aliases -> (list)
              An array of one or more DNS alias names that you want  to  asso-
              ciate  with the Amazon FSx file system. Aliases allow you to use
              existing DNS names to access the data in your  Amazon  FSx  file
              system. You can associate up to 50 aliases with a file system at
              any time. You can associate additional  DNS  aliases  after  you
              create  the file system using the AssociateFileSystemAliases op-
              eration. You can remove DNS aliases from the file  system  after
              it is created using the DisassociateFileSystemAliases operation.
              You only need to specify the alias name in the request payload.

              For  more  information,  see  Working  with  DNS   Aliases   and
              Walkthrough  5:  Using  DNS aliases to access your file system ,
              including additional steps you must take to be  able  to  access
              your file system using a DNS alias.

              An alias name has to meet the following requirements:

              o Formatted  as  a  fully-qualified  domain  name  (FQDN), host-
                name.domain , for example, accounting.example.com .

              o Can contain alphanumeric characters, the underscore  (_),  and
                the hyphen (-).

              o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

              o Can start with a numeric.

              For  DNS alias names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as
              lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them:  as
              uppercase  letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding let-
              ters in escape codes.

              (string)

          AuditLogConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration that Amazon FSx for Windows File  Server  uses
              to  audit  and  log  user  accesses  of files, folders, and file
              shares on the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system.

              FileAccessAuditLogLevel -> (string)
                 Sets which attempt type is logged by Amazon FSx for file  and
                 folder accesses.

                 o SUCCESS_ONLY  - only successful attempts to access files or
                   folders are logged.

                 o FAILURE_ONLY - only failed  attempts  to  access  files  or
                   folders are logged.

                 o SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE  -  both successful attempts and failed
                   attempts to access files or folders are logged.

                 o DISABLED - access auditing of files and folders  is  turned
                   off.

              FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel -> (string)
                 Sets  which  attempt  type  is  logged by Amazon FSx for file
                 share accesses.

                 o SUCCESS_ONLY - only  successful  attempts  to  access  file
                   shares are logged.

                 o FAILURE_ONLY  -  only failed attempts to access file shares
                   are logged.

                 o SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE - both successful attempts  and  failed
                   attempts to access file shares are logged.

                 o DISABLED - access auditing of file shares is turned off.

              AuditLogDestination -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the destination
                 of the audit logs.

                 The destination can be any Amazon CloudWatch Logs  log  group
                 ARN or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream ARN, with
                 the following requirements:

                 o The destination ARN that  you  provide  (either  CloudWatch
                   Logs  log  group  or Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream)
                   must be in the same Amazon Web Services  partition,  Amazon
                   Web  Services  Region,  and  Amazon Web Services account as
                   your Amazon FSx file system.

                 o The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must begin
                   with  the  /aws/fsx  prefix. The name of the Amazon Kinesis
                   Data Firehouse delivery stream must begin with the  aws-fsx
                   prefix.

                 o If  you do not provide a destination in AuditLogDestination
                   , Amazon FSx will create and use a log stream in the Cloud-
                   Watch Logs /aws/fsx/windows log group.

                 o If  AuditLogDestination  is  provided and the resource does
                   not exist, the request will fail with a BadRequest error.

                 o If FileAccessAuditLogLevel and FileShareAccessAuditLogLevel
                   are both set to DISABLED , you cannot specify a destination
                   in AuditLogDestination .

            }
          }

       --lustre-configuration (structure)
          The Lustre configuration for the file system being created.

          NOTE:
              The following parameters are not supported for file systems with
              a data repository association created with .

              o AutoImportPolicy

              o ExportPath

              o ImportedChunkSize

              o ImportPath

          WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
              (Optional)  The  preferred  start time to perform weekly mainte-
              nance, formatted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone, where  d  is  the
              weekday number, from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and end-
              ing with Sunday.

          ImportPath -> (string)
              (Optional) The path to the Amazon S3 bucket (including  the  op-
              tional prefix) that you're using as the data repository for your
              Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. The root of your FSx for Lus-
              tre  file  system  will  be  mapped to the root of the Amazon S3
              bucket  you  select.  An   example   is   s3://import-bucket/op-
              tional-prefix  .  If  you  specify  a prefix after the Amazon S3
              bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are  loaded  into
              the file system.

              NOTE:
                 This  parameter is not supported for file systems with a data
                 repository association.

          ExportPath -> (string)
              (Optional) Specifies the path in the Amazon S3 bucket where  the
              root  of  your Amazon FSx file system is exported. The path must
              use the same Amazon S3 bucket as specified  in  ImportPath.  You
              can  provide an optional prefix to which new and changed data is
              to be exported from your Amazon FSx for Lustre file  system.  If
              an  ExportPath  value is not provided, Amazon FSx sets a default
              export path, s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp]  .
              The   timestamp   is   in   UTC  format,  for  example  s3://im-
              port-bucket/FSxLustre20181105T222312Z .

              The Amazon S3 export bucket must  be  the  same  as  the  import
              bucket  specified  by  ImportPath . If you specify only a bucket
              name, such as s3://import-bucket , you get a 1:1 mapping of file
              system objects to S3 bucket objects. This mapping means that the
              input data in S3 is overwritten on export. If you provide a cus-
              tom  prefix in the export path, such as s3://import-bucket/[cus-
              tom-optional-prefix] , Amazon FSx exports the contents  of  your
              file system to that export prefix in the Amazon S3 bucket.

              NOTE:
                 This  parameter is not supported for file systems with a data
                 repository association.

          ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
              (Optional) For files imported from a data repository, this value
              determines  the stripe count and maximum amount of data per file
              (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum number of
              disks that a single file can be striped across is limited by the
              total number of disks that make up the file system.

              The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go  as  high
              as  512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size
              of 5 TB.

              NOTE:
                 This parameter is not supported for file systems with a  data
                 repository association.

          DeploymentType -> (string)
              (Optional)  Choose SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2 deployment types when
              you need temporary storage and shorter-term processing of  data.
              The  SCRATCH_2 deployment type provides in-transit encryption of
              data and higher burst throughput capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

              Choose PERSISTENT_1 for longer-term  storage  and  for  through-
              put-focused workloads that arent latency-sensitive. PERSISTENT_1
              supports encryption of data in transit, and is available in  all
              Amazon  Web  Services  Regions in which FSx for Lustre is avail-
              able.

              Choose PERSISTENT_2 for longer-term storage and for latency-sen-
              sitive   workloads   that   require   the   highest   levels  of
              IOPS/throughput. PERSISTENT_2 supports SSD storage,  and  offers
              higher  PerUnitStorageThroughput  (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB). PERSIS-
              TENT_2 is available in a limited number of Amazon  Web  Services
              Regions.  For more information, and an up-to-date list of Amazon
              Web Services Regions in which  PERSISTENT_2  is  available,  see
              File  system deployment options for FSx for Lustre in the Amazon
              FSx for Lustre User Guide .

              NOTE:
                 If you choose PERSISTENT_2 , and you  set  FileSystemTypeVer-
                 sion to 2.10 , the CreateFileSystem operation fails.

              Encryption  of  data  in transit is automatically turned on when
              you access SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2  file  sys-
              tems from Amazon EC2 instances that support automatic encryption
              in the Amazon Web Services Regions where they are available. For
              more  information about encryption in transit for FSx for Lustre
              file systems, see Encrypting data in transit in the  Amazon  FSx
              for Lustre User Guide .

              (Default = SCRATCH_1 )

          AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
              (Optional)  When  you  create your file system, your existing S3
              objects appear as file and directory listings. Use this  parame-
              ter to choose how Amazon FSx keeps your file and directory list-
              ings up to date as you add or modify objects in your  linked  S3
              bucket. AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

              o NONE  -  (Default)  AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only updates
                file and directory listings from the linked S3 bucket when the
                file system is created. FSx does not update file and directory
                listings for any new or changed objects  after  choosing  this
                option.

              o NEW  -  AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports di-
                rectory listings of any new objects added  to  the  linked  S3
                bucket that do not currently exist in the FSx file system.

              o NEW_CHANGED  -  AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically im-
                ports file and directory listings of any new objects added  to
                the S3 bucket and any existing objects that are changed in the
                S3 bucket after you choose this option.

              o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED - AutoImport is on. Amazon  FSx  automati-
                cally  imports  file and directory listings of any new objects
                added to the S3 bucket, any existing objects that are  changed
                in  the S3 bucket, and any objects that were deleted in the S3
                bucket.

              For more information, see Automatically import updates from your
              S3 bucket .

              NOTE:
                 This  parameter is not supported for file systems with a data
                 repository association.

          PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
              Required with PERSISTENT_1 and  PERSISTENT_2  deployment  types,
              provisions  the  amount  of read and write throughput for each 1
              tebibyte (TiB) of file system  storage  capacity,  in  MB/s/TiB.
              File  system throughput capacity is calculated by multiplying le
              system storage capacity (TiB)  by  the  PerUnitStorageThroughput
              (MB/s/TiB). For a 2.4-TiB le system, provisioning 50 MB/s/TiB of
              PerUnitStorageThroughput yields 120 MB/s of le  system  through-
              put. You pay for the amount of throughput that you provision.

              Valid values:

              o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200 MB/s/TiB.

              o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40 MB/s/TiB.

              o For PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage: 125, 250, 500, 1000 MB/s/TiB.

          DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
              A  recurring  daily  time,  in  the  format  HH:MM  .  HH is the
              zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM  is  the  zero-padded
              minute of the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

          AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
              The  number  of  days  to retain automatic backups. Setting this
              property to 0 disables automatic backups. You can  retain  auto-
              matic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

          CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
              (Optional)  Not  available  for  use  with file systems that are
              linked to a data repository. A boolean flag  indicating  whether
              tags  for  the  file system should be copied to backups. The de-
              fault value is false. If CopyTagsToBackups is set to  true,  all
              file  system tags are copied to all automatic and user-initiated
              backups when the user doesn't specify any backup-specific  tags.
              If  CopyTagsToBackups is set to true and you specify one or more
              backup tags, only the specified tags are copied to  backups.  If
              you  specify  one  or  more  tags when creating a user-initiated
              backup, no tags are copied from the file system,  regardless  of
              this value.

              (Default = false )

              For more information, see Working with backups in the Amazon FSx
              for Lustre User Guide .

          DriveCacheType -> (string)
              The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file  systems  that
              are  provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter is re-
              quired when storage type is HDD. Set this property  to  READ  to
              improve the performance for frequently accessed files by caching
              up to 20% of the total storage capacity of the file system.

              This parameter is required when StorageType is set to HDD .

          DataCompressionType -> (string)
              Sets the data compression configuration  for  the  file  system.
              DataCompressionType can have the following values:

              o NONE  - (Default) Data compression is turned off when the file
                system is created.

              o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm.

              For more information, see Lustre data compression in the  Amazon
              FSx for Lustre User Guide .

          LogConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  Lustre  logging  configuration used when creating an Amazon
              FSx for Lustre file system. When logging is enabled, Lustre logs
              error  and  warning events for data repositories associated with
              your file system to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              Level -> (string)
                 Sets which data repository events are logged by Amazon FSx.

                 o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                 o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                 o WARN_ERROR - both  warning  events  and  error  events  are
                   logged.

                 o DISABLED - logging of data repository events is turned off.

              Destination -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the destination
                 of the logs.

                 The destination can be any Amazon CloudWatch Logs  log  group
                 ARN, with the following requirements:

                 o The  destination  ARN  that you provide must be in the same
                   Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon Web Services  Region,
                   and  Amazon  Web  Services  account as your Amazon FSx file
                   system.

                 o The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must begin
                   with the /aws/fsx prefix.

                 o If you do not provide a destination, Amazon FSx will create
                   and use a log stream in the CloudWatch Logs /aws/fsx/lustre
                   log group (for Amazon FSx for Lustre) or /aws/fsx/filecache
                   (for Amazon File Cache).

                 o If Destination is provided and the resource does not exist,
                   the request will fail with a BadRequest error.

                 o If Level is set to DISABLED , you cannot specify a destina-
                   tion in Destination .

          RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
              The Lustre root squash configuration used when creating an  Ama-
              zon  FSx  for  Lustre file system. When enabled, root squash re-
              stricts root-level access from clients that try to  access  your
              file system as a root user.

              RootSquash -> (string)
                 You  enable  root squash by setting a user ID (UID) and group
                 ID (GID) for the file system in the format UID:GID (for exam-
                 ple,  365534:65534 ). The UID and GID values can range from 0
                 to 4294967294 :

                 o A non-zero value for UID and GID enables root  squash.  The
                   UID  and  GID  values  can be different, but each must be a
                   non-zero value.

                 o A value of 0 (zero) for UID and  GID  indicates  root,  and
                   therefore disables root squash.

                 When  root  squash  is enabled, the user ID and group ID of a
                 root user accessing the file system are re-mapped to the  UID
                 and GID you provide.

              NoSquashNids -> (list)
                 When  root  squash  is enabled, you can optionally specify an
                 array of NIDs of clients for which root squash does  not  ap-
                 ply.  A  client  NID  is  a Lustre Network Identifier used to
                 uniquely identify a client. You can specify the NID as either
                 a single address or a range of addresses:

                 o A single address is described in standard Lustre NID format
                   by specifying the clients IP address followed by the Lustre
                   network ID (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                 o An  address range is described using a dash to separate the
                   range (for example, 10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

       --storage-type (string)
          Sets the storage type for the Windows or OpenZFS  file  system  that
          you're creating from a backup. Valid values are SSD and HDD .

          o Set  to  SSD to use solid state drive storage. SSD is supported on
            all Windows and OpenZFS deployment types.

          o Set to HDD to use hard disk drive storage.  HDD  is  supported  on
            SINGLE_AZ_2 and MULTI_AZ_1 FSx for Windows File Server file system
            deployment types.

          The default value is SSD .

          NOTE:
              HDD and SSD storage types have different minimum storage  capac-
              ity  requirements.  A restored file system's storage capacity is
              tied to the file system that was backed up.  You  can  create  a
              file system that uses HDD storage from a backup of a file system
              that used SSD storage if the original  SSD  file  system  had  a
              storage capacity of at least 2000 GiB.

          Possible values:

          o SSD

          o HDD

       --kms-key-id (string)
          Specifies  the ID of the Key Management Service (KMS) key to use for
          encrypting data on Amazon FSx file systems, as follows:

          o Amazon FSx for Lustre  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2  deployment
            types only.  SCRATCH_1 and SCRATCH_2 types are encrypted using the
            Amazon FSx service KMS key for your account.

          o Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

          o Amazon FSx for OpenZFS

          o Amazon FSx for Windows File Server

          If a KmsKeyId isn't specified, the Amazon FSx-managed  KMS  key  for
          your  account  is used. For more information, see Encrypt in the Key
          Management Service API Reference .

       --file-system-type-version (string)
          Sets the version for the Amazon FSx  for  Lustre  file  system  that
          you're creating from a backup. Valid values are 2.10 and 2.12 .

          You  don't  need to specify FileSystemTypeVersion because it will be
          applied using the backup's  FileSystemTypeVersion  setting.  If  you
          choose  to  specify FileSystemTypeVersion when creating from backup,
          the value must match the backup's FileSystemTypeVersion setting.

       --open-zfs-configuration (structure)
          The OpenZFS configuration for the file system that's being created.

          AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
              The number of days to retain  automatic  backups.  Setting  this
              property  to  0 disables automatic backups. You can retain auto-
              matic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 30 .

          CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value indicating whether  tags  for  the  file  system
              should  be  copied to backups. This value defaults to false . If
              it's set to true , all tags for the file system  are  copied  to
              all  automatic and user-initiated backups where the user doesn't
              specify tags. If this value is true , and  you  specify  one  or
              more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you
              specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated  backup,
              no  tags  are  copied  from  the file system, regardless of this
              value.

          CopyTagsToVolumes -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value indicating whether  tags  for  the  file  system
              should  be  copied to volumes. This value defaults to false . If
              it's set to true , all tags for the file system  are  copied  to
              volumes  where  the  user doesn't specify tags. If this value is
              true , and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags
              are copied to volumes. If you specify one or more tags when cre-
              ating the volume, no tags are copied from the file  system,  re-
              gardless of this value.

          DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
              A  recurring  daily  time,  in  the  format  HH:MM  .  HH is the
              zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM  is  the  zero-padded
              minute of the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

          DeploymentType -> (string)
              Specifies  the file system deployment type. Single AZ deployment
              types are configured for redundancy within a single Availability
              Zone  in  an  Amazon  Web Services Region . Valid values are the
              following:

              o SINGLE_AZ_1 - (Default) Creates file systems  with  throughput
                capacities of 64 - 4,096 MBps. Single_AZ_1 is available in all
                Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon FSx  for  OpenZFS  is
                available.

              o SINGLE_AZ_2  - Creates file systems with throughput capacities
                of 160 - 10,240 MB/s using an NVMe L2ARC cache. Single_AZ_2 is
                available  only  in the US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio),
                US West (Oregon), and Europe (Ireland) Amazon Web Services Re-
                gions.

              For more information, see: Deployment type availability and File
              system performance in the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

          ThroughputCapacity -> (integer)
              Specifies the throughput of an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file  sys-
              tem,  measured  in megabytes per second (MBps). Valid values de-
              pend on the DeploymentType you choose, as follows:

              o For SINGLE_AZ_1 , valid values are 64, 128,  256,  512,  1024,
                2048, 3072, or 4096 MBps.

              o For  SINGLE_AZ_2 , valid values are 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560,
                3840, 5120, 7680, or 10240 MBps.

              You pay for additional throughput capacity that you provision.

          WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
              A recurring weekly time, in the format D:HH:MM .
                 D is the day of the week, for which 1 represents Monday and 7
                 represents Sunday. For further details, see the ISO-8601 spec
                 as described on Wikipedia .

                 HH is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM  is  the
                 zero-padded minute of the hour.

              For example, 1:05:00 specifies maintenance at 5 AM Monday.

          DiskIopsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  SSD IOPS (input/output operations per second) configuration
              for an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP or FSx for OpenZFS file  sys-
              tem.  By default, Amazon FSx automatically provisions 3 IOPS per
              GB of storage capacity. You can provision additional IOPS per GB
              of  storage.  The  configuration consists of the total number of
              provisioned SSD IOPS and how it is was provisioned, or the  mode
              (by the customer or by Amazon FSx).

              Mode -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the file system is using the AUTOMATIC set-
                 ting of SSD IOPS of 3 IOPS per GB of storage capacity,  ,  or
                 if it using a USER_PROVISIONED value.

              Iops -> (long)
                 The total number of SSD IOPS provisioned for the file system.

          RootVolumeConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  configuration  Amazon FSx uses when creating the root value
              of the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system. All volumes are chil-
              dren of the root volume.

              RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  record  size  of  an  OpenZFS root volume, in
                 kibibytes (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,
                 512,  or  1024  KiB.  The  default is 128 KiB. Most workloads
                 should use the default record size.  Database  workflows  can
                 benefit from a smaller record size, while streaming workflows
                 can benefit from a larger record size. For  additional  guid-
                 ance on setting a custom record size, see Tips for maximizing
                 performance in the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

              DataCompressionType -> (string)
                 Specifies the method used to compress the data on the volume.
                 The compression type is NONE by default.

                 o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the volume. NONE is the
                   default.

                 o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the volume using  the  Zstan-
                   dard (ZSTD) compression algorithm. Compared to LZ4, Z-Stan-
                   dard  provides  a  better  compression  ratio  to  minimize
                   on-disk storage utilization.

                 o LZ4  - Compresses the data in the volume using the LZ4 com-
                   pression algorithm. Compared to  Z-Standard,  LZ4  is  less
                   compute-intensive  and  delivers  higher  write  throughput
                   speeds.

              NfsExports -> (list)
                 The configuration object for mounting a file system.

                 (structure)
                     The Network File System (NFS) configurations for mounting
                     an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.

                     ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                        A  list  of  configuration  objects  that  contain the
                        client and options for mounting the OpenZFS file  sys-
                        tem.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies who can mount an OpenZFS file system and
                            the options available while mounting the file sys-
                            tem.

                            Clients -> (string)
                               A  value  that specifies who can mount the file
                               system. You can provide a wildcard character (*
                               ),  an IP address (0.0.0.0 ), or a CIDR address
                               (192.0.2.0/24 ). By default,  Amazon  FSx  uses
                               the  wildcard  character  when  specifying  the
                               client.

                            Options -> (list)
                               The options to use when mounting the file  sys-
                               tem.  For  a  list  of options that you can use
                               with  Network  File  System  (NFS),   see   the
                               exports(5)  -  Linux  man  page . When choosing
                               your options, consider the following:

                               o crossmnt is used by  default.  If  you  don't
                                 specify  crossmnt  when  changing  the client
                                 configuration, you won't be able  to  see  or
                                 access  snapshots in your file system's snap-
                                 shot directory.

                               o sync is used by default. If you instead spec-
                                 ify  async  ,  the system acknowledges writes
                                 before writing to disk. If the system crashes
                                 before  the writes are finished, you lose the
                                 unwritten data.

                               (string)

              UserAndGroupQuotas -> (list)
                 An object specifying how much storage users or groups can use
                 on the volume.

                 (structure)
                     The  configuration  for  how much storage a user or group
                     can use on the volume.

                     Type -> (string)
                        A value that specifies whether the quota applies to  a
                        user or group.

                     Id -> (integer)
                        The ID of the user or group.

                     StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                        The  amount  of storage that the user or group can use
                        in gibibytes (GiB).

              CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the volume should
                 be  copied to snapshots of the volume. This value defaults to
                 false . If it's set to true , all tags  for  the  volume  are
                 copied  to  snapshots where the user doesn't specify tags. If
                 this value is true and you specify one or more tags, only the
                 specified tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify one or
                 more tags when creating the snapshot, no tags are copied from
                 the volume, regardless of this value.

              ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                 A  Boolean  value indicating whether the volume is read-only.
                 Setting this value to true can be useful after you have  com-
                 pleted  changes to a volume and no longer want changes to oc-
                 cur.

       --storage-capacity (integer)
          Sets the storage capacity of the OpenZFS  file  system  that  you're
          creating from a backup, in gibibytes (GiB). Valid values are from 64
          GiB up to 524,288 GiB (512 TiB). However, the value that you specify
          must  be  equal  to  or  greater  than the backup's storage capacity
          value. If you don't use the StorageCapacity parameter,  the  default
          is the backup's StorageCapacity value.

          If used to create a file system other than OpenZFS, you must provide
          a value that matches the backup's StorageCapacity value. If you pro-
          vide any other value, Amazon FSx responds with a 400 Bad Request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                reachable and available for use.

              o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the new file system.

              o DELETING - Amazon FSx is deleting an existing file system.

              o FAILED - An existing file system has experienced an unrecover-
                able failure. When creating a new file system, Amazon FSx  was
                unable to create the file system.

              the Amazon FSx file system was created in. For more information,
              see Elastic Network Interfaces in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

              For an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system,  you  can
              have one network interface ID. For an Amazon FSx for Lustre file
              system, you can have more than one.

              (string)
                 An elastic network interface ID. An elastic network interface
                 is  a logical networking component in a virtual private cloud
                 (VPC) that represents a virtual network card. For more infor-
                 mation, see Elastic Network Interfaces in the Amazon EC2 User

                 A  boolean  flag  indicating  whether tags on the file system
                 should be copied to backups. This value defaults to false. If
                 it's  set  to true, all tags on the file system are copied to
                 all automatic backups and any  user-initiated  backups  where
                 the user doesn't specify any tags. If this value is true, and
                 you specify one or more tags, only  the  specified  tags  are
                 copied  to backups. If you specify one or more tags when cre-
                 ating a user-initiated backup, no tags are  copied  from  the
                 file system, regardless of this value.

                 use  existing DNS names to access the data in your Amazon FSx
                 file system. You can associate up to 50 aliases with  a  file
                 system  at any time. You can associate additional DNS aliases
                 after you create the file system using the  AssociateFileSys-
                 temAliases  operation.  You  can  remove DNS aliases from the
                 file system after  it  is  created  using  the  Disassociate-
                 FileSystemAliases  operation.  You  only  need to specify the
                 alias name in the request payload. For more information,  see
                 DNS aliases .

                 (structure)
                     A  DNS alias that is associated with the file system. You
                     can use a  DNS  alias  to  access  a  file  system  using
                     user-defined  DNS  names,  in addition to the default DNS
                     name that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system. For more
                     information,  see DNS aliases in the FSx for Windows File

              DataRepositoryConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The data repository configuration object for Lustre file sys-
                 tems  returned in the response of the CreateFileSystem opera-
                 tion.

                 This data type is not supported on file systems with  a  data
                 repository  association. For file systems with a data reposi-
                 tory association, see .

                 Lifecycle -> (string)
                     Describes the state of the file system's S3 durable  data
                     repository,  if  it  is configured with an S3 repository.
                     The lifecycle can have the following values:

                     o CREATING - The data  repository  configuration  between
                       the  FSx  file system and the linked S3 data repository
                       is being created. The data repository is unavailable.

                     o AVAILABLE - The data repository is available for use.

                     o MISCONFIGURED - Amazon FSx cannot automatically  import
                       updates  from  the  S3 bucket until the data repository
                       configuration is corrected. For more  information,  see
                       Troubleshooting a Misconfigured linked S3 bucket .

                     o UPDATING - The data repository is undergoing a customer
                       initiated update and availability may be impacted.

                     o FAILED - The data repository is  in  a  terminal  state
                       that cannot be recovered.

                 ImportPath -> (string)
                     The  import  path  to  the Amazon S3 bucket (and optional
                     prefix) that you're using as the data repository for your
                     FSx   for   Lustre  file  system,  for  example  s3://im-
                     port-bucket/optional-prefix . If a  prefix  is  specified
                     after  the  Amazon  S3 bucket name, only object keys with
                     that prefix are loaded into the file system.

                 ExportPath -> (string)
                     The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that
                     you are using to store new and changed Lustre file system
                     files in S3.

                 ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                     For files imported from a data repository, this value de-
                     termines  the stripe count and maximum amount of data per
                     file (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maxi-
                     mum  number  of  disks  that a single file can be striped
                     across is limited by the total number of disks that  make
                     up the file system.

                     The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as
                     high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects  have  a
                     maximum size of 5 TB.

                 AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                     Describes  the  file system's linked S3 data repository's
                     AutoImportPolicy . The  AutoImportPolicy  configures  how
                     Amazon  FSx  keeps your file and directory listings up to
                     date as you add or  modify  objects  in  your  linked  S3
                     bucket. AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

                     o NONE - (Default) AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only up-
                       dates file and directory listings from  the  linked  S3
                       bucket  when  the  file system is created. FSx does not
                       update file and  directory  listings  for  any  new  or
                       changed objects after choosing this option.

                     o NEW  -  AutoImport  is on. Amazon FSx automatically im-
                       ports directory listings of any new  objects  added  to
                       the linked S3 bucket that do not currently exist in the
                       FSx file system.

                     o NEW_CHANGED - AutoImport is on.  Amazon  FSx  automati-
                       cally  imports  file  and directory listings of any new
                       objects added to the S3 bucket and any existing objects
                       that are changed in the S3 bucket after you choose this
                       option.

                     o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx  au-
                       tomatically  imports file and directory listings of any
                       new objects added to the S3 bucket,  any  existing  ob-
                       jects  that  are  changed in the S3 bucket, and any ob-
                       jects that were deleted in the S3 bucket.

                 FailureDetails -> (structure)
                     Provides detailed information about the  data  repository
                     if its Lifecycle is set to MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

                     Message -> (string)
                        A detailed error message.

              DeploymentType -> (string)
                 The  deployment  type  of  the  FSx  for  Lustre file system.
                 Scratch deployment type is designed for temporary storage and
                 shorter-term processing of data.
                     SCRATCH_1  and SCRATCH_2 deployment types are best suited
                     for when you need temporary storage and shorter-term pro-
                     cessing  of  data. The SCRATCH_2 deployment type provides
                     in-transit encryption of data and higher burst throughput
                     capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

                 The PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment type is used for
                 longer-term storage and workloads and encryption of  data  in
                 transit.  PERSISTENT_2  is  built  on Lustre v2.12 and offers
                 higher PerUnitStorageThroughput (up to 1000  MB/s/TiB)  along
                 with  a lower minimum storage capacity requirement (600 GiB).
                 To learn more about FSx for Lustre deployment types, see  FSx
                 for Lustre deployment options .

                 The default is SCRATCH_1 .

              PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                 Per unit storage throughput represents the megabytes per sec-
                 ond of read or write throughput per  1  tebibyte  of  storage
                 provisioned.  File  system  throughput  capacity  is equal to
                 Storage capacity (TiB) * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB).
                 This  option  is only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2
                 deployment types.

                 Valid values:

                 o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                 o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                 o For PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage: 125, 250, 500, 1000.

              MountName -> (string)
                 You use the MountName value when mounting the file system.

                 For the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value is always  "fsx
                 ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 , and PERSISTENT_2 deployment
                 types, this value is a string that is unique within an Amazon
                 Web Services Region.

              DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                 A  recurring  daily  time,  in  the  format HH:MM . HH is the
                 zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM is the zero-padded
                 minute of the hour. For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

              AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                 The  number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this
                 property to 0 disables automatic backups. You can retain  au-
                 tomatic backups for a maximum of 90 days. The default is 30 .

              CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                 A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system are
                 copied to backups. If it's set to true, all tags on the  file
                 system  are copied to all automatic backups and any user-ini-
                 tiated backups where the user doesn't specify  any  tags.  If
                 this  value  is  true, and you specify one or more tags, only
                 the specified tags are copied to backups. If you specify  one
                 or  more  tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags
                 are copied from the file system, regardless  of  this  value.
                 (Default = false)

              DriveCacheType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  drive  cache used by PERSISTENT_1 file systems
                 that are provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                 is  required  when  StorageType  is HDD. When set to READ the
                 file system has an SSD storage cache that is sized to 20%  of
                 the file system's storage capacity. This improves the perfor-
                 mance for frequently accessed files by caching up to  20%  of
                 the total storage capacity.

                 This parameter is required when StorageType is set to HDD.

              DataCompressionType -> (string)
                 The data compression configuration for the file system. Data-
                 CompressionType can have the following values:

                 o NONE - Data compression is turned off for the file system.

                 o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm.

                 For more information, see Lustre data compression .

              LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The Lustre logging configuration. Lustre logging  writes  the
                 enabled  log events for your file system to Amazon CloudWatch
                 Logs.

                 Level -> (string)
                     The data repository events that are logged by Amazon FSx.

                     o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                     o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                     o WARN_ERROR - both warning events and error  events  are
                       logged.

                     o DISABLED  - logging of data repository events is turned
                       off.

                     Note that Amazon File Cache uses  a  default  setting  of
                     WARN_ERROR , which can't be changed.

                 Destination -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the desti-
                     nation of the logs. The destination  can  be  any  Amazon
                     CloudWatch  Logs  log group ARN. The destination ARN must
                     be in the same Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon  Web
                     Services  Region, and Amazon Web Services account as your
                     Amazon FSx file system.

              RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The Lustre root squash configuration for an  Amazon  FSx  for
                 Lustre  file  system.  When  enabled,  root  squash restricts
                 root-level access from clients that try to access  your  file
                 system as a root user.

                 RootSquash -> (string)
                     You  enable  root  squash  by setting a user ID (UID) and
                     group ID (GID) for the file system in the format  UID:GID
                     (for  example, 365534:65534 ). The UID and GID values can
                     range from 0 to 4294967294 :

                     o A non-zero value for UID and GID enables  root  squash.
                       The  UID and GID values can be different, but each must
                       be a non-zero value.

                     o A value of 0 (zero) for UID and GID indicates root, and
                       therefore disables root squash.

                     When  root squash is enabled, the user ID and group ID of
                     a root user accessing the file system  are  re-mapped  to
                     the UID and GID you provide.

                 NoSquashNids -> (list)
                     When  root  squash is enabled, you can optionally specify
                     an array of NIDs of clients for which  root  squash  does
                     not  apply.  A  client NID is a Lustre Network Identifier
                     used to uniquely identify a client. You can  specify  the
                     NID as either a single address or a range of addresses:

                     o A  single  address  is described in standard Lustre NID
                       format by specifying the clients IP address followed by
                       the Lustre network ID (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                     o An  address range is described using a dash to separate
                       the range (for example, 10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                     (string)

          AdministrativeActions -> (list)
              A list of administrative actions for the file system that are in
              process  or  waiting to be processed. Administrative actions de-
              scribe changes to the Amazon FSx system that you have  initiated
              using the UpdateFileSystem operation.

              (structure)
                 Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative action for the
                 current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS file system.

                 AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                     Describes the type of administrative action, as follows:

                     o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system  update  administra-
                       tive  action initiated from the Amazon FSx console, API
                       (UpdateFileSystem ), or CLI (update-file-system ).

                     o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  -  After  the  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE
                       task  to  increase a file system's storage capacity has
                       been  completed  successfully,  a  STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION
                       task starts.

                       o For  Windows  and  ONTAP, storage optimization is the
                         process of migrating the file system  data  to  newer
                         larger disks.

                       o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists of rebal-
                         ancing the data across the existing and  newly  added
                         file servers.

                     You can track the storage-optimization progress using the
                     ProgressPercent property. When  STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  has
                     been  completed  successfully, the parent FILE_SYSTEM_UP-
                     DATE action status changes to COMPLETED . For more infor-
                     mation,  see  Managing storage capacity in the Amazon FSx
                     for Windows File Server User Guide , Managing storage and
                     throughput  capacity  in  the  Amazon FSx for Lustre User

                     IOPS in the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide .

                     o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_ASSOCIATION - A file system update to
                       associate a new Domain Name System (DNS) alias with the
                       file     system.     For    more    information,    see
                       AssociateFileSystemAliases .

                     o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_DISASSOCIATION - A file system update
                       to  disassociate  a DNS alias from the file system. For
                       more information, see DisassociateFileSystemAliases .

                     o VOLUME_UPDATE - A volume update to an  Amazon  FSx  for
                       NetApp ONTAP or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume initiated
                       from the Amazon FSx console, API  (UpdateVolume  ),  or
                       CLI (update-volume ).

                     o VOLUME_RESTORE  -  An  Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume is
                       returned to the state saved by the specified  snapshot,
                       initiated  from  an API (RestoreVolumeFromSnapshot ) or
                       CLI (restore-volume-from-snapshot ).

                     o SNAPSHOT_UPDATE - A snapshot update to  an  Amazon  FSx
                       for  OpenZFS  volume initiated from the Amazon FSx con-
                       sole, API (UpdateSnapshot ), or CLI (update-snapshot ).

                     o RELEASE_NFS_V3_LOCKS - Tracks the  release  of  Network
                       File System (NFS) V3 locks on an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS

                        server  subnet  identified  in  the  PreferredSubnetID
                        property.  All other file systems have only one subnet
                        ID.

                        For FSx for Lustre file systems, and Single-AZ Windows
                        file  systems,  this is the ID of the subnet that con-
                        tains the file system's endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1  Win-
                        dows  and ONTAP file systems, the file system endpoint
                        is available in the PreferredSubnetID .

                        ThroughputCapacity -> (integer)
                            The throughput of the Amazon FSx file system, mea-
                            sured in megabytes per second.

                        MaintenanceOperationsInProgress -> (list)
                            The list of maintenance operations in progress for
                            this file system.

                            (string)
                               An enumeration specifying the currently ongoing
                               maintenance operation.

                        WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                            The preferred start time to perform weekly mainte-
                            nance,  formatted  d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone. d
                            is the weekday number, from 1 through 7, beginning
                            with Monday and ending with Sunday.

                        DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                            The  preferred  time to take daily automatic back-
                            ups, in the UTC time zone.

                        AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                            The number of days to  retain  automatic  backups.
                            Setting  this to 0 disables automatic backups. You
                            can retain automatic backups for a maximum  of  90
                            days.

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file
                            system should be copied to backups. This value de-
                            faults  to false. If it's set to true, all tags on
                            the file system are copied to all automatic  back-
                            ups  and any user-initiated backups where the user
                            doesn't specify any tags. If this value  is  true,
                            and  you specify one or more tags, only the speci-
                            fied tags are copied to backups.  If  you  specify
                            one  or  more  tags when creating a user-initiated
                            backup, no tags are copied from the  file  system,
                            regardless of this value.

                        Aliases -> (list)
                            An  array of one or more DNS aliases that are cur-
                            rently associated with the Amazon FSx file system.
                            Aliases allow you to use existing DNS names to ac-
                            cess the data in your Amazon FSx file system.  You
                            can  associate up to 50 aliases with a file system
                            at any time.  You  can  associate  additional  DNS
                            aliases after you create the file system using the
                            AssociateFileSystemAliases operation. You can  re-
                            move  DNS aliases from the file system after it is
                            created  using  the  DisassociateFileSystemAliases
                            operation. You only need to specify the alias name
                            in the request payload. For more information,  see
                            DNS aliases .

                            (structure)
                               A  DNS  alias  that is associated with the file
                               system. You can use a DNS  alias  to  access  a
                               file  system  using  user-defined DNS names, in
                               addition to the default DNS  name  that  Amazon
                               FSx assigns to the file system. For more infor-
                               mation, see DNS aliases in the FSx for  Windows

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name  of the DNS alias. The alias name
                                   has to meet the following requirements:

                                   o Formatted  as  a  fully-qualified  domain
                                     name  (FQDN), hostname.domain , for exam-
                                     ple, accounting.example.com .

                                   o Can contain alphanumeric characters,  the
                                     underscore (_), and the hyphen (-).

                                   o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

                                   o Can start with a numeric.

                                   For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic
                                   characters as lowercase letters (a-z),  re-
                                   gardless of how you specify them: as upper-
                                   case letters,  lowercase  letters,  or  the
                                   corresponding letters in escape codes.

                               Lifecycle -> (string)
                                   Describes the state of the DNS alias.

                                   o AVAILABLE  -  The DNS alias is associated
                                     with an Amazon FSx file system.

                                   o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS
                                     alias  and  associating  it with the file
                                     system.

                                   o CREATE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable  to
                                     associate  the  DNS  alias  with the file
                                     system.

                                   o DELETING - Amazon FSx  is  disassociating
                                     the  DNS  alias  from the file system and
                                     deleting it.

                                   o DELETE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable  to
                                     disassociate  the DNS alias from the file
                                     system.

                        AuditLogConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The configuration that Amazon FSx for Windows File

                               with an S3 repository. The lifecycle  can  have
                               the following values:

                               o CREATING  - The data repository configuration
                                 between the FSx file system and the linked S3
                                 data  repository  is  being created. The data
                                 repository is unavailable.

                               o AVAILABLE - The data repository is  available
                                 for use.

                               o MISCONFIGURED  -  Amazon FSx cannot automati-
                                 cally import updates from the S3 bucket until

                                 bucket .

                               o UPDATING - The data repository is  undergoing
                                 a  customer initiated update and availability
                                 may be impacted.

                               o FAILED - The data repository is in a terminal
                                 state that cannot be recovered.

                               optional prefix) that you're using as the  data
                               repository for your FSx for Lustre file system,
                               for example  s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix
                               .  If a prefix is specified after the Amazon S3
                               bucket name, only object keys with that  prefix
                               are loaded into the file system.

                            ExportPath -> (string)
                               The  export  path  to the Amazon S3 bucket (and
                               prefix) that you are using  to  store  new  and
                               changed Lustre file system files in S3.

                            ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                               For files imported from a data repository, this
                               value determines the stripe count  and  maximum
                               amount  of  data  per file (in MiB) stored on a
                               single physical disk.  The  maximum  number  of
                               disks  that a single file can be striped across
                               is limited by the total number  of  disks  that
                               make up the file system.

                               The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and
                               can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon
                               S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                            AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                               Describes  the  file  system's  linked  S3 data
                               repository's AutoImportPolicy . The AutoImport-
                               Policy  configures  how  Amazon  FSx keeps your
                               file and directory listings up to date  as  you
                               add or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket.
                               AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

                               o NONE - (Default) AutoImport  is  off.  Amazon
                                 FSx  only updates file and directory listings
                                 from the linked S3 bucket when the file  sys-
                                 tem  is created. FSx does not update file and
                                 directory listings for any new or changed ob-
                                 jects after choosing this option.

                               o NEW  - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automati-
                                 cally imports directory listings of  any  new
                                 objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do
                                 not currently exist in the FSx file system.

                               o NEW_CHANGED - AutoImport is  on.  Amazon  FSx
                                 automatically   imports  file  and  directory
                                 listings of any new objects added to  the  S3
                                 bucket  and  any  existing  objects  that are
                                 changed in the S3  bucket  after  you  choose
                                 this option.

                               o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED  - AutoImport is on. Ama-
                                 zon FSx automatically imports file and direc-
                                 tory listings of any new objects added to the
                                 S3 bucket,  any  existing  objects  that  are
                                 changed  in  the  S3  bucket, and any objects
                                 that were deleted in the S3 bucket.

                            FailureDetails -> (structure)
                               Provides detailed information  about  the  data
                               repository  if  its Lifecycle is set to MISCON-
                               FIGURED or FAILED .

                               Message -> (string)
                                   A detailed error message.

                        DeploymentType -> (string)
                            The deployment type of the  FSx  for  Lustre  file
                            system.  Scratch  deployment  type is designed for
                            temporary storage and shorter-term  processing  of
                            data.
                               SCRATCH_1  and  SCRATCH_2  deployment types are
                               best suited for when you need temporary storage
                               and   shorter-term   processing  of  data.  The
                               SCRATCH_2 deployment type  provides  in-transit
                               encryption  of data and higher burst throughput
                               capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

                            The PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment  type
                            is  used for longer-term storage and workloads and
                            encryption of data  in  transit.  PERSISTENT_2  is
                            built  on  Lustre v2.12 and offers higher PerUnit-
                            StorageThroughput (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB) along with
                            a  lower minimum storage capacity requirement (600
                            GiB). To learn more about FSx for  Lustre  deploy-
                            ment  types, see FSx for Lustre deployment options
                            .

                            The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                        PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                            Per  unit  storage   throughput   represents   the
                            megabytes  per  second of read or write throughput
                            per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File system
                            throughput  capacity  is equal to Storage capacity
                            (TiB) * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB).  This
                            option  is only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSIS-
                            TENT_2 deployment types.

                            Valid values:

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                            o For PERSISTENT_2 SSD  storage:  125,  250,  500,
                              1000.

                        MountName -> (string)
                            You use the MountName value when mounting the file
                            system.

                            For the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this  value  is
                            always  "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 , and
                            PERSISTENT_2 deployment types,  this  value  is  a
                            string  that  is  unique within an Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices Region.

                        DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                            A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM  .  HH
                            is  the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM
                            is the zero-padded minute of the hour.  For  exam-
                            ple, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                        AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  days to retain automatic backups.
                            Setting this  property  to  0  disables  automatic
                            backups.  You  can  retain automatic backups for a
                            maximum of 90 days. The default is 30 .

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file
                            system are copied to backups. If it's set to true,
                            all tags on the file system are copied to all  au-
                            tomatic  backups  and  any  user-initiated backups
                            where the user doesn't specify any tags.  If  this
                            value  is  true, and you specify one or more tags,
                            only the specified tags are copied to backups.  If
                            you  specify  one  or  more  tags  when creating a
                            user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the
                            file  system, regardless of this value. (Default =
                            false)

                        DriveCacheType -> (string)
                            The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1  file
                            systems  that are provisioned with HDD storage de-
                            vices. This parameter is required when StorageType
                            is  HDD.  When  set to READ the file system has an
                            SSD storage cache that is sized to 20% of the file
                            system's  storage capacity. This improves the per-
                            formance for frequently accessed files by  caching
                            up to 20% of the total storage capacity.

                            This parameter is required when StorageType is set
                            to HDD.

                        DataCompressionType -> (string)
                            The data compression configuration  for  the  file
                            system. DataCompressionType can have the following
                            values:

                            o NONE - Data compression is turned  off  for  the
                              file system.

                            o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4
                              algorithm.

                            For more information, see Lustre data  compression
                            .

                        LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The  Lustre  logging configuration. Lustre logging
                            writes the enabled log events for your file system
                            to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                            Level -> (string)
                               The  data  repository events that are logged by
                               Amazon FSx.

                               o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                               o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                               o WARN_ERROR - both warning  events  and  error
                                 events are logged.

                               o DISABLED  - logging of data repository events
                                 is turned off.

                               Note that Amazon File Cache uses a default set-
                               ting of WARN_ERROR , which can't be changed.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that specifies
                               the destination of the  logs.  The  destination
                               can  be  any  Amazon  CloudWatch Logs log group
                               ARN. The destination ARN must be  in  the  same
                               Amazon  Web Services partition, Amazon Web Ser-
                               vices Region, and Amazon Web  Services  account
                               as your Amazon FSx file system.

                        RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The Lustre root squash configuration for an Amazon
                            FSx for Lustre file  system.  When  enabled,  root
                            squash  restricts  root-level  access from clients
                            that try to access your  file  system  as  a  root
                            user.

                            RootSquash -> (string)
                               You  enable  root  squash  by setting a user ID
                               (UID) and group ID (GID) for the file system in
                               the  format  UID:GID (for example, 365534:65534
                               ). The UID and GID values can range from  0  to
                               4294967294 :

                               o A non-zero value for UID and GID enables root
                                 squash. The UID and GID values can be differ-
                                 ent, but each must be a non-zero value.

                               o A value of 0 (zero) for UID and GID indicates
                                 root, and therefore disables root squash.

                               When root squash is enabled, the  user  ID  and
                               group ID of a root user accessing the file sys-
                               tem are re-mapped to the UID and GID  you  pro-
                               vide.

                            NoSquashNids -> (list)
                               When root squash is enabled, you can optionally
                               specify an array of NIDs of clients  for  which
                               root  squash  does not apply. A client NID is a
                               Lustre  Network  Identifier  used  to  uniquely
                               identify  a  client. You can specify the NID as
                               either a single  address  or  a  range  of  ad-
                               dresses:

                               o A  single  address  is  described in standard
                                 Lustre NID format by specifying  the  clients
                                 IP  address followed by the Lustre network ID
                                 (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                               o An address range is described using a dash to
                                 separate     the    range    (for    example,
                                 10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                               (string)

                     AdministrativeActions -> (list)
                        A list of administrative actions for the  file  system
                        that are in process or waiting to be processed. Admin-
                        istrative actions describe changes to the  Amazon  FSx
                        system  that  you  have  initiated  using  the Update-
                        FileSystem operation.

                        (structure)
                            Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative ac-
                            tion  for  the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS
                            file system.

                            AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                               Describes the type of administrative action, as

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system update ad-
                                 ministrative action initiated from the Amazon
                                 FSx  console, API (UpdateFileSystem ), or CLI
                                 (update-file-system ).

                               o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION -  After  the  FILE_SYS-
                                 TEM_UPDATE  task  to increase a file system's
                                 storage capacity has been completed  success-
                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using the ProgressPercent property. When  STOR-

                                      machine.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  flag indicating whether this
                                      volume is the root volume for its  stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume on an SVM can be  the  root  volume.
                                      This  value  defaults to false . If this
                                      value is true , then  this  is  the  SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an SVM, because you  must  first  delete
                                      all  non-root  volumes.  This flag, when
                                      set to false , helps you identify  which
                                      volumes  to delete before you can delete
                                      the SVM.

                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold"  and  moved  to  the capacity
                                          pool. Used with the AUTO  and  SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY  tiering policies. Enter a
                                          whole number between 2 and 183.  De-
                                          fault  values  are  31 days for AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          Specifies the tiering policy used to
                                          transition  data.  Default  value is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves  cold  snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage
                                            tier.

                                          o AUTO - moves cold  user  data  and

                                            storage tier based on your  access
                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL  -  moves all user data blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage
                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE - keeps a  volume's  data  in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing it from being moved to the ca-

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The  volume's universally unique identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW  specifies  a read/write volume. RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster  occurs,  you  can  use these
                                        data-protection mirror copies  to  re-
                                        cover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume. A load-sharing mirror  reduces
                                        the  network traffic to a FlexVol vol-
                                        ume by providing additional  read-only
                                        access to clients.

                                   SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  snapshot  policy for the
                                      volume. There are three  built-in  snap-
                                      shot policies:

                                      o default  : This is the default policy.
                                        A  maximum  of  six  hourly  snapshots
                                        taken  five  minutes  past the hour. A
                                        maximum of two daily  snapshots  taken
                                        Monday  through Saturday at 10 minutes
                                        after  midnight.  A  maximum  of   two
                                        weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at
                                        15 minutes after midnight.

                                      o default-1weekly : This policy  is  the
                                        same as the default policy except that
                                        it only retains one snapshot from  the
                                        weekly schedule.

                                      o none  :  This policy does not take any
                                        snapshots. This policy can be assigned
                                        to  volumes to prevent automatic snap-
                                        shots from being taken.

                                      You can also provide the name of a  cus-
                                      tom policy that you created with the ON-
                                      TAP CLI or REST API.

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to back-
                                      ups. This value defaults  to  false.  If
                                      it's  set to true, all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are  copied  to  all  automatic  and
                                      user-initiated  backups  where  the user
                                      doesn't specify tags. If this  value  is
                                      true,  and you specify one or more tags,
                                      only the specified tags  are  copied  to
                                      backups. If you specify one or more tags
                                      when creating a  user-initiated  backup,
                                      no  tags are copied from the volume, re-
                                      gardless of this value.

                               ResourceARN -> (string)

                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services resources. We require an ARN  when
                                   you  need  to  specify a resource unambigu-
                                   ously across all of  Amazon  Web  Services.

                               Tags -> (list)
                                   A  list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50
                                   elements.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a key-value  pair  for  a  re-
                                      source tag.

                                          A  value that specifies the TagKey ,
                                          the name of the tag. Tag  keys  must
                                          be  unique for the resource to which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the  TagValue
                                          ,  the  value assigned to the corre-
                                          sponding tag key. Tag values can  be
                                          null  and don't have to be unique in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a key-value pair in a tag set of fi-

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to  reserve  from the parent volume. You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)

                                      its  parent.  You  can  specify  a quota
                                      larger than the storage  on  the  parent
                                      volume.

                                   RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                      The record size of an OpenZFS volume, in
                                      kibibytes (KiB). Valid values are 4,  8,
                                      16,  32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB.
                                      The default is 128 KiB.  Most  workloads
                                      should  use the default record size. For
                                      guidance on when to set a custom  record
                                      size,  see  the  Amazon  FSx for OpenZFS

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the method  used  to  compress
                                      the  data on the volume. The compression
                                      type is NONE by default.

                                      o NONE - Doesn't compress  the  data  on
                                        the volume. NONE is the default.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume using the  Zstandard  (ZSTD)  com-
                                        pression  algorithm.  Compared to LZ4,
                                        Z-Standard provides a better  compres-
                                        sion ratio to minimize on-disk storage
                                        utilization.

                                      o LZ4 - Compresses the data in the  vol-
                                        ume  using  the  LZ4 compression algo-
                                        rithm. Compared to Z-Standard, LZ4  is
                                        less  compute-intensive  and  delivers
                                        higher write throughput speeds.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean value indicating whether  tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are copied to  snapshots  where  the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is true and  you  specify  one  or  more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are copied from the  volume,  regardless
                                      of this value.

                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)

                                          given resource. ARNs uniquely  iden-
                                          tify  Amazon Web Services resources.
                                          We require an ARN when you  need  to
                                          specify   a  resource  unambiguously
                                          across all of Amazon  Web  Services.

                                          o CLONE - The new volume  references
                                            the  data  in the origin snapshot.
                                            Cloning a snapshot is faster  than
                                            copying  the  data from a snapshot
                                            to a new volume and  doesn't  con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin snapshot can't  be  deleted
                                            if  there  is  a  volume using its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY - Copies all  data  from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  value indicating whether the
                                      volume is read-only.

                            you  from  the  198.19.*  range. By default in the
                            Amazon FSx console, Amazon FSx chooses the last 64
                            IP  addresses  from the VPCs primary CIDR range to
                            use as the endpoint IP address range for the  file
                            system.  You  can have overlapping endpoint IP ad-

                            user  doesn't  specify tags. If this value is true
                            and you specify one or more tags, only the  speci-
                            fied  tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify
                            one or more tags when creating  the  snapshot,  no
                            tags  are  copied  from  the volume, regardless of

                     FileSystemId -> (string)
                        The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by
                        Amazon FSx.

                     Lifecycle -> (string)
                        The lifecycle status of the volume.

                        o AVAILABLE - The volume is fully available for use.

                        o CREATED - The volume has been created.

                        o FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable to create the volume.

                        o MISCONFIGURED - The volume is in a failed but recov-
                          erable state.

                        o PENDING  -  Amazon  FSx  hasn't started creating the
                          volume.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the volume.

                     OntapConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The configuration of an Amazon FSx  for  NetApp  ONTAP
                        volume.

                        FlexCacheEndpointType -> (string)
                            Specifies  the FlexCache endpoint type of the vol-
                            ume. Valid values are the following:

                            o NONE specifies that the volume  doesn't  have  a
                              FlexCache configuration. NONE is the default.

                            o ORIGIN  specifies  that the volume is the origin
                              volume for a FlexCache volume.

                            o CACHE specifies that the volume is  a  FlexCache
                              volume.

                        JunctionPath -> (string)
                            Specifies   the  directory  that  network-attached
                            storage (NAS) clients use  to  mount  the  volume,
                            along  with  the storage virtual machine (SVM) Do-
                            main Name System (DNS) name or IP address. You can
                            create a JunctionPath directly below a parent vol-
                            ume junction or on a directory within a volume.  A
                            JunctionPath  for  a  volume  named  vol3 might be
                            /vol1/vol2/vol3 , or  /vol1/dir2/vol3  ,  or  even
                            /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                        SecurityStyle -> (string)
                            The  security  style  for the volume, which can be
                            UNIX , NTFS , or MIXED .

                        SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                            The configured size of the  volume,  in  megabytes
                            (MBs).

                        StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                            The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                        StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                            The ID of the volume's storage virtual machine.

                        StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  flag indicating whether this volume is
                            the root volume for its  storage  virtual  machine
                            (SVM).  Only  one volume on an SVM can be the root
                            volume. This value defaults to  false  .  If  this
                            value is true , then this is the SVM root volume.

                            This  flag  is useful when you're deleting an SVM,
                            because you must first delete  all  non-root  vol-
                            umes.  This  flag,  when  set to false , helps you
                            identify which volumes to delete  before  you  can
                            delete the SVM.

                        TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                            The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                            CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                               Specifies  the number of days that user data in
                               a volume must remain inactive before it is con-
                               sidered  "cold" and moved to the capacity pool.
                               Used with the AUTO  and  SNAPSHOT_ONLY  tiering
                               policies.  Enter  a  whole number between 2 and
                               183. Default values are 31 days for AUTO and  2
                               days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                            Name -> (string)
                               Specifies the tiering policy used to transition
                               data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                               o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold snapshots  to  the
                                 capacity pool storage tier.

                               o AUTO  - moves cold user data and snapshots to
                                 the capacity pool storage tier based on  your
                                 access patterns.

                               o ALL  - moves all user data blocks in both the
                                 active file system and Snapshot copies to the
                                 storage pool tier.

                               o NONE  -  keeps a volume's data in the primary
                                 storage tier, preventing it from being  moved
                                 to the capacity pool tier.

                        UUID -> (string)
                            The volume's universally unique identifier (UUID).

                        OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                            Specifies the type of volume. Valid values are the
                            following:

                            o RW specifies a read/write volume. RW is the  de-
                              fault.

                            o DP  specifies  a data-protection volume. You can
                              protect data by replicating it  to  data-protec-
                              tion  mirror  copies.  If a disaster occurs, you
                              can use these data-protection mirror  copies  to
                              recover data.

                            o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror volume. A
                              load-sharing mirror reduces the network  traffic
                              to  a  FlexVol  volume  by  providing additional
                              read-only access to clients.

                        SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                            Specifies the  snapshot  policy  for  the  volume.
                            There are three built-in snapshot policies:

                            o default  : This is the default policy. A maximum
                              of six hourly snapshots taken five minutes  past
                              the hour. A maximum of two daily snapshots taken
                              Monday through Saturday at 10 minutes after mid-
                              night.  A  maximum of two weekly snapshots taken
                              every Sunday at 15 minutes after midnight.

                            o default-1weekly : This policy is the same as the
                              default  policy  except that it only retains one
                              snapshot from the weekly schedule.

                            o none : This policy does not take any  snapshots.
                              This  policy  can be assigned to volumes to pre-
                              vent automatic snapshots from being taken.

                            You can also provide the name of a  custom  policy
                            that you created with the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                            For more information, see Snapshot policies in the
                            Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide .

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags  for  the
                            volume should be copied to backups. This value de-
                            faults to false. If it's set to true, all tags for
                            the   volume  are  copied  to  all  automatic  and
                            user-initiated  backups  where  the  user  doesn't
                            specify tags. If this value is true, and you spec-
                            ify one or more tags, only the specified tags  are
                            copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags
                            when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are
                            copied from the volume, regardless of this value.

                     ResourceARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for a given resource.
                        ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                        We  require an ARN when you need to specify a resource
                        unambiguously across all of Amazon Web  Services.  For
                        more  information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
                        the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                               the  tag.  Tag  keys must be unique for the re-
                               source to which they are attached.

                            Value -> (string)
                               A value that specifies the TagValue , the value
                               assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag val-
                               ues can be null and don't have to be unique  in
                               a   tag  set.  For  example,  you  can  have  a
                               key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April
                               and also of payroll : April .

                     LifecycleTransitionReason -> (structure)
                        The reason why the volume lifecycle status changed.

                        Message -> (string)
                            A detailed error message.

                     AdministrativeActions -> (list)
                        A  list  of administrative actions for the volume that
                        are in process or waiting to be processed. Administra-
                        tive  actions  describe changes to the volume that you
                        have initiated using the UpdateVolume action.

                        (structure)
                            Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative ac-
                            tion  for  the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS
                            file system.

                            AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                               Describes the type of administrative action, as
                               follows:

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system update ad-
                                 ministrative action initiated from the Amazon
                                 FSx  console, API (UpdateFileSystem ), or CLI
                                 (update-file-system ).

                               o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION -  After  the  FILE_SYS-
                                 TEM_UPDATE  task  to increase a file system's
                                 storage capacity has been completed  success-
                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using the ProgressPercent property. When  STOR-
                               AGE_OPTIMIZATION  has  been  completed success-
                               fully,  the  parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action
                               status changes to COMPLETED . For more informa-

                                   file system deployment type, there are  two
                                   subnet  IDs,  one  for  the  preferred file
                                   server and one for the standby file server.
                                   The preferred file server subnet identified
                                   in  the  PreferredSubnetID  property.   All
                                   other file systems have only one subnet ID.

                                   of  the  subnet that contains the file sys-
                                   tem's endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1 Windows  and
                                   ONTAP  file  systems,  the file system end-
                                   point is available in the PreferredSubnetID
                                   .

                                   (string)

                                      FSx  file  system.  Aliases allow you to
                                      use existing DNS  names  to  access  the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can associate up to 50  aliases  with  a
                                      file  system  at any time. You can asso-
                                      ciate additional DNS aliases  after  you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You  can
                                      remove  DNS aliases from the file system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You only
                                      need to specify the alias  name  in  the

                                          prefix are loaded into the file sys-
                                          tem.

                                      ExportPath -> (string)
                                          The  export  path  to  the Amazon S3
                                          bucket (and prefix) that you are us-
                                          ing  to store new and changed Lustre

                                      ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                                          For  files  imported  from  a   data
                                          repository,  this  value  determines
                                          the stripe count and maximum  amount
                                          of  data per file (in MiB) stored on
                                          a single physical disk. The  maximum
                                          number  of  disks that a single file
                                          can be striped across is limited  by
                                          the  total number of disks that make
                                          up the file system.

                                          The default chunk size is 1,024  MiB
                                          (1  GiB)  and  can  go  as  high  as
                                          512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 ob-

                                   DeploymentType -> (string)
                                      The  deployment type of the FSx for Lus-
                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is  designed  for  temporary storage and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1 and  SCRATCH_2  deployment
                                          types  are  best suited for when you
                                          need    temporary    storage     and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2 deployment  type  provides
                                          in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                          higher  burst  throughput   capacity
                                          than SCRATCH_1 .

                                      The  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2 de-
                                      ployment type is  used  for  longer-term
                                      storage  and workloads and encryption of
                                      data in transit. PERSISTENT_2  is  built
                                      on  Lustre  v2.12  and offers higher Pe-
                                      rUnitStorageThroughput   (up   to   1000
                                      MB/s/TiB)  along  with  a  lower minimum
                                      storage capacity requirement (600  GiB).

                                   PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                                      Per  unit  storage throughput represents
                                      the megabytes  per  second  of  read  or
                                      write throughput per 1 tebibyte of stor-
                                      age provisioned. File system  throughput
                                      capacity  is  equal  to Storage capacity
                                      (TiB)     *     PerUnitStorageThroughput
                                      (MB/s/TiB).  This  option  is only valid
                                      for PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2  de-
                                      ployment types.

                                      Valid values:

                                      o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100,
                                        200.

                                      o For  PERSISTENT_2  SSD  storage:  125,
                                        250, 500, 1000.

                                   MountName -> (string)
                                      You  use the MountName value when mount-
                                      ing the file system.

                                      For the SCRATCH_1 deployment type,  this
                                      value  is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 ,
                                      PERSISTENT_1 , and PERSISTENT_2  deploy-
                                      ment  types, this value is a string that
                                      is unique within an Amazon Web  Services
                                      Region.

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A  recurring  daily  time, in the format
                                      HH:MM . HH is the  zero-padded  hour  of
                                      the   day   (0-23),   and   MM   is  the
                                      zero-padded minute of the hour. For  ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of days to retain automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables  automatic backups. You can retain
                                      automatic backups for a  maximum  of  90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags
                                      on the file system are copied  to  back-
                                      ups.  If  it's  set to true, all tags on
                                      the file system are copied to all  auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups where the user  doesn't  specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated   backup,   no  tags  are
                                      copied from the file system,  regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The  type of drive cache used by PERSIS-
                                      TENT_1 file systems that are provisioned
                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is required  when  StorageType  is  HDD.
                                      When  set to READ the file system has an
                                      SSD storage cache that is sized  to  20%
                                      of  the  file system's storage capacity.
                                      This improves the performance  for  fre-
                                      quently  accessed files by caching up to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      Destination -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that
                                          specifies  the  destination  of  the
                                          logs. The  destination  can  be  any

                                   RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The Lustre root squash configuration for
                                      an  Amazon  FSx  for Lustre file system.
                                      When  enabled,  root  squash   restricts
                                      root-level  access from clients that try
                                      to access your file  system  as  a  root
                                      user.

                                      RootSquash -> (string)
                                          You  enable root squash by setting a
                                          user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for
                                          the   file   system  in  the  format
                                          UID:GID (for  example,  365534:65534
                                          ).  The UID and GID values can range
                                          from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                          o A non-zero value for UID  and  GID
                                            enables  root  squash. The UID and
                                            GID values can be  different,  but
                                            each must be a non-zero value.

                                          o A  value  of  0 (zero) for UID and
                                            GID indicates root, and  therefore
                                            disables root squash.

                                          When  root  squash  is  enabled, the
                                          user ID and group ID of a root  user
                                          accessing   the   file   system  are
                                          re-mapped to the  UID  and  GID  you
                                          provide.

                                      NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                          When root squash is enabled, you can
                                          optionally specify an array of  NIDs
                                          of  clients  for  which  root squash
                                          does not apply. A client  NID  is  a
                                          Lustre  Network  Identifier  used to
                                          uniquely identify a client. You  can
                                          specify  the  NID as either a single
                                          address or a range of addresses:

                                          o A single address is  described  in
                                            standard   Lustre  NID  format  by
                                            specifying the clients IP  address
                                            followed  by the Lustre network ID
                                            (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                                          o An address range is described  us-
                                            ing  a  dash to separate the range
                                            (for                      example,
                                            10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables automatic backups. You can  retain
                                      automatic  backups  for  a maximum of 90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)

                                      Specifies the FlexCache endpoint type of
                                      the volume. Valid values are the follow-
                                      ing:

                                      o NONE specifies that the volume doesn't
                                        have  a  FlexCache configuration. NONE
                                        is the default.

                                      o ORIGIN specifies that  the  volume  is
                                        the origin volume for a FlexCache vol-
                                        ume.

                                      o CACHE specifies that the volume  is  a
                                        FlexCache volume.

                                   JunctionPath -> (string)
                                      Specifies the directory that network-at-
                                      tached  storage  (NAS)  clients  use  to
                                      mount the volume, along with the storage
                                      virtual machine (SVM) Domain Name System
                                      (DNS) name or IP address. You can create
                                      a JunctionPath directly below  a  parent
                                      volume junction or on a directory within
                                      a volume. A JunctionPath  for  a  volume
                                      named vol3 might be /vol1/vol2/vol3 , or
                                      /vol1/dir2/vol3      ,      or      even
                                      /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                                   SecurityStyle -> (string)
                                      The security style for the volume, which
                                      can be UNIX , NTFS , or MIXED .

                                   SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                                      The configured size of  the  volume,  in
                                      megabytes (MBs).

                                   StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                                      The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                      The  ID  of the volume's storage virtual
                                      machine.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean flag indicating  whether  this
                                      volume  is the root volume for its stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume  on  an  SVM can be the root volume.
                                      This value defaults to false .  If  this
                                      value  is  true  ,  then this is the SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an  SVM,  because  you must first delete
                                      all non-root volumes.  This  flag,  when
                                      set  to false , helps you identify which
                                      volumes to delete before you can  delete
                                      the SVM.

                                   TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                                      The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                                      CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                                          Specifies  the  number  of days that
                                          user data in a  volume  must  remain
                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold" and  moved  to  the  capacity
                                          pool.  Used  with the AUTO and SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY tiering policies. Enter  a
                                          whole  number between 2 and 183. De-
                                          fault values are 31  days  for  AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          Specifies the tiering policy used to
                                          transition data.  Default  value  is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage
                                            tier.

                                          o AUTO  -  moves  cold user data and
                                            snapshots  to  the  capacity  pool
                                            storage  tier based on your access
                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL - moves all user  data  blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage
                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing it from being moved to the ca-
                                            pacity pool tier.

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The volume's universally unique  identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW specifies a read/write  volume.  RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster occurs,  you  can  use  these
                                        data-protection  mirror  copies to re-
                                        cover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume.  A load-sharing mirror reduces
                                        the network traffic to a FlexVol  vol-
                                        ume  by providing additional read-only
                                        access to clients.

                                   SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                      Specifies the snapshot  policy  for  the
                                      volume.  There  are three built-in snap-
                                      shot policies:

                                      o default : This is the default  policy.
                                        A  maximum  of  six  hourly  snapshots
                                        taken five minutes past  the  hour.  A
                                        maximum  of  two daily snapshots taken
                                        Monday through Saturday at 10  minutes
                                        after   midnight.  A  maximum  of  two
                                        weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at
                                        15 minutes after midnight.

                                      o default-1weekly  :  This policy is the
                                        same as the default policy except that
                                        it  only retains one snapshot from the
                                        weekly schedule.

                                      o none : This policy does not  take  any
                                        snapshots. This policy can be assigned
                                        to volumes to prevent automatic  snap-
                                        shots from being taken.

                                      You  can also provide the name of a cus-
                                      tom policy that you created with the ON-
                                      TAP CLI or REST API.

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to back-
                                      ups.  This  value  defaults to false. If
                                      it's set to true, all tags for the  vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to  all  automatic and
                                      user-initiated backups  where  the  user
                                      doesn't  specify  tags. If this value is
                                      true, and you specify one or more  tags,
                                      only  the  specified  tags are copied to
                                      backups. If you specify one or more tags
                                      when  creating  a user-initiated backup,
                                      no tags are copied from the volume,  re-
                                      gardless of this value.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the TagKey  ,
                                          the  name  of the tag. Tag keys must
                                          be unique for the resource to  which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to reserve from the parent  volume.  You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The maximum amount of storage in  gibib-
                                      tyes  (GiB) that the volume can use from
                                      its parent.  You  can  specify  a  quota
                                      larger  than  the  storage on the parent
                                      volume.

                                   RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                      The record size of an OpenZFS volume, in
                                      kibibytes  (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8,
                                      16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024  KiB.
                                      The  default  is 128 KiB. Most workloads
                                      should use the default record size.  For
                                      guidance  on when to set a custom record
                                      size, see the  Amazon  FSx  for  OpenZFS

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  method  used to compress
                                      the data on the volume. The  compression
                                      type is NONE by default.

                                      o NONE  -  Doesn't  compress the data on
                                        the volume. NONE is the default.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume  using  the  Zstandard (ZSTD) com-
                                        pression algorithm. Compared  to  LZ4,
                                        Z-Standard  provides a better compres-
                                        sion ratio to minimize on-disk storage
                                        utilization.

                                      o LZ4  - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume using the  LZ4  compression  algo-
                                        rithm.  Compared to Z-Standard, LZ4 is
                                        less  compute-intensive  and  delivers
                                        higher write throughput speeds.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean value indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The configuration object that  specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given  resource. ARNs uniquely iden-
                                          tify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                                          We  require  an ARN when you need to
                                          specify  a  resource   unambiguously
                                          across  all  of Amazon Web Services.
                                          For more information, see Amazon Re-
                                          source  Names  (ARNs)  in the Amazon
                                          Web Services General Reference .

                                      CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                          The strategy used when copying  data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE  - The new volume references
                                            the data in the  origin  snapshot.
                                            Cloning  a snapshot is faster than
                                            copying the data from  a  snapshot
                                            to  a  new volume and doesn't con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin  snapshot  can't be deleted
                                            if there is  a  volume  using  its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY  -  Copies all data from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean value indicating  whether  the
                                      volume is read-only.

                                   NfsExports -> (list)
                                      The  configuration object for mounting a
                                      Network File System (NFS) file system.

                                      (structure)

                                             tions for  mounting  the  OpenZFS
                                             file system.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Specifies  who  can  mount an

                                                 options    available    while
                                                 mounting the file system.

                                                 Clients -> (string)

                                                    ). By default, Amazon  FSx
                                                    uses  the wildcard charac-

                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagValue
                                          , the value assigned to  the  corre-
                                          sponding  tag key. Tag values can be
                                          null and don't have to be unique  in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have

                            The  amount  of  storage in gibibytes (GiB) to re-
                            serve from the parent volume.  You  can't  reserve
                            more storage than the parent volume has reserved.

                            (KiB).  Valid  values  are  4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128,
                            256, 512, or 1024 KiB. The  default  is  128  KiB.
                            Most workloads should use the default record size.
                            For guidance on when to set a custom record  size,
                            see the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

                        DataCompressionType -> (string)
                            Specifies  the method used to compress the data on
                            the volume. The compression type is  NONE  by  de-
                            fault.

                            o NONE  - Doesn't compress the data on the volume.
                              NONE is the default.

                            o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the  volume  using
                              the Zstandard (ZSTD) compression algorithm. Com-
                              pared to LZ4, Z-Standard provides a better  com-
                              pression  ratio to minimize on-disk storage uti-
                              lization.

                            o LZ4 - Compresses the data in  the  volume  using
                              the   LZ4  compression  algorithm.  Compared  to
                              Z-Standard, LZ4 is  less  compute-intensive  and
                              delivers higher write throughput speeds.

                        CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  value  indicating whether tags for the
                            volume should be copied to snapshots.  This  value
                            defaults to false . If it's set to true , all tags
                            for the volume are copied to snapshots  where  the
                            user  doesn't  specify tags. If this value is true
                            and you specify one or more tags, only the  speci-
                            fied  tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify
                            one or more tags when creating  the  snapshot,  no
                            tags  are  copied  from  the volume, regardless of
                            this value.

                        OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                            The configuration object that specifies the  snap-
                            shot to use as the origin of the data for the vol-
                            ume.

                            SnapshotARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given  re-
                               source.  ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Ser-
                               vices resources. We require  an  ARN  when  you
                               need to specify a resource unambiguously across
                               all of Amazon Web Services. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the
                               Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                            CopyStrategy -> (string)
                               The strategy used when copying  data  from  the
                               snapshot to the new volume.

                               o CLONE - The new volume references the data in
                                 the origin snapshot. Cloning  a  snapshot  is
                                 faster  than copying the data from a snapshot
                                 to a new  volume  and  doesn't  consume  disk
                                 throughput.   However,  the  origin  snapshot
                                 can't be deleted if there is a  volume  using
                                 its copied data.

                               o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the snapshot
                                 to the new volume.

                        ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value indicating whether the  volume  is
                            read-only.

                                   the OpenZFS file system.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies who can mount an OpenZFS  file
                                      system  and  the options available while
                                      mounting the file system.

                                      Clients -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies who can mount
                                          the  file  system. You can provide a

                                          dress  (0.0.0.0 ), or a CIDR address
                                          (192.0.2.0/24 ). By default,  Amazon
                                          FSx uses the wildcard character when
                                          specifying the client.

                                      Options -> (list)
                                          The options to use when mounting the
                                          file  system.  For a list of options
                                          that you can use with  Network  File
                                          System  (NFS),  see the exports(5) -
                                          Linux man page . When choosing  your
                                          options, consider the following:

                                          o crossmnt  is  used  by default. If
                                            you don't  specify  crossmnt  when
                                            changing the client configuration,
                                            you won't be able to see or access
                                            snapshots  in  your  file system's
                                            snapshot directory.

                                          o sync is used by  default.  If  you
                                            instead specify async , the system
                                            acknowledges writes before writing
                                            to disk. If the system crashes be-
                                            fore the writes are finished,  you
                                            lose the unwritten data.

                                 TEM_UPDATE task to increase a  file  system's
                                 storage  capacity has been completed success-
                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For Lustre, storage  optimization  consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using  the ProgressPercent property. When STOR-
                               AGE_OPTIMIZATION has  been  completed  success-
                               fully,  the  parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action
                               status changes to COMPLETED . For more informa-

                                   file  system deployment type, there are two
                                   subnet IDs,  one  for  the  preferred  file
                                   server and one for the standby file server.
                                   The preferred file server subnet identified
                                   in   the  PreferredSubnetID  property.  All
                                   other file systems have only one subnet ID.

                                   For FSx for Lustre file systems,  and  Sin-
                                   gle-AZ Windows file systems, this is the ID
                                   of the subnet that contains the  file  sys-
                                   tem's  endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1 Windows and
                                   ONTAP file systems, the  file  system  end-
                                   point is available in the PreferredSubnetID
                                   .

                                   (string)
                                      The ID for a subnet. A subnet is a range

                                   sible. The elastic network interface is au-
                                   tomatically  created  in  the  same virtual
                                   private cloud (VPC)  that  the  Amazon  FSx
                                   file system was created in. For more infor-

                                      For  MULTI_AZ_1  deployment  types,  use
                                      this  endpoint  when performing adminis-
                                      trative tasks on the file  system  using
                                      Amazon FSx Remote PowerShell.

                                      For  SINGLE_AZ_1 and SINGLE_AZ_2 deploy-
                                      ment types, this is the DNS name of  the
                                      file system.

                                      This endpoint is temporarily unavailable
                                      when the file system is undergoing main-
                                      tenance.

                                   PreferredSubnetId -> (string)
                                      For   MULTI_AZ_1  deployment  types,  it
                                      specifies the ID of the subnet where the
                                      preferred  file  server is located. Must
                                      be one of the two subnet  IDs  specified
                                      in SubnetIds property. Amazon FSx serves
                                      traffic from this subnet except  in  the
                                      event  of  a  failover  to the secondary

                                      backups.  This  value defaults to false.
                                      If it's set to true,  all  tags  on  the
                                      file  system are copied to all automatic
                                      backups and any  user-initiated  backups
                                      where the user doesn't specify any tags.
                                      If this value is true, and  you  specify
                                      one  or  more  tags,  only the specified
                                      tags are copied to backups. If you spec-
                                      ify  one  or  more  tags when creating a

                                      of this value.

                                   Aliases -> (list)
                                      An array of one or more DNS aliases that
                                      are currently associated with the Amazon
                                      FSx file system. Aliases  allow  you  to
                                      use  existing  DNS  names  to access the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can  associate  up  to 50 aliases with a
                                      file system at any time. You  can  asso-
                                      ciate  additional  DNS aliases after you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases  operation. You can
                                      remove DNS aliases from the file  system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You only
                                      need  to  specify  the alias name in the
                                      request payload. For  more  information,
                                      see DNS aliases .

                                          the file system. You can use  a  DNS
                                          alias  to access a file system using
                                          user-defined DNS names, in  addition
                                          to  the default DNS name that Amazon
                                          FSx assigns to the file system.  For

                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is designed for  temporary  storage  and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1  and  SCRATCH_2 deployment
                                          types are best suited for  when  you
                                          need     temporary    storage    and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2  deployment  type provides
                                          in-transit encryption  of  data  and
                                          higher   burst  throughput  capacity

                                   MountName -> (string)
                                      You use the MountName value when  mount-
                                      ing the file system.

                                      For  the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this
                                      value is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2  ,
                                      PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 deploy-
                                      ment types, this value is a string  that
                                      is  unique within an Amazon Web Services
                                      Region.

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A recurring daily time,  in  the  format
                                      HH:MM  .  HH  is the zero-padded hour of
                                      the  day   (0-23),   and   MM   is   the
                                      zero-padded  minute of the hour. For ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The number of days to  retain  automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables automatic backups. You can  retain
                                      automatic  backups  for  a maximum of 90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags
                                      on  the  file system are copied to back-
                                      ups. If it's set to true,  all  tags  on
                                      the  file system are copied to all auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups  where  the user doesn't specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are
                                      copied  from the file system, regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The type of drive cache used by  PERSIS-
                                      TENT_1 file systems that are provisioned
                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is  required  when  StorageType  is HDD.
                                      When set to READ the file system has  an
                                      SSD  storage  cache that is sized to 20%
                                      of the file system's  storage  capacity.
                                      This  improves  the performance for fre-
                                      quently accessed files by caching up  to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This  parameter  is  required when Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      The data compression  configuration  for
                                      the file system. DataCompressionType can
                                      have the following values:

                                      o NONE - Data compression is turned  off
                                        for the file system.

                                      o LZ4  -  Data  compression is turned on
                                        with the LZ4 algorithm.

                                          The data repository events that  are
                                          logged by Amazon FSx.

                                          o WARN_ONLY  -  only  warning events
                                            are logged.

                                          o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are
                                            logged.

                                          o WARN_ERROR  -  both warning events
                                            and error events are logged.

                                          o DISABLED - logging of data reposi-
                                            tory events is turned off.

                                          Note  that  Amazon File Cache uses a

                                      RootSquash -> (string)
                                          You enable root squash by setting  a
                                          user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) for
                                          the  file  system  in   the   format
                                          UID:GID  (for  example, 365534:65534
                                          ). The UID and GID values can  range
                                          from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                          o A  non-zero  value for UID and GID
                                            enables root squash. The  UID  and
                                            GID  values  can be different, but
                                            each must be a non-zero value.

                                          o A value of 0 (zero)  for  UID  and
                                            GID  indicates root, and therefore
                                            disables root squash.

                                          When root  squash  is  enabled,  the
                                          user  ID and group ID of a root user
                                          accessing  the   file   system   are
                                          re-mapped  to  the  UID  and GID you
                                          provide.

                                      NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                          When root squash is enabled, you can
                                          optionally  specify an array of NIDs
                                          of clients  for  which  root  squash
                                          does  not  apply.  A client NID is a
                                          Lustre Network  Identifier  used  to
                                          uniquely  identify a client. You can
                                          specify the NID as either  a  single
                                          address or a range of addresses:

                                          o A  single  address is described in
                                            standard  Lustre  NID  format   by
                                            specifying  the clients IP address
                                            followed by the Lustre network  ID
                                            (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                                          o An  address range is described us-
                                            ing a dash to separate  the  range
                                            (for                      example,
                                            10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                                      The  number  of days to retain automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables  automatic backups. You can retain
                                      automatic backups for a  maximum  of  90
                                      days. The default is 30 .

                                      on the file system should be  copied  to
                                      backups.  If it's set to true , all tags
                                      on the file system are copied to all au-
                                      tomatic  backups  and any user-initiated
                                      backups where the user  doesn't  specify
                                      any  tags. If this value is true and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated   backup,   no  tags  are
                                      copied from the file system,  regardless

                                      A  Boolean value indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  flag indicating whether this
                                      volume is the root volume for its  stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume on an SVM can be  the  root  volume.
                                      This  value  defaults to false . If this
                                      value is true , then  this  is  the  SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an SVM, because you  must  first  delete
                                      all  non-root  volumes.  This flag, when
                                      set to false , helps you identify  which
                                      volumes  to delete before you can delete

                                          o AUTO - moves cold  user  data  and
                                            snapshots  to  the  capacity  pool
                                            storage tier based on your  access
                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL  -  moves all user data blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The  volume's universally unique identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW  specifies  a read/write volume. RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster  occurs,  you  can  use these
                                        data-protection mirror copies  to  re-
                                        cover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume. A load-sharing mirror  reduces
                                        the  network traffic to a FlexVol vol-
                                        ume by providing additional  read-only
                                        access to clients.

                                   SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  snapshot  policy for the
                                      volume. There are three  built-in  snap-
                                      shot policies:

                                      o default  : This is the default policy.
                                        A  maximum  of  six  hourly  snapshots
                                        taken  five  minutes  past the hour. A
                                        maximum of two daily  snapshots  taken
                                        Monday  through Saturday at 10 minutes
                                        after  midnight.  A  maximum  of   two
                                        weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at
                                        15 minutes after midnight.

                                      o default-1weekly : This policy  is  the
                                        same as the default policy except that
                                        it only retains one snapshot from  the
                                        weekly schedule.

                                      o none  :  This policy does not take any
                                        snapshots. This policy can be assigned
                                        to  volumes to prevent automatic snap-
                                        shots from being taken.

                                      You can also provide the name of a  cus-
                                      tom policy that you created with the ON-
                                      TAP CLI or REST API.

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to back-
                                      ups. This value defaults  to  false.  If
                                      it's  set to true, all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are  copied  to  all  automatic  and
                                      user-initiated  backups  where  the user
                                      doesn't specify tags. If this  value  is
                                      true,  and you specify one or more tags,
                                      only the specified tags  are  copied  to
                                      backups. If you specify one or more tags
                                      when creating a  user-initiated  backup,
                                      no  tags are copied from the volume, re-
                                      gardless of this value.

                                   Services resources. We require an ARN  when
                                   you  need  to  specify a resource unambigu-
                                   ously across all of  Amazon  Web  Services.

                                          be  unique for the resource to which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the  TagValue

                                        sion ratio to minimize on-disk storage
                                        utilization.

                                        ume  using  the  LZ4 compression algo-
                                        rithm. Compared to Z-Standard, LZ4  is
                                        less  compute-intensive  and  delivers
                                        higher write throughput speeds.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean value indicating whether  tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are copied to  snapshots  where  the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is true and  you  specify  one  or  more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are copied from the  volume,  regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration object that specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given resource. ARNs uniquely  iden-
                                          tify  Amazon Web Services resources.
                                          We require an ARN when you  need  to
                                          specify   a  resource  unambiguously
                                          across all of Amazon  Web  Services.

                                          The  strategy used when copying data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE - The new volume  references
                                            the  data  in the origin snapshot.
                                            Cloning a snapshot is faster  than
                                            copying  the  data from a snapshot
                                            to a new volume and  doesn't  con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin snapshot can't  be  deleted
                                            if  there  is  a  volume using its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY - Copies all  data  from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  value indicating whether the
                                      volume is read-only.
