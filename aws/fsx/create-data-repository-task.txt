CREATE-DATA-REPOSITORY-TASK()                    CREATE-DATA-REPOSITORY-TASK()



NAME
       create-data-repository-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon  FSx  for Lustre data repository task. You use data
       repository tasks to perform bulk operations  between  your  Amazon  FSx
       file  system  and  its  linked  data repositories. An example of a data
       repository task is exporting any data and metadata  changes,  including
       POSIX  metadata,  to  files, directories, and symbolic links (symlinks)
       from your FSx file system  to  a  linked  data  repository.  A  Create-
       DataRepositoryTask  operation  will  fail  if  a data repository is not
       linked to the FSx file system. To  learn  more  about  data  repository
       tasks,  see  Data Repository Tasks . To learn more about linking a data
       repository to your file system, see Linking your file system to  an  S3
       bucket .

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          Specifies the type of data repository task to create.

          Possible values:

          o EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY

          o IMPORT_METADATA_FROM_REPOSITORY

       --paths (list)
          A list of paths for the data repository task to use when the task is
          processed. If a path that you provide isn't valid, the task fails.

          o For export tasks, the list contains paths on the Amazon  FSx  file
            system  from which the files are exported to the Amazon S3 bucket.
            The default path is the file system root directory. The paths  you
            provide need to be relative to the mount point of the file system.
            If the mount point is /mnt/fsx and /mnt/fsx/path1 is  a  directory
            or  file  on  the file system you want to export, then the path to
            provide is path1 .

          o For import tasks, the list contains paths in the Amazon S3  bucket
            from  which  POSIX metadata changes are imported to the Amazon FSx
            file system. The path can be an S3 bucket or prefix in the  format
            s3://myBucket/myPrefix (where myPrefix is optional).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --file-system-id (string)
          The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon FSx.

       --report (structure)
          Defines  whether  or not Amazon FSx provides a CompletionReport once
          the task has completed. A CompletionReport provides a  detailed  re-
          port  on  the files that Amazon FSx processed that meet the criteria
          specified by the Scope parameter. For more information, see  Working
          with Task Completion Reports .

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Set Enabled to True to generate a CompletionReport when the task
              completes. If set to true , then you need to  provide  a  report
              Scope  ,  Path , and Format . Set Enabled to False if you do not
              want a CompletionReport generated when the task completes.

          Path -> (string)
              Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the  location  of
              the  report  on  the file system's linked S3 data repository. An
              absolute path that defines where the completion report  will  be
              stored in the destination location. The Path you provide must be
              located within the file  systems  ExportPath.  An  example  Path
              value is "s3://myBucket/myExportPath/optionalPrefix". The report
              provides the following information for each file in the  report:
              FilePath,  FileStatus, and ErrorCode. To learn more about a file
              system's ExportPath , see .

          Format -> (string)
              Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the format of the
              CompletionReport  .  REPORT_CSV_20191124 is the only format cur-
              rently supported. When Format is set  to  REPORT_CSV_20191124  ,
              the CompletionReport is provided in CSV format, and is delivered
              to {path}/task-{id}/failures.csv .

          Scope -> (string)
              Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the scope of  the
              CompletionReport ; FAILED_FILES_ONLY is the only scope currently
              supported. When Scope is set to FAILED_FILES_ONLY , the  Comple-
              tionReport  only  contains information about files that the data
              repository task failed to process.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,Path=string,Format=string,Scope=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,

            "Format": "REPORT_CSV_20191124",
            "Scope": "FAILED_FILES_ONLY"
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in  a  string
          of  up to 64 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --tags (list)
          A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag. Tag
                 keys must be unique for the resource to which  they  are  at-
                 tached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned to
                 the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and  don't
                 have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a
                 key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April and  also  of
                 payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              NOTE:
                 You  cannot delete an FSx for Lustre file system if there are
                 data repository tasks for the file system in the  PENDING  or
                 EXECUTING  states. Please retry when the data repository task
                 is finished (with a status  of  CANCELED  ,  SUCCEEDED  ,  or
                 FAILED  ).  You can use the DescribeDataRepositoryTask action
                 to monitor the task status. Contact the FSx team if you  need
                 to delete your file system immediately.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of data repository task.

              o The  EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY  data  repository  task exports from
                your Lustre file system from to a linked S3 bucket.

              o The IMPORT_METADATA_FROM_REPOSITORY data repository  task  im-
                ports  metadata changes from a linked S3 bucket to your Lustre
                file system.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that  the  resource  was  created,  in  seconds  (since
              1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

              lated after the task is complete.

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a  given  resource.  ARNs
              uniquely  identify  Amazon Web Services resources. We require an
              ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all
              of  Amazon  Web  Services.  For more information, see Amazon Re-
              source Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
              .

          Tags -> (list)
              A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag.
                     Tag keys must be unique for the resource  to  which  they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned
                     to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and
                     don't  have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you
                     can have a key-value pair in a  tag  set  of  finances  :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

          FileSystemId -> (string)
              The  globally  unique  ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon
              FSx.

          Paths -> (list)
              An array of paths on the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system  that
              specify  the  data  for the data repository task to process. For
              example, in an  EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY  task,  the  paths  specify
              which data to export to the linked data repository.

              (Default)  If  Paths  is not specified, Amazon FSx uses the file
              system root directory.

              (string)

          FailureDetails -> (structure)
              Failure message describing why the task failed, it is  populated
              only when Lifecycle is set to FAILED .

              Message -> (string)
                 A detailed error message.

          Status -> (structure)
              Provides  the  status  of  the number of files that the task has
              processed successfully and failed to process.

              TotalCount -> (long)
                 The total number of files that the task will process. While a
                 task is executing, the sum of SucceededCount plus FailedCount
                 may not equal TotalCount . When the task is complete,  Total-
                 Count equals the sum of SucceededCount plus FailedCount .

              SucceededCount -> (long)
                 A running total of the number of files that the task has suc-
                 cessfully processed.

              FailedCount -> (long)
                 A running total of the number of files that the  task  failed
                 to process.

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the task status was last updated.

          Report -> (structure)
              Provides  a report detailing the data repository task results of
              the files processed that match the criteria specified in the re-
              port  Scope  parameter. FSx delivers the report to the file sys-
              tem's linked data repository in Amazon S3, using the path speci-
              fied  in  the  report Path parameter. You can specify whether or
              not a report gets generated for a task using the Enabled parame-
              ter.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Set  Enabled  to True to generate a CompletionReport when the
                 task completes. If set to true , then you need to  provide  a
                 report  Scope  ,  Path , and Format . Set Enabled to False if
                 you do not want a CompletionReport generated  when  the  task
                 completes.

              Path -> (string)
                 Required  if  Enabled is set to true . Specifies the location
                 of the report on the file system's linked S3 data repository.
                 An  absolute  path  that  defines where the completion report
                 will be stored in the destination location. The Path you pro-
                 vide  must  be located within the file systems ExportPath. An
                 example Path value  is  "s3://myBucket/myExportPath/optional-
                 Prefix".  The  report  provides the following information for
                 each file in the report: FilePath, FileStatus, and ErrorCode.
                 To learn more about a file system's ExportPath , see .

              Format -> (string)
                 Required  if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the format of
                 the CompletionReport . REPORT_CSV_20191124 is the only format
                 currently    supported.   When   Format   is   set   to   RE-
                 PORT_CSV_20191124 , the CompletionReport is provided  in  CSV
                 format, and is delivered to {path}/task-{id}/failures.csv .

              Scope -> (string)
                 Required  if  Enabled is set to true . Specifies the scope of
                 the CompletionReport ; FAILED_FILES_ONLY is  the  only  scope
                 currently supported. When Scope is set to FAILED_FILES_ONLY ,
                 the CompletionReport only contains  information  about  files
                 that the data repository task failed to process.
