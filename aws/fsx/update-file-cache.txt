OPTIONS
       --file-cache-id (string)
          The ID of the cache that you are updating.

       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in  a  string
          of  up to 63 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --lustre-configuration (structure)
          The configuration updates for an Amazon File Cache resource.

          WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
              A recurring weekly time, in the format D:HH:MM .
                 D is the day of the week, for which 1 represents Monday and 7
                 represents Sunday. For further details, see the ISO-8601 spec
                 as described on Wikipedia .

                 HH  is  the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM is the
                 zero-padded minute of the hour.

              For example, 1:05:00 specifies maintenance at 5 AM Monday.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              A list of subnet IDs that the cache will be accessible from. You
              can specify only one subnet ID in a call to the  CreateFileCache
              operation.

              (string)
                 The  ID  for a subnet. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              Specifies  the ID of the Key Management Service (KMS) key to use
              for encrypting data on an Amazon File Cache. If a KmsKeyId isn't
              specified,  the  Amazon  FSx-managed KMS key for your account is
              used. For more information, see Encrypt in  the  Key  Management
              Service API Reference .

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a  given resource. ARNs
              uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources. We  require  an
              ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all
              of Amazon Web Services. For more  information,  see  Amazon  Re-
              source Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
              .

                 Per unit storage throughput represents the megabytes per sec-
                 ond  of  read  or  write throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage
                 provisioned. Cache throughput capacity is  equal  to  Storage
                 capacity  (TiB)  *  PerUnitStorageThroughput  (MB/s/TiB). The
                 only supported value is 1000 .

                 The deployment type of the Amazon File Cache resource,  which
                 must be CACHE_1 .

              MountName -> (string)
                 You  use  the MountName value when mounting the cache. If you
                 pass a cache ID to the DescribeFileCaches operation,  it  re-
                 turns the the MountName value as part of the cache's descrip-
                 tion.

              WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                 A recurring weekly time, in the format D:HH:MM .
                     D is the day of the week, for which 1  represents  Monday
                     and  7  represents  Sunday.  For further details, see the

                     HH is the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and  MM  is
                     the zero-padded minute of the hour.

                 For example, 1:05:00 specifies maintenance at 5 AM Monday.

              MetadataConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  configuration for a Lustre MDT (Metadata Target) storage
                 volume.

                 StorageCapacity -> (integer)
                     The storage capacity of the Lustre MDT (Metadata  Target)
                     storage  volume  in  gibibytes  (GiB). The only supported
                     value is 2400 GiB.

              LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for Lustre logging used to  write  the  en-
                 abled  logging  events for your Amazon File Cache resource to
                 Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                 Level -> (string)
                     The data repository events that are logged by Amazon FSx.

                     o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                     o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                     o WARN_ERROR - both warning events and error  events  are
                       logged.

                     o DISABLED  - logging of data repository events is turned
                       off.

                     Note that Amazon File Cache uses  a  default  setting  of
                     WARN_ERROR , which can't be changed.

                 Destination -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that specifies the desti-
                     nation of the logs. The destination  can  be  any  Amazon
                     CloudWatch  Logs  log group ARN. The destination ARN must
                     be in the same Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon  Web
                     Services  Region, and Amazon Web Services account as your
                     Amazon FSx file system.

          DataRepositoryAssociationIds -> (list)
              A list of IDs of data repository associations that  are  associ-
              ated with this cache.
