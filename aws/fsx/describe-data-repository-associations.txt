NAME
       describe-data-repository-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  description  of  specific Amazon FSx for Lustre or Amazon
       File Cache data repository associations, if one or more  AssociationIds
       values  are  provided in the request, or if filters are used in the re-
       quest. Data repository associations are supported on Amazon File  Cache
       resources and all FSx for Lustre 2.12 and newer file systems, excluding
       scratch_1 deployment type.

       You can use filters to narrow the response to include just data reposi-
       tory  associations  for  specific  file systems (use the file-system-id
       filter with the ID of the file system) or caches (use the file-cache-id
       filter with the ID of the cache), or data repository associations for a
       specific repository type (use the data-repository-type  filter  with  a
       value  of  S3  or NFS ). If you don't use filters, the response returns
       all data repository associations owned by your Amazon Web Services  ac-
       count  in  the  Amazon  Web Services Region of the endpoint that you're
       calling.

       When retrieving all data repository associations, you can paginate  the
       response by using the optional MaxResults parameter to limit the number
       of data repository associations returned in a response.  If  more  data
       repository  associations  remain,  a NextToken value is returned in the
       response. In this case, send a later request with the NextToken request
       parameter set to the value of NextToken from the last response.

OPTIONS
       --association-ids (list)
          IDs  of the data repository associations whose descriptions you want
          to retrieve (String).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          A list of Filter elements.

          (structure)
              A filter used to restrict the results of describe calls. You can
              use  multiple  filters  to  return results that meet all applied
              filter requirements.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name for this filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of the filter. These are all the values for any of
                 the applied filters.

                 (string)
                     The value for a filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "file-system-id"|"backup-type"|"file-system-type"|"volume-id"|"data-repository-type"|"file-cache-id"|"file-cache-type",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  resources  to return in the response. This
          value must be an integer greater than zero.

       --next-token (string)
          (Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a  previous  opera-
          tion  (String). If present, this token indicates from what point you
          can continue processing the request, where  the  previous  NextToken
          value left off.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Associations -> (list)
          An array of one or more data repository association descriptions.

          (structure)
              The configuration of a data repository association that links an
              Amazon  FSx  for Lustre file system to an Amazon S3 bucket or an
              Amazon File Cache resource to an Amazon S3 bucket or an NFS file
              system.  The data repository association configuration object is
              returned in the response of the following operations:

              o CreateDataRepositoryAssociation

              o UpdateDataRepositoryAssociation

              o DescribeDataRepositoryAssociations

              Data repository associations are supported on Amazon File  Cache
              resources  and  all  FSx for Lustre 2.12 and newer file systems,
              excluding scratch_1 deployment type.

              AssociationId -> (string)
                 The system-generated, unique ID of the data repository  asso-
                 ciation.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for a given resource. ARNs
                 uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources.  We  require
                 an  ARN  when  you  need  to specify a resource unambiguously
                 across all of Amazon Web Services. For more information,  see
                 Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services Gen-
                 eral Reference .

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon
                 FSx.

              Lifecycle -> (string)
                 Describes  the  state  of  a data repository association. The
                 lifecycle can have the following values:

                 o CREATING - The data repository association between the file
                   system  or  cache and the data repository is being created.
                   The data repository is unavailable.

                 o AVAILABLE - The data repository  association  is  available
                   for use.

                 o MISCONFIGURED  - The data repository association is miscon-
                   figured. Until the configuration  is  corrected,  automatic
                   import  and automatic export will not work (only for Amazon
                   FSx for Lustre).

                 o UPDATING - The data repository association is undergoing  a
                   customer  initiated update that might affect its availabil-
                   ity.

                 o DELETING - The data repository association is undergoing  a
                   customer initiated deletion.

                 o FAILED  -  The data repository association is in a terminal
                   state that cannot be recovered.

              FailureDetails -> (structure)
                 Provides detailed information about the  data  repository  if
                 its Lifecycle is set to MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

                 Message -> (string)
                     A detailed error message.

              FileSystemPath -> (string)
                 A  path  on the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that points
                 to a high-level directory (such as /ns1/  )  or  subdirectory
                 (such  as  /ns1/subdir/  )  that  will  be  mapped  1-1  with
                 DataRepositoryPath . The leading forward slash in the name is
                 required.  Two data repository associations cannot have over-
                 lapping file system paths. For example, if a data  repository
                 is  associated  with file system path /ns1/ , then you cannot
                 link another data repository with file system path /ns1/ns2 .

                 This path specifies where in your file system files  will  be
                 exported  from or imported to. This file system directory can
                 be linked to only one Amazon  S3  bucket,  and  no  other  S3
                 bucket can be linked to the directory.

                 NOTE:
                     If you specify only a forward slash (/ ) as the file sys-
                     tem path, you can link only one data  repository  to  the
                     file  system. You can only specify "/" as the file system
                     path for the first data repository associated with a file
                     system.

              DataRepositoryPath -> (string)
                 The  path  to  the data repository that will be linked to the
                 cache or file system.

                 o For Amazon File Cache, the path can be an NFS data  reposi-
                   tory  that  will be linked to the cache. The path can be in
                   one of two formats:

                   o If you are not using the DataRepositorySubdirectories pa-
                     rameter,  the  path is to an NFS Export directory (or one
                     of  its  subdirectories)  in  the  format   nsf://nfs-do-
                     main-name/exportpath  .  You  can therefore link a single
                     NFS Export to a single data repository association.

                   o If you are using the DataRepositorySubdirectories parame-
                     ter,  the  path is the domain name of the NFS file system
                     in the format nfs://filer-domain-name ,  which  indicates
                     the   root  of  the  subdirectories  specified  with  the
                     DataRepositorySubdirectories parameter.

                 o For Amazon File Cache, the path can be an S3 bucket or pre-
                   fix in the format s3://myBucket/myPrefix/ .

                 o For  Amazon FSx for Lustre, the path can be an S3 bucket or
                   prefix in the format s3://myBucket/myPrefix/ .

              BatchImportMetaDataOnCreate -> (boolean)
                 A boolean flag indicating whether an import  data  repository
                 task  to import metadata should run after the data repository
                 association is created. The task runs if this flag is set  to
                 true .

                 NOTE:
                     BatchImportMetaDataOnCreate  is  not  supported  for data
                     repositories linked to an Amazon File Cache resource.

              ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                 For files imported from a data repository, this value  deter-
                 mines  the  stripe  count and maximum amount of data per file
                 (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum number
                 of  disks that a single file can be striped across is limited
                 by the total number of disks that make up the file system  or
                 cache.

                 The  default  chunk  size  is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as
                 high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maxi-
                 mum size of 5 TB.

              S3 -> (structure)
                 The  configuration for an Amazon S3 data repository linked to
                 an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system with a  data  repository
                 association.

                 AutoImportPolicy -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the  type  of  updated  objects (new, changed,
                     deleted) that will be  automatically  imported  from  the
                     linked S3 bucket to your file system.

                     Events -> (list)
                        The AutoImportPolicy can have the following event val-
                        ues:

                        o NEW - Amazon FSx automatically imports  metadata  of
                          files added to the linked S3 bucket that do not cur-
                          rently exist in the FSx file system.

                        o CHANGED -  Amazon  FSx  automatically  updates  file
                          metadata  and  invalidates  existing file content on
                          the file system as files change in the data  reposi-
                          tory.

                        o DELETED  - Amazon FSx automatically deletes files on
                          the file system as corresponding files  are  deleted
                          in the data repository.

                        You can define any combination of event types for your
                        AutoImportPolicy .

                        (string)

                 AutoExportPolicy -> (structure)
                     Specifies the type  of  updated  objects  (new,  changed,
                     deleted)  that  will  be automatically exported from your
                     file system to the linked S3 bucket.

                     Events -> (list)
                        The AutoExportPolicy can have the following event val-
                        ues:

                        o NEW  -  New  files and directories are automatically
                          exported to the data repository as they are added to
                          the file system.

                        o CHANGED  -  Changes  to files and directories on the
                          file system are automatically exported to  the  data
                          repository.

                        o DELETED  -  Files  and directories are automatically
                          deleted on the data repository when they are deleted
                          on the file system.

                        You can define any combination of event types for your
                        AutoExportPolicy .

                        (string)

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        A value that specifies the TagKey , the  name  of  the
                        tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which
                        they are attached.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A value that specifies the TagValue ,  the  value  as-
                        signed to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be
                        null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For ex-
                        ample,  you  can have a key-value pair in a tag set of
                        finances : April and also of payroll : April .

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the resource was  created,  in  seconds  (since
                 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

              FileCacheId -> (string)
                 The globally unique ID of the Amazon File Cache resource.

              FileCachePath -> (string)
                 A  path  on the Amazon File Cache that points to a high-level
                 directory (such as /ns1/ ) or subdirectory (such as /ns1/sub-
                 dir/  ) that will be mapped 1-1 with DataRepositoryPath . The
                 leading forward slash in  the  path  is  required.  Two  data
                 repository  associations cannot have overlapping cache paths.
                 For example, if a data repository is  associated  with  cache
                 path  /ns1/  ,  then  you cannot link another data repository
                 with cache path /ns1/ns2 .

                 This path specifies the directory in your cache  where  files
                 will  be exported from. This cache directory can be linked to
                 only one data repository (S3 or NFS) and no other data repos-
                 itory can be linked to the directory.

                 NOTE:
                     The  cache path can only be set to root (/) on an NFS DRA
                     when DataRepositorySubdirectories is  specified.  If  you
                     specify  root  (/) as the cache path, you can create only
                     one DRA on the cache.

                     The cache path cannot be set to root (/) for an S3 DRA.

              DataRepositorySubdirectories -> (list)
                 For Amazon File Cache, a list of NFS  Exports  that  will  be
                 linked  with an NFS data repository association. All the sub-
                 directories must be on a single NFS file system.  The  Export
                 paths are in the format /exportpath1 . To use this parameter,
                 you must configure DataRepositoryPath as the domain  name  of
                 the  NFS  file system. The NFS file system domain name in ef-
                 fect is the root of the subdirectories. Note that DataReposi-
                 torySubdirectories is not supported for S3 data repositories.

                 (string)

              NFS -> (structure)
                 The  configuration  for  an  NFS data repository linked to an
                 Amazon File Cache resource with a  data  repository  associa-
                 tion.

                 Version -> (string)
                     The  version of the NFS (Network File System) protocol of
                     the NFS data repository. Currently,  the  only  supported
                     value  is NFS3 , which indicates that the data repository
                     must support the NFSv3 protocol.

                 DnsIps -> (list)
                     A list of up to 2 IP addresses of DNS servers used to re-
                     solve  the  NFS  file system domain name. The provided IP
                     addresses can either be the IP addresses of  a  DNS  for-
                     warder or resolver that the customer manages and runs in-
                     side the  customer  VPC,  or  the  IP  addresses  of  the
                     on-premises DNS servers.

                     (string)

                 AutoExportPolicy -> (structure)
                     This parameter is not supported for Amazon File Cache.

                     Events -> (list)
                        The AutoExportPolicy can have the following event val-
                        ues:

                        o NEW - New files and  directories  are  automatically
                          exported to the data repository as they are added to
                          the file system.

                        o CHANGED - Changes to files and  directories  on  the
                          file  system  are automatically exported to the data
                          repository.

                        o DELETED - Files and  directories  are  automatically
                          deleted on the data repository when they are deleted
                          on the file system.

                        You can define any combination of event types for your
                        AutoExportPolicy .

                        (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          (Optional)  Opaque  pagination token returned from a previous opera-
          tion (String). If present, this token indicates from what point  you
          can  continue  processing  the request, where the previous NextToken
          value left off.
