DELETE-FILE-CACHE()                                        DELETE-FILE-CACHE()



NAME
       delete-file-cache -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an  Amazon  File  Cache resource. After deletion, the cache no
       longer exists, and its data is gone.

       The DeleteFileCache operation returns while the cache has the  DELETING
       status.  You  can  check  the  cache  deletion  status  by  calling the
       DescribeFileCaches operation, which returns a list of  caches  in  your
       account.  If  you  pass  the  cache  ID  for  a  deleted cache, the De-
       scribeFileCaches operation returns a FileCacheNotFound error.

       WARNING:
          The data in a deleted cache is also deleted and can't  be  recovered
          by any means.

OPTIONS
       --file-cache-id (string)
          The ID of the cache that's being deleted.

       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional)  An  idempotency token for resource creation, in a string
          of up to 63 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled  on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

          The ID of the cache that's being deleted.
