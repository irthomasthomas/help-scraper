GET-SERVICE-GRAPH()                                        GET-SERVICE-GRAPH()



NAME
       get-service-graph -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a document that describes services that process incoming re-
       quests, and downstream services that they call as a result.  Root  ser-
       vices  process incoming requests and make calls to downstream services.
       Root services are applications that use the Amazon Web  Services  X-Ray
       SDK  .  Downstream  services can be other applications, Amazon Web Ser-
       vices resources, HTTP web APIs, or SQL databases.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-service-graph is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Services

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time frame for which to generate a graph.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the timeframe for which to generate a graph.

       --group-name (string)
          The name of a group based on which you want to generate a graph.

       --group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a group based on which you want to
          generate a graph.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a service graph

       The  following  example displays a document within a specified time pe-
       riod that describes services  processing  incoming  requests,  and  the
       downstream services that they call as a result.:

              that made requests, or downstream services, resources,  and  ap-
              plications that an application used.

                 name.

                 (string)

              Root -> (boolean)
                 Indicates that the service was the first service to process a
                 request.

                 (structure)
                     Information about a connection between two  services.  An
                     edge  can  be  a  synchronous connection, such as typical
                     call between client and service, or an asynchronous link,
                     such  as  a Lambda function which retrieves an event from
                     an SNS queue.

                     ReferenceId -> (integer)

                        ErrorStatistics -> (structure)
                            Information  about requests that failed with a 4xx
