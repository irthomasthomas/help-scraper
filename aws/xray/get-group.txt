          [--group-name <value>]
          [--group-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The case-sensitive name of the group.

       --group-arn (string)
          The ARN of the group that was generated on creation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a group

       The  following  get-group  example  displays  details for the specified
       group resource. The details include the group name, the group ARN,  and
       the  filter expression that defines the criteria for that group. Groups
       can also be retrieved by ARN.

          aws xray get-group \
              --group-name "AdminGroup"

       Output:

          {
              "Group": [
                  {
                      "GroupName": "AdminGroup",
                      "GroupARN": "arn:aws:xray:us-west-2:123456789012:group/AdminGroup/123456789",
                      "FilterExpression": "service(\"mydomain.com\") {fault OR error}"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Settings with the AWS X-Ray API in the AWS X-Ray Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The  group  that  was requested. Contains the name of the group, the
          ARN of the group, the filter expression, and the insight  configura-
          tion assigned to the group.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The unique case-sensitive name of the group.

          GroupARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the group generated based on
              the GroupName.

          FilterExpression -> (string)
              The filter expression defining the parameters to include traces.

          InsightsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The structure containing configurations related to insights.

              o The InsightsEnabled boolean can be set to true to  enable  in-
                sights  for  the  group  or  false to disable insights for the
                group.

              o The NotificationsEnabled boolean can be set to true to  enable
                insights  notifications  through  Amazon  EventBridge  for the
                group.

              InsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set the InsightsEnabled value to true to enable  insights  or
                 false to disable insights.

              NotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set the NotificationsEnabled value to true to enable insights
                 notifications. Notifications can only be enabled on  a  group
                 with InsightsEnabled set to true.
