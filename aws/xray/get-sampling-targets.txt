OPTIONS
       --sampling-statistics-documents (list)
          Information about rules that the service  is  using  to  sample  re-
          quests.

          (structure)
              Request  sampling  results for a single rule from a service. Re-
              sults are for the last 10 seconds unless the  service  has  been
              assigned  a  longer  reporting interval after a previous call to
              GetSamplingTargets .

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the sampling rule.

              ClientID -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the service in hexadecimal.

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The current time.

              RequestCount -> (integer)
                 The number of requests that matched the rule.

              SampledCount -> (integer)
                 The number of requests recorded.

              BorrowCount -> (integer)
                 The number  of  requests  recorded  with  borrowed  reservoir
                 quota.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RuleName=string,ClientID=string,Timestamp=timestamp,RequestCount=integer,SampledCount=integer,BorrowCount=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RuleName": "string",
              "ClientID": "string",
              "Timestamp": timestamp,
              "RequestCount": integer,
              "SampledCount": integer,
              "BorrowCount": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To request a sampling quota

       The following get-sampling-targets example requests  a  sampling  quota
       for  rules  that  the service is using to sample requests. The response
       from AWS X-Ray includes a quota that can be used instead  of  borrowing
       from the reservoir.

          aws xray get-sampling-targets \
              --sampling-statistics-documents '[ { "RuleName": "base-scorekeep", "ClientID": "ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF10", "Timestamp": "2018-07-07T00:20:06, "RequestCount": 110, "SampledCount": 20, "BorrowCount": 10 }, { "RuleName": "polling-scorekeep", 31, "BorrowCount": 0 } ]'

OUTPUT
       SamplingTargetDocuments -> (list)
          Updated rules that the service should use to sample requests.

          (structure)
              Temporary changes to a sampling rule configuration. To meet  the
              global sampling target for a rule, X-Ray calculates a new reser-
              voir for each service based on the recent  sampling  results  of
              all services that called GetSamplingTargets .

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the sampling rule.

              FixedRate -> (double)
                 The  percentage of matching requests to instrument, after the
                 reservoir is exhausted.

              ReservoirQuota -> (integer)
                 The number of requests per second that  X-Ray  allocated  for
                 this service.

              ReservoirQuotaTTL -> (timestamp)
                 When the reservoir quota expires.

              Interval -> (integer)
                 The  number of seconds for the service to wait before getting
                 sampling targets again.

       LastRuleModification -> (timestamp)
          The last time a user changed the sampling rule configuration. If the
          sampling rule configuration changed since the service last retrieved
          it, the service should call GetSamplingRules to get the latest  ver-
          sion.

       UnprocessedStatistics -> (list)
          Information  about  SamplingStatisticsDocument  that X-Ray could not
          process.

          (structure)
              Sampling statistics from a call to GetSamplingTargets that X-Ray
              could not process.

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the sampling rule.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code.

              Message -> (string)
                 The error message.
