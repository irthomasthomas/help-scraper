OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The case-sensitive name of the new group. Default is a reserved name
          and names must be unique.

       --filter-expression (string)
          The filter expression defining criteria by which to group traces.

       --insights-configuration (structure)
          The structure containing configurations related to insights.

          o The InsightsEnabled boolean can be set to true to enable  insights
            for the new group or false to disable insights for the new group.

          o The  NotificationsEnabled boolean can be set to true to enable in-
            sights notifications for the new group. Notifications may only  be
            enabled on a group with InsightsEnabled set to true.

          InsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Set  the  InsightsEnabled  value  to  true to enable insights or
              false to disable insights.

          NotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)

              notifications. Notifications can only be enabled on a group with
              InsightsEnabled set to true.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InsightsEnabled=boolean,NotificationsEnabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

       --tags (list)
          A map that contains one or more tag keys and tag values to attach to
          an  X-Ray  group.  For  more information about ways to use tags, see
          Tagging Amazon Web Services resources in  the  Amazon  Web  Services
          General Reference .

          The following restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum tag value length: 256 Unicode characters

          o Valid values for key and value: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, space, and the fol-
            lowing characters: _ . : / = + - and @

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Don't use aws: as a prefix for keys; it's reserved for Amazon  Web
            Services use.

          (structure)
              A map that contains tag keys and tag values to attach to an Ama-
              zon Web Services X-Ray group or sampling rule. For more informa-
              tion about ways to use tags, see Tagging Amazon Web Services re-
              sources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

              The following restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of user-applied tags per resource: 50

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Don't use aws: as a prefix for keys; it's reserved for  Amazon
                Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete system tags.

              Key -> (string)
                 A tag key, such as Stage or Name . A tag key cannot be empty.
                 The key can be a maximum of 128 characters, and  can  contain
                 only  Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the follow-

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a group

       The following create-group example creates a group resource  named  Ad-
       minGroup.  The group gets a filter expression that defines the criteria
       of the group as a segment related to a specific service causing a fault
       or an error.

          aws xray create-group \
             --group-name "AdminGroup" \
             --filter-expression "service(\"mydomain.com\") {fault OR error}"

       Output:

          {
              "GroupName": "AdminGroup",
              "GroupARN": "arn:aws:xray:us-west-2:123456789012:group/AdminGroup/123456789",
              "FilterExpression": "service(\"mydomain.com\") {fault OR error}"
          }

       For  more information, see Configuring Sampling, Groups, and Encryption
       Settings with the AWS X-Ray API in the AWS X-Ray Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The group that was created. Contains the name of the group that  was
          created, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the group that was gener-
          ated based on the group name, the filter expression, and the insight
          configuration that was assigned to the group.

          GroupName -> (string)

              The filter expression defining the parameters to include traces.

          InsightsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The structure containing configurations related to insights.

              o The InsightsEnabled boolean can be set to true to  enable  in-
                sights  for  the  group  or  false to disable insights for the
                group.

              o The NotificationsEnabled boolean can be set to true to  enable
                insights  notifications  through  Amazon  EventBridge  for the
                group.

              InsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set the InsightsEnabled value to true to enable  insights  or
                 false to disable insights.

              NotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set the NotificationsEnabled value to true to enable insights
                 notifications. Notifications can only be enabled on  a  group
                 with InsightsEnabled set to true.
