PUT-TRACE-SEGMENTS()                                      PUT-TRACE-SEGMENTS()



NAME
       put-trace-segments -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads segment documents to Amazon Web Services X-Ray. A segment docu-
       ment can be a completed segment, an in-progress segment, or an array of
       subsegments.

       Segments  must include the following fields. For the full segment docu-
       ment schema, see Amazon Web Services X-Ray  Segment  Documents  in  the
       Amazon Web Services X-Ray Developer Guide .
          Required segment document fields

       o name - The name of the service that handled the request.

       o id  -  A  64-bit identifier for the segment, unique among segments in
         the same trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits.

       o trace_id - A unique identifier that connects all segments and subseg-
         ments originating from a single client request.

       o start_time  - Time the segment or subsegment was created, in floating
         point seconds in epoch time, accurate to milliseconds.  For  example,
         1480615200.010 or 1.480615200010E9 .

       o end_time  -  Time  the segment or subsegment was closed. For example,
         1480615200.090 or 1.480615200090E9 . Specify either  an  end_time  or
         in_progress .

       o in_progress - Set to true instead of specifying an end_time to record
         that a segment has  been  started,  but  is  not  complete.  Send  an
         in-progress  segment  when  your  application receives a request that
         will take a long time to serve, to trace that  the  request  was  re-
         ceived. When the response is sent, send the complete segment to over-
         write the in-progress segment.

       A trace_id consists of three numbers separated by hyphens. For example,
       1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979.  For trace IDs created by an X-Ray
       SDK, or by Amazon Web Services services integrated with X-Ray, a  trace
       ID includes:
          Trace ID Format

       o The version number, for instance, 1 .

       o The  time of the original request, in Unix epoch time, in 8 hexadeci-
         mal digits. For example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in epoch time
         is 1480615200 seconds, or 58406520 in hexadecimal.

       o A 96-bit identifier for the trace, globally unique, in 24 hexadecimal
         digits.

       NOTE:
          Trace IDs created via OpenTelemetry have a different format based on
          the W3C Trace Context specification . A W3C trace ID must be format-
          ted in the X-Ray trace ID format when sending to X-Ray. For example,
          a  W3C trace ID 4efaaf4d1e8720b39541901950019ee5 should be formatted
          as 1-4efaaf4d-1e8720b39541901950019ee5 when sending to X-Ray.  While
          X-Ray trace IDs include the original request timestamp in Unix epoch
          time, this is not required or validated.

OPTIONS
       --trace-segment-documents (list)
          A string containing a JSON document defining one or more segments or
          subsegments.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To upload a segment

       The following put-trace-segments example uploads segment  documents  to
       AWS  X-Ray.  The segment document is consumed as a list of JSON segment
       documents.

          aws xray put-trace-segments \
              --trace-segment-documents "{\"id\":\"20312a0e2b8809f4\",\"name\":\"DynamoDB\",\"trace_id\":\"1-5832862d-a43aafded3334a971fe312db\",\"start_time\":1.479706157195E9,\"end_time\":1.479706157202E9,\"parent_id\":\"79736b962fe3239e\",\"http\":{\"response\":{\"content_length\":60,\"status\":200}},\"inferred\":true,\"aws\":{\"consistent_read\":false,\"table_name\":\"scorekeep-session-xray\",\"operation\":\"GetItem\",\"request_id\":\"SCAU23OM6M8FO38UASGC7785ARVV4KQNSO5AEMVJF66Q9ASUAAJG\",\"resource_names\":[\"scorekeep-session-xray\"]},\"origin\":\"AWS::DynamoDB::Table\"}"

       Output:

          {
              "UnprocessedTraceSegments": []
          }

       For more information, see Sending Trace Data to AWS X-Ray  in  the  AWS
       X-Ray Developer Guide.

              Information about a segment that failed processing.

              Id -> (string)
                 The segment's ID.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error that caused processing to fail.
