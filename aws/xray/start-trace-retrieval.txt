START-TRACE-RETRIEVAL()                                START-TRACE-RETRIEVAL()



NAME
       start-trace-retrieval -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates  a trace retrieval process using the specified time range and
       for the give trace IDs on Transaction Search generated  by  the  Cloud-
       Watch log group. For more information, see Transaction Search .

       API  returns  a  RetrievalToken , which can be used with ListRetrieved-
       Traces or GetRetrievedTracesGraph to  fetch  results.  Retrievals  will
       time  out  after 60 minutes. To execute long time ranges, consider seg-
       menting into multiple retrievals.

       If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability , you  can  use
       this  operation  in a monitoring account to retrieve data from a linked
       source account, as long as both accounts have  transaction  search  en-
       abled.

       For  retrieving  data  from  X-Ray  directly as opposed to the Transac-
       tion-Search Log group, see BatchGetTraces .

OPTIONS
       --trace-ids (list)
          Specify the trace IDs of the traces to be retrieved.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time range to retrieve traces. The range is  inclu-
          sive,  so  the specified start time is included in the query. Speci-
          fied as epoch time, the number of seconds  since  January  1,  1970,
          00:00:00 UTC.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  end  of  the time range to retrieve traces. The range is inclu-
          sive, so the specified end time is included in the query.  Specified
          as epoch time, the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00
          UTC.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RetrievalToken -> (string)
          Retrieval token.
