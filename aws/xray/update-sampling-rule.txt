OPTIONS
       --sampling-rule-update (structure)
          The rule and fields to change.

          RuleName -> (string)
              The  name of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either name or
              ARN, but not both.

          RuleARN -> (string)
              The ARN of the sampling rule. Specify a rule by either  name  or
              ARN, but not both.

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              Matches the ARN of the Amazon Web Services resource on which the
              service runs.

          Priority -> (integer)
              The priority of the sampling rule.

          FixedRate -> (double)
              The percentage of matching requests  to  instrument,  after  the
              reservoir is exhausted.

          ReservoirSize -> (integer)
              A  fixed  number  of matching requests to instrument per second,
              prior to applying the fixed rate. The reservoir is not used  di-
              rectly  by  services, but applies to all services using the rule
              collectively.

          Host -> (string)
              Matches the hostname from a request URL.

          ServiceName -> (string)
              Matches the name that the service uses  to  identify  itself  in
              segments.

          ServiceType -> (string)
              Matches the origin that the service uses to identify its type in
              segments.

          HTTPMethod -> (string)
              Matches the HTTP method of a request.

          URLPath -> (string)
              Matches the path from a request URL.

          Attributes -> (map)
              Matches attributes derived from the request.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RuleName=string,RuleARN=string,ResourceARN=string,Priority=integer,FixedRate=double,ReservoirSize=integer,Host=string,ServiceName=string,ServiceType=string,HTTPMethod=string,URLPath=string,Attributes={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RuleName": "string",
            "RuleARN": "string",
            "ResourceARN": "string",
            "Priority": integer,
            "FixedRate": double,
            "ReservoirSize": integer,
            "Host": "string",
            "ServiceName": "string",
            "ServiceType": "string",
            "HTTPMethod": "string",
            "URLPath": "string",
            "Attributes": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a sampling rule

       The  following  update-sampling-rule example modifies a sampling rule's
       configuration. The rules are consumed from a JSON file. Only the fields
       being updated are required.

          aws xray update-sampling-rule \
             --cli-input-json file://1000-default.json

       Contents of 1000-default.json:

          {
              "SamplingRuleUpdate": {
