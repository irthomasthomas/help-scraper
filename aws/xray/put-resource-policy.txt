OPTIONS
       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the resource policy. Must be unique  within  a  specific
          Amazon Web Services account.

       --policy-document (string)
          The resource policy document, which can be up to 5kb in size.

       --policy-revision-id (string)
          Specifies a specific policy revision, to ensure an atomic create op-
          eration. By default the resource policy is created if  it  does  not
          exist,  or  updated with an incremented revision id. The revision id
          is unique to each policy in the account.

          If the policy revision id does not match the latest revision id, the
          operation  will fail with an InvalidPolicyRevisionIdException excep-
          tion. You can also provide a PolicyRevisionId of 0.  In  this  case,
          the operation will fail with an InvalidPolicyRevisionIdException ex-
          ception if a resource policy with the same name already exists.

       --bypass-policy-lockout-check | --no-bypass-policy-lockout-check (bool-
       ean)
          A  flag  to  indicate  whether to bypass the resource policy lockout
          safety check.

          WARNING:
              Setting this value to true increases the risk  that  the  policy
              becomes  unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscrimi-
              nately.

          Use this parameter only when you include a policy in the request and
          you  intend to prevent the principal that is making the request from
          making a subsequent PutResourcePolicy request.

          The default value is false.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
