GET-RETRIEVED-TRACES-GRAPH()                      GET-RETRIEVED-TRACES-GRAPH()



NAME
       get-retrieved-traces-graph -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a service graph for traces based on the specified Retrieval-
       Token from the CloudWatch log group generated  by  Transaction  Search.
       This  API  does  not  initiate  a retrieval job. You must first execute
       StartTraceRetrieval to obtain the required RetrievalToken .

       The trace graph describes services that process incoming  requests  and
       any  downstream  services  they call, which may include Amazon Web Ser-
       vices resources, external APIs, or databases.

       The response is empty until the RetrievalStatus is COMPLETE . Retry the
       request  after the status changes from RUNNING or SCHEDULED to COMPLETE
       to access the full service graph.

       When CloudWatch log is the destination, this API can support  cross-ac-
       count observability and service graph retrieval across linked accounts.

       For  retrieving  graphs  from X-Ray directly as opposed to the Transac-
       tion-Search Log group, see GetTraceGraph .

OPTIONS
       --retrieval-token (string)
          Retrieval token.

       --next-token (string)
          Specify the pagination token returned by a previous request  to  re-
          trieve the next page of indexes.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
