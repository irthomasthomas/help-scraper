FINALIZE-DEVICE-CLAIM()                                FINALIZE-DEVICE-CLAIM()



NAME
       finalize-device-claim -

DESCRIPTION
       Given  a  device ID, finalizes the claim request for the associated de-
       vice.

       NOTE:
          Claiming a device consists of initiating a claim, then publishing  a
          device event, and finalizing the claim. For a device of type button,
          a device event can be published by simply clicking the device.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            finalize-device-claim
          --device-id <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --device-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the device.

       --tags (map)
          A collection of key/value pairs defining the resource tags. For  ex-
          ample,  {  "tags":  {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"} }. For more
          information, see AWS Tagging Strategies .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To finalize a claim request for an AWS IoT 1-Click device using  a  de-
       vice ID

       The  following  finalize-device-claim example finalizes a claim request
       for the specified AWS IoT 1-Click device using a device ID (instead  of
       a claim code).

          aws iot1click-devices finalize-device-claim \
              --device-id G030PM0123456789

       Output:

          {
              "State": "CLAIMED"
          }

       For more information, see Using AWS IoT 1-Click with the AWS CLI in the
       AWS IoT 1-Click Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       State -> (string)
          The device's final claim state.
