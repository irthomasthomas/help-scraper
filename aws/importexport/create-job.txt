CREATE-JOB()                                                      CREATE-JOB()



NAME
       create-job -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  initiates the process of scheduling an upload or down-
       load of your data. You include in the request a manifest that describes
       the data transfer specifics. The response to the request includes a job
       ID, which you can use in other operations, a signature that you use  to
       identify  your  storage  device,  and the address where you should ship
       your storage device.

OPTIONS
       --job-type (string) Specifies whether the job to initiate is an  import
       or export job.
          Possible values:

          o Import

          o Export

       --manifest (string) The UTF-8 encoded text of the manifest file.

       --manifest-addendum (string) For internal use only.

       --validate-only  |  --no-validate-only  (boolean) Validate the manifest
       and parameter values in the request but do not actually create a job.

       --api-version (string) Specifies the version of the client tool.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command creates an import job from a manifest file:

          aws importexport create-job --job-type import --manifest file://manifest --no-validate-only

       The  file  manifest is a YAML formatted text file in the current direc-
       tory with the following content:

          manifestVersion: 2.0;
          returnAddress:
          name: Jane Roe
          company: Example Corp.
          street1: 123 Any Street
          city: Anytown
          stateOrProvince: WA
          postalCode: 91011-1111
          phoneNumber: 206-555-1111
          country: USA
          deviceId: 49382
          eraseDevice: yes
          notificationEmail: john.doe@example.com;jane.roe@example.com
          bucket: myBucket

       For more information on the manifest file format, see  Creating  Import
       Manifests in the AWS Import/Export Developer Guide.

       You can also pass the manifest as a string in quotes:

          aws importexport create-job --job-type import --manifest 'manifestVersion: 2.0;
           returnAddress:
           name: Jane Roe
           company: Example Corp.
           street1: 123 Any Street
           city: Anytown
           stateOrProvince: WA
           postalCode: 91011-1111
           phoneNumber: 206-555-1111
           country: USA
           deviceId: 49382
           eraseDevice: yes
           notificationEmail: john.doe@example.com;jane.roe@example.com
           bucket: myBucket'

       Specifying Parameter Values in the AWS CLI User Guide.
