UPDATE-JOB()                                                      UPDATE-JOB()



NAME
       update-job -

DESCRIPTION
       You use this operation to change the parameters specified in the origi-
       nal manifest file by supplying a new manifest file. The  manifest  file
       attached  to  this request replaces the original manifest file. You can
       only use the operation after a CreateJob request but  before  the  data
       transfer starts and you can only use it on jobs you own.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-job
          --job-id <value>
          --manifest <value>
          --job-type <value>
          --validate-only | --no-validate-only
          [--api-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string) A unique identifier which refers to a particular job.

       --manifest (string) The UTF-8 encoded text of the manifest file.

       --job-type  (string) Specifies whether the job to initiate is an import
       or export job.
          Possible values:

          o Import

          o Export

       --validate-only | --no-validate-only (boolean)  Validate  the  manifest
       and parameter values in the request but do not actually create a job.

       --api-version (string) Specifies the version of the client tool.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command updates the specified job:

          aws importexport update-job --job-id EX1ID --job-type import --manifest file://manifest.txt --no-validate-only

       The output for the update-jobs command looks like the following:

          True    **** Device will be erased before being returned. ****

       With this command, you can either modify the original manifest you sub-
       mitted, or you can start over and create a new manifest file. In either
       case, the original manifest is discarded.

OUTPUT
       Success -> (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  (true)  or not (false) AWS Import/Export updated
          your job.

       WarningMessage -> (string)
          An optional message notifying you of non-fatal issues with the  job,
          such as use of an incompatible Amazon S3 bucket name.

       ArtifactList -> (list)
          A collection of artifacts.

          (structure)
              A  discrete item that contains the description and URL of an ar-
              tifact (such as a PDF).

              Description -> (string)
                 The associated description for this object.

              URL -> (string)
                 The URL for a given Artifact.
