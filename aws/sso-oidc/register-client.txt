NAME
       register-client -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  a  client  with  IAM Identity Center. This allows clients to
       initiate device authorization. The output should be persisted for reuse
       through many authentication requests.

OPTIONS
       --client-name (string)
          The friendly name of the client.

       --client-type (string)
          The  type  of  client.  The service supports only public as a client
          type. Anything other than public will be rejected by the service.

       --scopes (list)
          The list of scopes that are defined by the client.  Upon  authoriza-
          tion, this list is used to restrict permissions when granting an ac-
          cess token.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --redirect-uris (list)
          The list of redirect URI that are defined by the client. At  comple-
          tion  of authorization, this list is used to restrict what locations
          the user agent can be redirected back to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --grant-types (list)
          The list of OAuth 2.0 grant types that are defined  by  the  client.
          This  list is used to restrict the token granting flows available to
          the client.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --issuer-url (string)
          The IAM Identity Center Issuer URL associated with  an  instance  of
          IAM  Identity  Center.  This  value is needed for user access to re-
          sources through the client.

       --entitled-application-arn (string)
          This IAM Identity Center application ARN is used to define  adminis-
          trator-managed  configuration for public client access to resources.
          At authorization, the scopes, grants, and redirect URI available  to
          this client will be restricted by this application resource.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       clientId -> (string)
          The  unique identifier string for each client. This client uses this
          identifier to get authenticated by the service in subsequent calls.

       clientSecret -> (string)
          A secret string generated for the client. The client will  use  this
          string to get authenticated by the service in subsequent calls.

       clientIdIssuedAt -> (long)
          Indicates  the  time at which the clientId and clientSecret were is-
          sued.

       clientSecretExpiresAt -> (long)
          Indicates the time at which the clientId and clientSecret  will  be-
          come invalid.

       authorizationEndpoint -> (string)
          An endpoint that the client can use to request authorization.

       tokenEndpoint -> (string)
