CREATE-TOKEN-WITH-IAM()                                CREATE-TOKEN-WITH-IAM()



NAME
       create-token-with-iam -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  and returns access and refresh tokens for clients and applica-
       tions that are authenticated using IAM entities. The access  token  can
       be  used  to  fetch  short-term credentials for the assigned Amazon Web
       Services accounts or to access application APIs using bearer  authenti-
       cation.

OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  string  for the client or application. This
          value is an application ARN that has OAuth grants configured.

       --grant-type (string)
          Supports the following OAuth grant types:  Authorization  Code,  Re-
          fresh Token, JWT Bearer, and Token Exchange. Specify one of the fol-
          lowing values, depending on the grant type that you want:

          o Authorization Code - authorization_code

          o Refresh Token - refresh_token

          o JWT Bearer - urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer

          o Token Exchange - urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange

       --code (string)
          Used only when calling this API for  the  Authorization  Code  grant
          type.  This  short-term  code is used to identify this authorization
          request. The code is obtained through a redirect from  IAM  Identity
          Center  to  a  redirect  URI  persisted  in  the  Authorization Code
          GrantOptions for the application.

       --refresh-token (string)
          Used only when calling this API for the Refresh  Token  grant  type.
          This  token is used to refresh short-term tokens, such as the access
          token, that might expire.

          For more information about the features and limitations of the  cur-
          rent IAM Identity Center OIDC implementation, see Considerations for
          Using this Guide in the IAM Identity Center OIDC API Reference .

       --assertion (string)
          Used only when calling this API for the JWT Bearer grant type.  This
          value  specifies  the JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by a trusted token
          issuer. To authorize a  trusted  token  issuer,  configure  the  JWT
          Bearer GrantOptions for the application.

       --scope (list)
          The  list of scopes for which authorization is requested. The access
          token that is issued is limited to the scopes that are  granted.  If
          the  value  is  not  specified,  IAM  Identity Center authorizes all
          scopes configured for the application, including the  following  de-
          fault scopes: openid , aws , sts:identity_context .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --redirect-uri (string)
          Used  only  when  calling  this API for the Authorization Code grant
          type. This value specifies the location of the client or application
          that has registered to receive the authorization code.

       --subject-token (string)
          Used  only  when calling this API for the Token Exchange grant type.
          This value specifies the subject of the exchange. The value  of  the
          subject  token must be an access token issued by IAM Identity Center
          to a different client or application. The access token must have au-
          thorized  scopes that indicate the requested application as a target
          audience.

       --subject-token-type (string)
          Used only when calling this API for the Token Exchange  grant  type.
          This value specifies the type of token that is passed as the subject
          of the exchange. The following value is supported:

          o Access Token - urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token

       --requested-token-type (string)
          Used only when calling this API for the Token Exchange  grant  type.
          This  value  specifies  the type of token that the requester can re-
          ceive. The following values are supported:

          o Access Token - urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token

          o Refresh Token - urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token

       --code-verifier (string)
          Used only when calling this API for  the  Authorization  Code  grant
          type.  This  value is generated by the client and presented to vali-
          date the original code challenge value the client passed  at  autho-
          rization time.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
