       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-device-authorization
          --client-id <value>
          --client-secret <value>
          --start-url <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The unique identifier string for the client that is registered  with
          Amazon  Web  Services SSO. This value should come from the persisted
          result of the  RegisterClient API operation.

       --client-secret (string)
          A secret string that is generated for the client. This value  should
          come from the persisted result of the  RegisterClient API operation.

       --start-url (string)
          The  URL  for the AWS access portal. For more information, see Using
          the AWS access portal in the Amazon Web Services SSO User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       deviceCode -> (string)
          The  short-lived  code that is used by the device when polling for a
          session token.

       userCode -> (string)
          A one-time user verification code. This is needed  to  authorize  an
          in-use device.

       verificationUri -> (string)
          The  URI  of the verification page that takes the userCode to autho-
          rize the device.

       verificationUriComplete -> (string)
          An alternate URL that the client can use to automatically  launch  a
          browser. This process skips the manual step in which the user visits
          the verification page and enters their code.

       expiresIn -> (integer)
          Indicates the number of seconds in which the verification code  will
          become invalid.

       interval -> (integer)
          Indicates  the  number  of  seconds the client must wait between at-
          tempts when polling for a session.
