OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The unique identifier string for the client that is registered  with
          IAM  Identity  Center. This value should come from the persisted re-
          sult of the  RegisterClient API operation.

       --client-secret (string)
          A secret string that is generated for the client. This value  should
          come from the persisted result of the  RegisterClient API operation.

       --start-url (string)
          The  URL  for the AWS access portal. For more information, see Using
          the AWS access portal in the IAM Identity Center User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       deviceCode -> (string)
          The  short-lived  code that is used by the device when polling for a
          session token.

       userCode -> (string)
          A one-time user verification code. This is needed  to  authorize  an
          in-use device.

       verificationUri -> (string)
          The  URI  of the verification page that takes the userCode to autho-
          rize the device.

       verificationUriComplete -> (string)
          An alternate URL that the client can use to automatically  launch  a
          browser. This process skips the manual step in which the user visits
          the verification page and enters their code.

       expiresIn -> (integer)
          Indicates the number of seconds in which the verification code  will
          become invalid.

       interval -> (integer)
          Indicates  the  number  of  seconds the client must wait between at-
          tempts when polling for a session.
