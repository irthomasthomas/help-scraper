NAME
       sso-admin -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) helps you se-
       curely create, or connect, your workforce identities and  manage  their
       access  centrally  across  AWS  accounts and applications. IAM Identity
       Center is the recommended approach for workforce authentication and au-
       thorization in AWS, for organizations of any size and type.

       NOTE:
          Although  AWS  Single Sign-On was renamed, the sso and identitystore
          API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for back-
          ward  compatibility purposes. For more information, see IAM Identity
          Center rename .

       This reference guide provides information on single sign-on  operations
       which could be used for access management of AWS accounts. For informa-
       tion about IAM Identity Center features, see the  IAM  Identity  Center
       User Guide .

       Many operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for
       users and groups, known as principals. For more information  about  how
       to  work  with principals and principal IDs in IAM Identity Center, see
       the Identity Store API Reference .

       NOTE:
          AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for var-
          ious programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, An-
          droid, and more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to  create  pro-
          grammatic  access to IAM Identity Center and other AWS services. For
          more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to  download  and
          install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services .
