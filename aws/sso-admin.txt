NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web  Services Single Sign On helps you securely create, or con-
       nect, your workforce  identities  and  manage  their  access  centrally
       across  Amazon  Web Services accounts and applications. Amazon Web Ser-
       vices SSO is the recommended approach for workforce authentication  and
       authorization in Amazon Web Services, for organizations of any size and
       type.

       NOTE:
          Although Amazon Web Services Single Sign-On was renamed, the sso and
          identitystore  API namespaces will continue to retain their original
          name for backward compatibility purposes. For more information,  see
          Amazon Web Services SSO rename .

       This  reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations
       which could be used for access management of Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
       counts. For information about Amazon Web Services SSO features, see the
       Amazon Web Services SSO User Guide .

       Many operations in the Amazon Web Services SSO APIs rely on identifiers
       for  users  and groups, known as principals. For more information about
       how to work with principals and principal IDs in  Amazon  Web  Services
       SSO, see the Identity Store API Reference .

       NOTE:
          Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sam-
          ple code for various  programming  languages  and  platforms  (Java,
          Ruby,  .Net,  iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs provide a convenient
          way to create programmatic access to Amazon  Web  Services  SSO  and
          other  Amazon  Web Services services. For more information about the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, including  how  to  download  and  install
          them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services .
