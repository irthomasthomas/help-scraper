NAME
       cancel-environment-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Attempts  to  cancel an environment deployment on an  UpdateEnvironment
       action, if the deployment is IN_PROGRESS . For  more  information,  see
       Update an environment in the Proton Administrator guide .

       The following list includes potential cancellation scenarios.

       o If  the cancellation attempt succeeds, the resulting deployment state
         is CANCELLED .

       o If the cancellation attempt fails, the resulting deployment state  is
         FAILED .

       o If  the current  UpdateEnvironment action succeeds before the cancel-
         lation attempt starts, the resulting deployment  state  is  SUCCEEDED
         and the cancellation attempt has no effect.

OPTIONS
       --environment-name (string)
          The name of the environment with the deployment to cancel.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
