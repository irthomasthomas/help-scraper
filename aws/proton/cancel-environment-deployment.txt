NAME
       cancel-environment-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Attempts  to  cancel an environment deployment on an  UpdateEnvironment
       action, if the deployment is IN_PROGRESS . For  more  information,  see
       Update an environment in the Proton Administrator guide .

       The following list includes potential cancellation scenarios.

       o If  the cancellation attempt succeeds, the resulting deployment state
         is CANCELLED .

       o If the cancellation attempt fails, the resulting deployment state  is
         FAILED .

       o If  the current  UpdateEnvironment action succeeds before the cancel-
         lation attempt starts, the resulting deployment  state  is  SUCCEEDED
         and the cancellation attempt has no effect.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-environment-deployment
          --environment-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --environment-name (string)
          The name of the environment with the deployment to cancel.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              defined components to be associated with the environment.
