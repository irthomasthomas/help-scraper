LIST-COMPONENTS()                                            LIST-COMPONENTS()



NAME
       list-components -

DESCRIPTION
       List  components  with  summary data. You can filter the result list by
       environment, service, or a single service instance.

       For more information about components, see  Proton  components  in  the
       Proton Administrator Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-components is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: components

SYNOPSIS
            list-components
          [--environment-name <value>]
          [--service-instance-name <value>]
          [--service-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --environment-name (string)
          The name of an environment for result list filtering. Proton returns
          components  associated  with  the environment or attached to service
          instances running in it.

       --service-instance-name (string)
          The name of a service instance for result list filtering. Proton re-
          turns the component attached to the service instance, if any.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of a service for result list filtering. Proton returns com-
          ponents attached to service instances of the service.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 instance.

              serviceName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the service that serviceInstanceName is associ-
                 ated with. Provided when a component is attached to a service
                 instance.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates the location of the next component in the ar-
          ray of components, after the current requested list of components.
