UPDATE-SERVICE-INSTANCE()                            UPDATE-SERVICE-INSTANCE()



NAME
       update-service-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Update a service instance.

       There  are a few modes for updating a service instance. The deployment-
       Type field defines the mode.

       NOTE:
          You can't update a service instance while its deployment status,  or
          the  deployment status of a component attached to it, is IN_PROGRESS
          .

          For more information about components, see Proton components in  the
          Proton User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          The client token of the service instance to update.

       --deployment-type (string)
          The  deployment type. It defines the mode for updating a service in-
          stance, as follows:
              NONE

          In this mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the  requested  meta-
          data parameters are updated.
              CURRENT_VERSION

          In  this mode, the service instance is deployed and updated with the
          new spec that you provide. Only requested  parameters  are  updated.
          Dont include major or minor version parameters when you use this de-
          ployment type.
              MINOR_VERSION

          In this mode, the service instance is deployed and updated with  the
          published,  recommended  (latest) minor version of the current major
          version in use, by default. You can also specify a  different  minor
          version of the current major version in use.
              MAJOR_VERSION

          In  this mode, the service instance is deployed and updated with the
          published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the  cur-
          rent template, by default. You can specify a different major version
          that's higher than the major version in use and a minor version.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o CURRENT_VERSION

          o MINOR_VERSION

          o MAJOR_VERSION

       --name (string)
          The name of the service instance to update.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service that the service instance belongs to.

       --spec (string)
          The formatted specification that defines the  service  instance  up-
          date.

       --template-major-version (string)
          The major version of the service template to update.

       --template-minor-version (string)
          The minor version of the service template to update.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a service instance to a new minor version

       The following update-service-instance example  updates  a  service  in-
       stance  to  a new minor version of its service template that adds a new
       instance named "my-other-instance" with a new required input.

          aws proton update-service-instance \
              --service-name "simple-svc" \
              --spec "file://service-spec.yaml " \
              --template-major-version "1" \
              --template-minor-version "1" \
              --deployment-type "MINOR_VERSION" \
              --name "instance-one"

       Contents of service-spec.yaml:

          proton: ServiceSpec
          pipeline:
              my_sample_pipeline_optional_input: "abc"
              my_sample_pipeline_required_input: "123"
          instances:
              - name: "instance-one"
                  environment: "simple-env"
                  spec:
                      my_sample_service_instance_optional_input: "def"
                      my_sample_service_instance_required_input: "456"
              - name: "my-other-instance"
                  environment: "simple-env"
                  spec:
                      my_sample_service_instance_required_input: "789"

       Output:

          {
              "serviceInstance": {
