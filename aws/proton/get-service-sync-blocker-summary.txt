OPTIONS
       --service-instance-name (string)
          The  name  of  the service instance that you want to get the service
          sync blocker summary for. If given bothe the instance name  and  the
          service name, only the instance is blocked.

       --service-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  service  that  you  want to get the service sync
          blocker summary for. If given only the service name,  all  instances
          are blocked.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID of the sync blocker.

                 resolvedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The time the sync blocker was resolved.

                 resolvedReason -> (string)
                     The reason the sync blocker was resolved.

                 status -> (string)
                     The status of the sync blocker.

                 type -> (string)

          serviceInstanceName -> (string)
              The name of the service instance that you want sync your service

          serviceName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the service that you want to get the sync blocker
              summary for. If given a service  instance  name  and  a  service

              If given only a service name, it will return the  blockers  that
              apply  to all of the instances. In order to get the blockers for
              a single instance, you will need to make two distinct calls, one
              to get the sync blocker summary for the service and the other to
              get the sync blocker for the service instance.
