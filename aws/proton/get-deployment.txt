OPTIONS
       --component-name (string)
          The name of a component that you want to get the detailed data for.

       --environment-name (string)
          The  name  of  a  environment that you want to get the detailed data
          for.

       --id (string)
          The ID of the deployment that you want to get the detailed data for.

       --service-instance-name (string)
          The name of the service instance associated with the  given  deploy-
          ment  ID.  serviceName must be specified to identify the service in-
          stance.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service associated with the given deployment ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
