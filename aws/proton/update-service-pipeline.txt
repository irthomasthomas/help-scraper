NAME
       update-service-pipeline -

DESCRIPTION
       Update the service pipeline.

       There  are  four modes for updating a service pipeline. The deployment-
       Type field defines the mode.
          NONE

       In this mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the  requested  metadata
       parameters are updated.
          CURRENT_VERSION

       In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the new
       spec that you provide. Only requested parameters are updated. Dont  in-
       clude  major  or  minor  version  parameters  when you use this deploy-
       ment-type .
          MINOR_VERSION

       In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed  and  updated  with  the
       published, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major ver-
       sion in use, by default. You can specify a different minor  version  of
       the current major version in use.
          MAJOR_VERSION

       In  this  mode,  the  service pipeline is deployed and updated with the
       published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the  current
       template  by  default. You can specify a different major version that's
       higher than the major version in use and a minor version.

OPTIONS
       --deployment-type (string)
          The deployment type.

          There are four modes for updating a service  pipeline.  The  deploy-
          mentType field defines the mode.
              NONE

          In  this  mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the requested meta-
          data parameters are updated.
              CURRENT_VERSION

          In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with  the
          new  spec  that  you provide. Only requested parameters are updated.
          Dont include major or minor version parameters when you use this de-
          ployment-type .
              MINOR_VERSION

          In  this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the
          published, recommended (latest) minor version of the  current  major
          version  in  use, by default. You can specify a different minor ver-
          sion of the current major version in use.
              MAJOR_VERSION

          In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with  the
          published,  recommended (latest) major and minor version of the cur-
          rent template, by default. You can specify a different major version
          that's higher than the major version in use and a minor version.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o CURRENT_VERSION

          o MINOR_VERSION

          o MAJOR_VERSION

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service to that the pipeline is associated with.

       --spec (string)
          The spec for the service pipeline to update.

       --template-major-version (string)
          The  major  version  of the service template that was used to create
          the service that the pipeline is associated with.

       --template-minor-version (string)
          The minor version of the service template that was  used  to  create
          the service that the pipeline is associated with.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a service pipeline

       The  following  update-service-pipeline example updates a service pipe-
       line to a new minor version of its service template.

          aws proton update-service-pipeline \
              --service-name "simple-svc" \
              --spec "file://service-spec.yaml" \
              --template-major-version "1" \
              --template-minor-version "1" \
              --deployment-type "MINOR_VERSION"

       Output:
