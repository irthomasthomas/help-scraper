SYNOPSIS
            update-account-settings
          [--pipeline-provisioning-repository <value>]
          [--pipeline-service-role-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-provisioning-repository (structure)
          A repository for pipeline provisioning. Specify it if you have envi-
          ronments configured for self-managed provisioning with services that
          include pipelines.

          branch -> (string)
              The repository branch.

          name -> (string)
              The repository name.

          provider -> (string)
              The repository provider.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          branch=string,name=string,provider=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "branch": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "provider": "GITHUB"|"GITHUB_ENTERPRISE"|"BITBUCKET"
          }

       --pipeline-service-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the service role you want to use
          for provisioning pipelines. Assumed by Proton for  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices-managed  provisioning,  and  by  customer-owned automation for
          self-managed provisioning.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       accountSettings -> (structure)
          The  Proton  pipeline service role and repository data shared across
          the Amazon Web Services account.

          pipelineProvisioningRepository -> (structure)
              The repository configured in the Amazon Web Services account for
              pipeline provisioning. Required it if you have environments con-
              figured for self-managed provisioning with services that include
              pipelines.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the repository branch.

              branch -> (string)
                 The repository branch.

              name -> (string)
                 The repository name.

          pipelineServiceRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the service role you want to
              use for provisioning pipelines. Assumed by Proton for Amazon Web
              Services-managed  provisioning, and by customer-owned automation
              for self-managed provisioning.
