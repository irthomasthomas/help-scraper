OPTIONS
       --delete-pipeline-provisioning-repository | --no-delete-pipeline-provi-
       sioning-repository (boolean)
          Set  to true to remove a configured pipeline repository from the ac-
          count settings. Don't set this field if you are updating the config-
          ured pipeline repository.

       --pipeline-provisioning-repository (structure)
          A  linked  repository  for  pipeline provisioning. Specify it if you
          have environments configured for self-managed provisioning with ser-
          vices  that  include  pipelines. A linked repository is a repository
          that has been registered with  Proton.  For  more  information,  see
          CreateRepository .

          To remove a previously configured repository, set deletePipelinePro-
          visioningRepository to  true  ,  and  don't  set  pipelineProvision-
          ingRepository .

          branch -> (string)
              The repository branch.

          name -> (string)
              The repository name.

          provider -> (string)
              The repository provider.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          branch=string,name=string,provider=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "branch": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "provider": "GITHUB"|"GITHUB_ENTERPRISE"|"BITBUCKET"
          }

       --pipeline-service-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the service role you want to use
          for provisioning pipelines. Assumed by Proton for  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices-managed  provisioning,  and  by  customer-owned automation for
          self-managed provisioning.

          To remove a previously configured ARN, specify an empty string.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
