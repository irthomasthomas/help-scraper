UPDATE-ENVIRONMENT()                                      UPDATE-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       update-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Update an environment.

       If  the  environment  is associated with an environment account connec-
       tion, don't update or include the protonServiceRoleArn  and  provision-
       ingRepository  parameter to update or connect to an environment account
       connection.

       You can only update to a new environment  account  connection  if  that
       connection was created in the same environment account that the current
       environment account connection was created in. The  account  connection
       must also be associated with the current environment.

       If the environment isn't associated with an environment account connec-
       tion, don't update or include the environmentAccountConnectionId param-
       eter. You can't update or connect the environment to an environment ac-
       count connection if it isn't already  associated  with  an  environment
       connection.

       You  can update either the environmentAccountConnectionId or protonSer-
       viceRoleArn parameter and value. You cant update both.

       If the environment was configured for Amazon Web Services-managed  pro-
       visioning, omit the provisioningRepository parameter.

       If  the environment was configured for self-managed provisioning, spec-
       ify  the  provisioningRepository  parameter  and  omit  the  protonSer-
       viceRoleArn and environmentAccountConnectionId parameters.

       For  more information, see Environments and Provisioning methods in the
       Proton Administrator Guide .

       There are four modes for updating an  environment.  The  deploymentType
       field defines the mode.
          NONE

       In  this  mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the requested metadata
       parameters are updated.
          CURRENT_VERSION

       In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the new spec
       that  you  provide. Only requested parameters are updated. Dont include
       minor or major version parameters when you use this deployment-type .
          MINOR_VERSION

       In this mode, the environment is deployed and  updated  with  the  pub-
       lished, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major version
       in use, by default. You can also specify a different minor  version  of
       the current major version in use.
          MAJOR_VERSION

       In  this  mode,  the  environment is deployed and updated with the pub-
       lished, recommended (latest) major and minor  version  of  the  current
       template,  by  default.  You can also specify a different major version
       that's higher than the major version in use and a minor version.

OPTIONS
       --component-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role  that  Proton
          uses  when provisioning directly defined components in this environ-
          ment. It determines the scope of infrastructure that a component can
          provision.

          The  environment  must have a componentRoleArn to allow directly de-
          fined components to be associated with the environment.

          For more information about components, see Proton components in  the
          Proton Administrator Guide .

       --deployment-type (string)
          There are four modes for updating an environment. The deploymentType
          field defines the mode.
              NONE

          In this mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the  requested  meta-
          data parameters are updated.
              CURRENT_VERSION

          In  this  mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the new
          spec that you provide. Only requested parameters are  updated.  Dont
          include  major or minor version parameters when you use this deploy-
          ment-type .
              MINOR_VERSION

          In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the  pub-
          lished, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major ver-
          sion in use, by default. You can also specify a different minor ver-
          sion of the current major version in use.
              MAJOR_VERSION

          In  this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the pub-
          lished, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the  current
          template, by default. You can also specify a different major version
          that is higher than the major version in use  and  a  minor  version
          (optional).

          was created in the same environment account that the  current  envi-
          ronment account connection was created in and is associated with the
          current environment.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
