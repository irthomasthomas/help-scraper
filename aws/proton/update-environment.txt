UPDATE-ENVIRONMENT()                                      UPDATE-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       update-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Update an environment.

       If  the  environment  is associated with an environment account connec-
       tion, don't update or include the protonServiceRoleArn  and  provision-
       ingRepository  parameter to update or connect to an environment account
       connection.

       You can only update to a new environment  account  connection  if  that
       connection was created in the same environment account that the current
       environment account connection was created in. The  account  connection
       must also be associated with the current environment.

       If the environment isn't associated with an environment account connec-
       tion, don't update or include the environmentAccountConnectionId param-
       eter. You can't update or connect the environment to an environment ac-
       count connection if it isn't already  associated  with  an  environment
       connection.

       You  can update either the environmentAccountConnectionId or protonSer-
       viceRoleArn parameter and value. You cant update both.

       If the environment was configured for Amazon Web Services-managed  pro-
       visioning, omit the provisioningRepository parameter.

       If  the environment was configured for self-managed provisioning, spec-
       ify  the  provisioningRepository  parameter  and  omit  the  protonSer-
       viceRoleArn and environmentAccountConnectionId parameters.

       For  more information, see Environments and Provisioning methods in the
       Proton User Guide .

       There are four modes for updating an  environment.  The  deploymentType
       field defines the mode.
          NONE

       In  this  mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the requested metadata
       parameters are updated.
          CURRENT_VERSION

       In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the new spec
       that  you  provide. Only requested parameters are updated. Dont include
       minor or major version parameters when you use this deployment-type .
          MINOR_VERSION

       In this mode, the environment is deployed and  updated  with  the  pub-
       lished, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major version
       in use, by default. You can also specify a different minor  version  of
       the current major version in use.
          MAJOR_VERSION

       In  this  mode,  the  environment is deployed and updated with the pub-
       lished, recommended (latest) major and minor  version  of  the  current
       template,  by  default.  You can also specify a different major version
       that's higher than the major version in use and a minor version.

OPTIONS
       --codebuild-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role  that  allows

          ing on your behalf.

       --component-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role  that  Proton
          uses  when provisioning directly defined components in this environ-
          ment. It determines the scope of infrastructure that a component can
          provision.

          The  environment  must have a componentRoleArn to allow directly de-
          fined components to be associated with the environment.

          For more information about components, see Proton components in  the
          Proton User Guide .

          There are four modes for updating an environment. The deploymentType
          field defines the mode.

          data parameters are updated.

          In  this  mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the new
          spec that you provide. Only requested parameters are  updated.  Dont
          include  major or minor version parameters when you use this deploy-
          ment-type .
              MINOR_VERSION

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
