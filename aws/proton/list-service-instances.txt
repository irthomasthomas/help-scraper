LIST-SERVICE-INSTANCES()                              LIST-SERVICE-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-service-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       List service instances with summary data. This action lists service in-
       stances of all services in the Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-service-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: serviceInstances

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An  array  of filtering criteria that scope down the result list. By
          default, all service instances in the Amazon  Web  Services  account
          are returned.

          (structure)
              A  filtering  criterion  to  scope  down  the result list of the
              ListServiceInstances action.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of a filtering criterion.

              value -> (string)
                 A value to filter by.

                 With the date/time keys (*At{Before,After} ), the value is  a
                 valid RFC 3339 string with no UTC offset and with an optional
                 fractional precision (for example, 1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z ).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "name"|"deploymentStatus"|"templateName"|"serviceName"|"deployedTemplateVersionStatus"|"environmentName"|"lastDeploymentAttemptedAtBefore"|"lastDeploymentAttemptedAtAfter"|"createdAtBefore"|"createdAtAfter",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service that the service instance belongs to.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field that the result list is sorted by.

          When you choose to sort by serviceName ,  service  instances  within
          each service are sorted by service instance name.

          Default: serviceName

          Possible values:

          o name

          o deploymentStatus

          o templateName

          o serviceName

          o environmentName

          o lastDeploymentAttemptedAt

          o createdAt

       --sort-order (string)
          Result list sort order.

          Default: ASCENDING

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list all service instances

       The following list-service-instances example lists service instances.

          aws proton list-service-instances

       Output:

          {
              "serviceInstances": [
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:service/simple-svc/service-instance/instance-one",
