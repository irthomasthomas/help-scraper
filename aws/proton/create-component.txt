OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          An optional customer-provided description of the component.

       --environment-name (string)
          The  name  of the Proton environment that you want to associate this
          component with. You must specify this when you don't specify  servi-
          ceInstanceName and serviceName .

       --manifest (string)
          A  path  to  a  manifest  file that lists the Infrastructure as Code
          (IaC) file, template language, and rendering engine for  infrastruc-
          ture that a custom component provisions.

       --name (string)
          The customer-provided name of the component.

       --service-instance-name (string)
          The name of the service instance that you want to attach this compo-
          nent to. If you don't specify this, the component isn't attached  to
          any  service instance. Specify both serviceInstanceName and service-
          Name or neither of them.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service that serviceInstanceName is associated with.
          If  you don't specify this, the component isn't attached to any ser-
          vice instance. Specify both serviceInstanceName and  serviceName  or
          neither of them.

       --service-spec (string)
          The  service  spec that you want the component to use to access ser-
          vice inputs. Set this only when you attach the component to  a  ser-
          vice instance.

       --tags (list)
          An  optional  list of metadata items that you can associate with the
          Proton component. A tag is a key-value pair.

          For more information, see Proton resources and tagging in the Proton
          Administrator Guide or Proton User Guide .

          (structure)
              A description of a resource tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the resource tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --template-file (string)
          A  path  to  the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) file describing infra-
          structure that a custom component provisions.

          NOTE:
              Components support a single IaC file, even if you use  Terraform
              as your template language.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          serviceSpec -> (string)
              The service spec that the component uses to access  service  in-
