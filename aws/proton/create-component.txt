OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          The client token for the created component.

       --description (string)
          An optional customer-provided description of the component.

       --environment-name (string)
          The  name  of the Proton environment that you want to associate this
          component with. You must specify this when you don't specify  servi-
          ceInstanceName and serviceName .

       --manifest (string)
          A  path  to  a  manifest  file that lists the Infrastructure as Code
          (IaC) file, template language, and rendering engine for  infrastruc-
          ture that a custom component provisions.

       --name (string)
          The customer-provided name of the component.

       --service-instance-name (string)
          The name of the service instance that you want to attach this compo-
          nent to. If you don't specify this, the component isn't attached  to
          any  service instance. Specify both serviceInstanceName and service-
          Name or neither of them.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service that serviceInstanceName is associated with.
          If  you don't specify this, the component isn't attached to any ser-
          vice instance. Specify both serviceInstanceName and  serviceName  or
          neither of them.

       --service-spec (string)
          The  service  spec that you want the component to use to access ser-
          vice inputs. Set this only when you attach the component to  a  ser-
          vice instance.

       --tags (list)
          An  optional  list of metadata items that you can associate with the
          Proton component. A tag is a key-value pair.

          For more information, see Proton resources and tagging in the Proton
          User Guide .

          (structure)
              A description of a resource tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the resource tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --template-file (string)
          A  path  to  the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) file describing infra-
          structure that a custom component provisions.

          NOTE:
              Components support a single IaC file, even if you use  Terraform
              as your template language.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
