OPTIONS
       --branch-name (string)
          The  name  of  the code repository branch that holds the code that's
          deployed in Proton. Don't include this  parameter  if  your  service
          template doesn't include a service pipeline.

       --description (string)
          A description of the Proton service.

       --name (string)
          The service name.

       --repository-connection-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the repository connection. For
          more information, see Setting up an AWS CodeStar connection  in  the
          Proton  User  Guide  .  Don't include this parameter if your service
          template doesn't include a service pipeline.

       --repository-id (string)
          The ID of the code repository. Don't include this parameter if  your
          service template doesn't include a service pipeline.

       --spec (string)
          A link to a spec file that provides inputs as defined in the service
          template bundle schema file. The spec file is in YAML  format.  Dont
          include  pipeline inputs in the spec if your service template doesnt
          include a service pipeline. For more information, see Create a  ser-
          vice in the Proton User Guide .

       --tags (list)
          An  optional  list of metadata items that you can associate with the
          Proton service. A tag is a key-value pair.

          User Guide .

          (structure)
              A description of a resource tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the resource tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --template-major-version (string)
          The  major  version  of the service template that was used to create
          the service.

       --template-minor-version (string)
          The minor version of the service template that was  used  to  create
          the service.

       --template-name (string)
          The name of the service template that's used to create the service.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a service

       The following create-service example creates a service with  a  service
       pipeline.

          aws proton create-service \
              --name "MySimpleService" \
              --template-name "fargate-service" \
              --template-major-version "1" \
              --branch-name "mainline" \
              --repository-connection-arn "arn:aws:codestar-connections:region-id:account-id:connection/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" \
              --repository-id "myorg/myapp" \
              --spec file://spec.yaml

       Contents of spec.yaml:

          proton: ServiceSpec

          pipeline:
