NAME
       get-resources-summary -

DESCRIPTION
       Get counts of Proton resources.

       For infrastructure-provisioning resources (environments, services, ser-
       vice instances, pipelines), the action returns staleness counts. A  re-
       source  is stale when it's behind the recommended version of the Proton
       template that it uses and it needs an update to become current.

       The action returns staleness  counts  (counts  of  resources  that  are
       up-to-date, behind a template major version, or behind a template minor
       version), the total number of resources, and the  number  of  resources
       that are in a failed state, grouped by resource type. Components, envi-
       ronments, and service templates are exceptionssee the components ,  en-
       vironments , and serviceTemplates field descriptions.

       For  context,  the action also returns the total number of each type of
       Proton template in the Amazon Web Services account.

       For more information, see Proton dashboard in the Proton User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       counts -> (structure)
          Summary counts of each Proton resource type.

          components -> (structure)
              The  total  number  of components in the Amazon Web Services ac-
              count.

              The semantics of the components field are different from the se-
              mantics  of  results  for  other infrastructure-provisioning re-
              sources. That's because at this time components don't have asso-
              ciated templates, therefore they don't have the concept of stal-
              eness. The components object will only contain total and  failed
              members.
