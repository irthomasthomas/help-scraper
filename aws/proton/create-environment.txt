CREATE-ENVIRONMENT()                                      CREATE-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       create-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Deploy  a new environment. An Proton environment is created from an en-
       vironment template that defines infrastructure and resources  that  can
       be shared across services.
          You can provision environments using the following methods:

       o Amazon  Web  Services-managed provisioning: Proton makes direct calls
         to provision your resources.

       o Self-managed provisioning: Proton makes pull requests on your reposi-
         tory to provide compiled infrastructure as code (IaC) files that your
         IaC engine uses to provision resources.

       For more information, see Environments and Provisioning methods in  the
       Proton User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --codebuild-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role that allows
          Proton to provision infrastructure using CodeBuild-based  provision-
          ing on your behalf.

          To  use  CodeBuild-based provisioning for the environment or for any
          service instance running in the environment, specify either the  en-
          vironmentAccountConnectionId or codebuildRoleArn parameter.

       --component-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role that Proton
          uses when provisioning directly defined components in this  environ-
          ment. It determines the scope of infrastructure that a component can
          provision.

          You must specify componentRoleArn to allow directly  defined  compo-
          nents to be associated with this environment.

          For  more information about components, see Proton components in the
          Proton User Guide .

          you're  provisioning your environment infrastructure resources to an
          environment account. For more information, see  Environment  account
          connections in the Proton User guide .

          To use Amazon Web Services-managed provisioning for the environment,

          To use Amazon Web Services-managed provisioning for the environment,
          specify  either  the  environmentAccountConnectionId  or  protonSer-
          viceRoleArn parameter and omit the provisioningRepository parameter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-

       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
