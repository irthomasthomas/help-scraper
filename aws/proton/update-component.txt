NAME
       update-component -

DESCRIPTION
       Update a component.

       There  are  a  few  modes  for updating a component. The deploymentType
       field defines the mode.

       NOTE:
          You can't update a component while its deployment status, or the de-
          ployment status of a service instance attached to it, is IN_PROGRESS
          .

       For more information about components, see  Proton  components  in  the
       Proton User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          The client token for the updated component.

       --deployment-type (string)
          The  deployment  type. It defines the mode for updating a component,
          as follows:
              NONE

          In this mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the  requested  meta-
          data  parameters  are  updated.  You can only specify description in
          this mode.
              CURRENT_VERSION

          In this mode, the component is deployed and  updated  with  the  new
          serviceSpec  ,  templateSource  , and/or type that you provide. Only
          requested parameters are updated.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o CURRENT_VERSION

       --description (string)
          An optional customer-provided description of the component.

       --name (string)
          The name of the component to update.

       --service-instance-name (string)
          The name of the service instance that you want to attach this compo-
          nent  to.  Don't specify to keep the component's current service in-
          stance attachment. Specify an empty string to detach  the  component
          from the service instance it's attached to. Specify non-empty values
          for both serviceInstanceName and serviceName or for neither of them.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service that serviceInstanceName is associated with.
          Don't  specify  to keep the component's current service instance at-
          tachment. Specify an empty string to detach the component  from  the
          service instance it's attached to. Specify non-empty values for both
          serviceInstanceName and serviceName or for neither of them.

       --service-spec (string)
          The service spec that you want the component to use to  access  ser-
          vice  inputs. Set this only when the component is attached to a ser-
          vice instance.

       --template-file (string)
          A path to the Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  file  describing  infra-
          structure that a custom component provisions.

          NOTE:
              Components  support a single IaC file, even if you use Terraform
              as your template language.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Disable automatic pagination.

       The formatting style for command output.
