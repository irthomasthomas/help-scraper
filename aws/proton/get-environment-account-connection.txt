       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-environment-account-connection
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  ID  of  the environment account connection that you want to get
          the detailed data for.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       environmentAccountConnection -> (structure)
          The detailed data of the requested environment account connection.

          arn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the environment account con-
              nection.

          componentRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role that Pro-
              ton  uses  when  provisioning directly defined components in the
              associated environment account. It determines the scope  of  in-
              frastructure that a component can provision in the account.

              The  environment account connection must have a componentRoleArn
              to allow directly defined components to be associated  with  any
              environments running in the account.

              For  more information about components, see Proton components in
              the Proton Administrator Guide .
