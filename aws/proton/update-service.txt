UPDATE-SERVICE()                                              UPDATE-SERVICE()



NAME
       update-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Edit  a service description or use a spec to add and delete service in-
       stances.

       NOTE:
          Existing service instances and the service pipeline can't be  edited
          using this API. They can only be deleted.

       Use the description parameter to modify the description.

       Edit the spec parameter to add or delete instances.

       NOTE:
          You  can't delete a service instance (remove it from the spec) if it
          has an attached component.

          For more information about components, see Proton components in  the
          Proton User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          The edited service description.

       --name (string)
          The name of the service to edit.

       --spec (string)
          Lists  the  service  instances  to  add and the existing service in-
          stances to remain. Omit the existing  service  instances  to  delete
          from the list. Don't include edits to the existing service instances
          or pipeline. For more information, see Edit a service in the  Proton
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a service

       The following update-service example edits a service description.

          aws proton update-service \
              --name "MySimpleService" \
              --description "Edit by updating description"

       Output:

          {
              "service": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:service/MySimpleService",
