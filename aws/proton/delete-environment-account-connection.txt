NAME
       delete-environment-account-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       In an environment account, delete an environment account connection.

       After  you  delete an environment account connection thats in use by an
       Proton environment, Proton cant manage the  environment  infrastructure
       resources  until  a  new environment account connection is accepted for
       the environment account and associated environment. You're  responsible
       for  cleaning  up provisioned resources that remain without an environ-
       ment connection.

       For more information, see Environment account connections in the Proton
       Administrator guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-environment-account-connection
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the environment account connection to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       environmentAccountConnection -> (structure)
          The detailed  data  of  the  environment  account  connection  being
          deleted.

          arn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the environment account con-
              nection.

          componentRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role that Pro-
              ton  uses  when  provisioning directly defined components in the
              associated environment account. It determines the scope  of  in-
              frastructure that a component can provision in the account.

              The  environment account connection must have a componentRoleArn
              to allow directly defined components to be associated  with  any
              environments running in the account.
