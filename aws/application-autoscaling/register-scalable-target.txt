REGISTER-SCALABLE-TARGET()                          REGISTER-SCALABLE-TARGET()



NAME
       register-scalable-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  or updates a scalable target, which is the resource that you
       want to scale.

       Scalable targets are uniquely identified by the combination of resource
       ID,  scalable  dimension, and namespace, which represents some capacity
       dimension of the underlying service.

       When you register a new scalable target, you must  specify  values  for
       the  minimum and maximum capacity. If the specified resource is not ac-
       tive in the target service, this operation  does  not  change  the  re-
       source's current capacity. Otherwise, it changes the resource's current
       capacity to a value that is inside of this range.

       If you add a scaling policy, current capacity is adjustable within  the
       specified  range  when scaling starts. Application Auto Scaling scaling
       policies will not scale capacity to values that are outside of the min-
       imum and maximum range.

       After  you  register  a scalable target, you do not need to register it
       again to use other Application Auto Scaling operations.  To  see  which
       resources  have  been registered, use DescribeScalableTargets . You can
       also view the  scaling  policies  for  a  service  namespace  by  using
       DescribeScalableTargets  . If you no longer need a scalable target, you
       can deregister it by using DeregisterScalableTarget .

       To update a scalable target, specify the parameters that  you  want  to
       change.  Include  the parameters that identify the scalable target: re-
       source ID, scalable dimension, and namespace. Any parameters  that  you
       don't specify are not changed by this update request.

       NOTE:
          If  you  call  the  RegisterScalableTarget API operation to create a
          scalable target, there might be a brief delay  until  the  operation
          achieves eventual consistency . You might become aware of this brief
          delay if you get unexpected errors when performing sequential opera-
          tions. The typical strategy is to retry the request, and some Amazon
          Web Services SDKs include automatic backoff and retry logic.

          If you call the RegisterScalableTarget API operation  to  update  an
          existing  scalable  target,  Application  Auto Scaling retrieves the
          current capacity of the resource. If it's below the minimum capacity
          or  above the maximum capacity, Application Auto Scaling adjusts the
          capacity of the scalable target to place  it  within  these  bounds,
          even if you don't include the MinCapacity or MaxCapacity request pa-
          rameters.

       --min-capacity (integer)
          The  minimum value that you plan to scale in to. When a scaling pol-
          icy is in effect, Application Auto Scaling can scale  in  (contract)
          as  needed to the minimum capacity limit in response to changing de-
          mand. This property is required when registering a new scalable tar-
          get.

          For the following resources, the minimum value allowed is 0.

          o AppStream 2.0 fleets

          o Aurora DB clusters

          o ECS services

          o EMR clusters

          o Lambda provisioned concurrency

          o SageMaker endpoint variants

          o SageMaker inference components

          o SageMaker serverless endpoint provisioned concurrency

          o Spot Fleets

          o custom resources

          It's strongly recommended that you specify a value greater than 0. A
          value greater than 0 means that data  points  are  continuously  re-
          ported  to  CloudWatch  that  scaling policies can use to scale on a
          metric like average CPU utilization.

          For all other resources, the minimum allowed value  depends  on  the
          type  of resource that you are using. If you provide a value that is
          lower than what a resource can accept, an  error  occurs.  In  which
          case,  the error message will provide the minimum value that the re-
          source can accept.

       --max-capacity (integer)
          The maximum value that you plan to scale out to. When a scaling pol-
          icy is in effect, Application Auto Scaling can scale out (expand) as
          needed to the maximum capacity limit in response to changing demand.
          This property is required when registering a new scalable target.

          Although you can specify a large maximum capacity, note that service
          quotas might impose lower limits. Each service has its  own  default
          quotas  for  the  maximum  capacity  of the resource. If you want to
          specify a higher limit, you can request an increase. For more infor-
          mation,  consult the documentation for that service. For information
          about the default quotas for each service, see Service endpoints and
          quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --role-arn (string)
          This  parameter  is  required  for services that do not support ser-
          vice-linked roles (such as Amazon EMR), and it must specify the  ARN
          of  an  IAM  role that allows Application Auto Scaling to modify the
          scalable target on your behalf.

          If the service supports service-linked roles, Application Auto Scal-
          ing  uses a service-linked role, which it creates if it does not yet
          exist. For more information, see How Application Auto Scaling  works
          with IAM .

       --suspended-state (structure)
          An  embedded  object  that  contains attributes and attribute values
          that are used to suspend and resume automatic scaling.  Setting  the
          value of an attribute to true suspends the specified scaling activi-
          ties. Setting it to false (default) resumes  the  specified  scaling
          activities.
              Suspension Outcomes

          o For  DynamicScalingInSuspended  , while a suspension is in effect,
            all scale-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy are
            suspended.

          o For  DynamicScalingOutSuspended , while a suspension is in effect,
            all scale-out activities that are triggered by  a  scaling  policy
            are suspended.

          o For  ScheduledScalingSuspended  , while a suspension is in effect,
            all scaling activities that involve  scheduled  actions  are  sus-
            pended.

          For more information, see Suspend and resume scaling in the Applica-
          tion Auto Scaling User Guide .

          DynamicScalingInSuspended -> (boolean)
              Whether scale in by a target tracking scaling policy or  a  step
              scaling  policy is suspended. Set the value to true if you don't
              want Application Auto Scaling to remove capacity when a  scaling
              policy is triggered. The default is false .

          DynamicScalingOutSuspended -> (boolean)
              Whether  scale out by a target tracking scaling policy or a step
              scaling policy is suspended. Set the value to true if you  don't
              want  Application  Auto  Scaling  to add capacity when a scaling
              policy is triggered. The default is false .

          ScheduledScalingSuspended -> (boolean)
              Whether scheduled scaling is suspended. Set the value to true if
              you  don't want Application Auto Scaling to add or remove capac-
              ity by initiating scheduled actions. The default is false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DynamicScalingInSuspended=boolean,DynamicScalingOutSuspended=boolean,ScheduledScalingSuspended=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DynamicScalingInSuspended": true|false,
            "DynamicScalingOutSuspended": true|false,
            "ScheduledScalingSuspended": true|false
          }

       --tags (map)
          Assigns one or more tags to the scalable target. Use this  parameter
          to  tag  the  scalable target when it is created. To tag an existing
          scalable target, use the  TagResource operation.

          Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and
          the  tag  value are required. You cannot have more than one tag on a
          scalable target with the same tag key.

          Use tags to control access to a scalable target. For  more  informa-
          tion, see Tagging support for Application Auto Scaling in the Appli-
          cation Auto Scaling User Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To register an ECS service as a scalable target

       The following register-scalable-target example registers an Amazon  ECS
       service  with Application Auto Scaling. It also adds a tag with the key
       name environment and the value production to the scalable target.

          aws application-autoscaling register-scalable-target \
              --service-namespace ecs \
              --scalable-dimension ecs:service:DesiredCount \
              --resource-id service/default/web-app \
              --min-capacity 1 --max-capacity 10 \
              --tags environment=production

       Output:

          {
              "ScalableTargetARN": "arn:aws:application-autoscaling:us-west-2:123456789012:scalable-target/1234abcd56ab78cd901ef1234567890ab123"
          }

       For examples for other AWS services and custom resources, see the  top-
       ics  in  AWS services that you can use with Application Auto Scaling in
       the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.

       Example 2: To suspend scaling activities for a scalable target

       The following register-scalable-target example suspends scaling activi-
       ties for an existing scalable target.

          aws application-autoscaling register-scalable-target \
              --service-namespace dynamodb \
              --scalable-dimension dynamodb:table:ReadCapacityUnits \
              --resource-id table/my-table \
              --suspended-state DynamicScalingInSuspended=true,DynamicScalingOutSuspended=true,ScheduledScalingSuspended=true

       Output:

          {
              "ScalableTargetARN": "arn:aws:application-autoscaling:us-west-2:123456789012:scalable-target/1234abcd56ab78cd901ef1234567890ab123"
          }

       For  more information, see Suspending and resuming scaling for Applica-
       tion Auto Scaling in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.

       Example 3: To resume scaling activities for a scalable target

       The following register-scalable-target example resumes scaling  activi-
       ties for an existing scalable target.

          aws application-autoscaling register-scalable-target \
              --service-namespace dynamodb \
              --scalable-dimension dynamodb:table:ReadCapacityUnits \
              --resource-id table/my-table \
              --suspended-state DynamicScalingInSuspended=false,DynamicScalingOutSuspended=false,ScheduledScalingSuspended=false

       Output:

          {
              "ScalableTargetARN": "arn:aws:application-autoscaling:us-west-2:123456789012:scalable-target/1234abcd56ab78cd901ef1234567890ab123"
          }

       For  more information, see Suspending and resuming scaling for Applica-
       tion Auto Scaling in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ScalableTargetARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the scalable target.
