NAME
       get-predictive-scaling-forecast -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the forecast data for a predictive scaling policy.

       Load forecasts are predictions of the hourly load values using histori-
       cal load data from CloudWatch and an analysis of historical trends. Ca-
       pacity  forecasts  are  represented as predicted values for the minimum
       capacity that is needed on an hourly basis, based on  the  hourly  load
       forecast.

       A  minimum  of 24 hours of data is required to create the initial fore-
       casts. However, having a full 14 days of  historical  data  results  in
       more accurate forecasts.

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  inclusive start time of the time range for the forecast data to
          get. At most, the date and time can be one year before  the  current
          date and time

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  exclusive  end  time of the time range for the forecast data to

          days.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                        ent types of metrics for each metric type:  one  is  a
                        load metric and one is a scaling metric.

                     ResourceLabel -> (string)
                        A  label  that  uniquely  identifies a specific target
                        group from which to determine the  total  and  average

                        One or more metric data queries to provide data points
                        for a metric specification.

                        (structure)
                            The metric data to return.  Also  defines  whether
                            this  call  is returning data for one metric only,
                            or whether it is performing a math  expression  on
                            the values of returned metric statistics to create
                            a new time series. A time series is  a  series  of
                            data  points,  each  of which is associated with a
                            timestamp.

                            Id -> (string)
                               A short name that identifies the  object's  re-
                               sults in the response. This name must be unique
                               among all MetricDataQuery objects specified for
                               a  single scaling policy. If you are performing
                               math expressions on this set of data, this name
                               represents  that  data and can serve as a vari-
                               able in the mathematical expression. The  valid
                               characters  are  letters,  numbers,  and under-
                               scores. The first character must be a lowercase
                               letter.

                            Expression -> (string)
                               The  math expression to perform on the returned
                               data, if this object is performing a  math  ex-
                               pression. This expression can use the Id of the
                               other metrics to refer to  those  metrics,  and
                               can also use the Id of other expressions to use
                               the result of those expressions.

                               Conditional: Within  each  MetricDataQuery  ob-
                               ject,  you  must  specify  either Expression or
                               MetricStat , but not both.

                            MetricStat -> (structure)
                               Information about the metric data to return.

                               Conditional: Within  each  MetricDataQuery  ob-
                               ject,  you  must  specify  either Expression or
                               MetricStat , but not both.

                               Metric -> (structure)
                                   The CloudWatch metric to return,  including
                                   the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.
                                   To get the exact  metric  name,  namespace,
                                   and  dimensions,  inspect the Metric object
                                   that is returned by a call to ListMetrics .

                                   Dimensions -> (list)
                                      Describes the dimensions of the metric.

                                      (structure)
                                          Describes the dimension of a metric.

                                          Name -> (string)

                                   MetricName -> (string)
                                      The name of the metric.

                                   Namespace -> (string)
                                      The namespace of the metric.

                               Stat -> (string)
                                   The statistic to return. It can include any
                                   CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.
                                   For a list of valid values, see  the  table
                                   in Statistics in the Amazon CloudWatch User
                                   Guide .

                                   The most commonly used metrics for  predic-
                                   tive scaling are Average and Sum .

                               Unit -> (string)
                                   The  unit  to  use  for  the  returned data
                                   points. For a complete list  of  the  units
                                   that    CloudWatch    supports,   see   the
                                   MetricDatum data type in the Amazon  Cloud-
                                   Watch API Reference .

                            Label -> (string)
                               A  human-readable  label for this metric or ex-
                               pression. This is especially useful if this  is
                               a  math  expression,  so that you know what the
                               value represents.

                            ReturnData -> (boolean)
                               Indicates whether to return the timestamps  and
                               raw data values of this metric.

                               If  you  use any math expressions, specify true
                               for this value for only the final math  expres-
                               sion that the metric specification is based on.
                               You must specify false for ReturnData  for  all
                               the  other  metrics and expressions used in the
                               metric specification.

                               If you are only retrieving metrics and not per-
                               forming  any  math  expressions, do not specify
                               anything for ReturnData . This sets it  to  its
                               default (true ).

                 CustomizedLoadMetricSpecification -> (structure)

                     MetricDataQueries -> (list)
                        One or more metric data queries to provide data points
                        for a metric specification.

                        (structure)
                            The metric data to return.  Also  defines  whether
                            this  call  is returning data for one metric only,
                            or whether it is performing a math  expression  on
                            the values of returned metric statistics to create
                            a new time series. A time series is  a  series  of
                            data  points,  each  of which is associated with a
                            timestamp.

                            Id -> (string)
                               A short name that identifies the  object's  re-

                               pression. This expression can use the Id of the
                               other metrics to refer to  those  metrics,  and
                               can also use the Id of other expressions to use
                               the result of those expressions.

                               A  human-readable  label for this metric or ex-
                               pression. This is especially useful if this  is
                               a  math  expression,  so that you know what the
                               value represents.

                            ReturnData -> (boolean)

                               raw data values of this metric.

                               If  you  use any math expressions, specify true
                               for this value for only the final math  expres-
                               sion that the metric specification is based on.
                               You must specify false for ReturnData  for  all
                               the  other  metrics and expressions used in the
                               metric specification.

                               If you are only retrieving metrics and not per-
                               forming  any  math  expressions, do not specify
                               anything for ReturnData . This sets it  to  its
                               default (true ).

                            this  call  is returning data for one metric only,
                            or whether it is performing a math  expression  on
                            the values of returned metric statistics to create
                            a new time series. A time series is  a  series  of
                            data  points,  each  of which is associated with a
