DESCRIPTION
          Introduction

       The  Amazon IVS Chat control-plane API enables you to create and manage
       Amazon IVS Chat resources. You also need to integrate with  the  Amazon
       IVS Chat Messaging API , to enable users to interact with chat rooms in
       real time.

       The API is an AWS regional service. For a list of supported regions and
       Amazon IVS Chat HTTPS service endpoints, see the Amazon IVS Chat infor-
       mation on the Amazon IVS page in the AWS General Reference .
          Notes on terminology:

       o You create service applications using the Amazon IVS Chat API. We re-
         fer to these as applications .

       o You  create  front-end  client  applications (browser and Android/iOS
         apps) using the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API. We refer to  these  as
         clients .
          Resources

       The following resource is part of Amazon IVS Chat:

       o Room  The central Amazon IVS Chat resource through which clients con-
         nect to and exchange chat messages. See the Room endpoints  for  more
         information.
          Tagging

       A  tag  is  a  metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag
       comprises a key and a value , both set by you. For example,  you  might
       set  a  tag  as  topic:nature to label a particular video category. See
       Tagging AWS Resources for more information, including restrictions that
       apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS Chat
       has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.

       Tags can help you identify and organize your AWS resources.  For  exam-
       ple,  you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that
       they are related. You can also use tags to manage  access  (see  Access
       Tags ).

       The Amazon IVS Chat API has these tag-related endpoints:  TagResource ,
       UntagResource , and  ListTagsForResource . The following resource  sup-
       ports tagging: Room.

       At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.
          API Access Security

       Your  Amazon  IVS  Chat applications (service applications and clients)
       must be authenticated and authorized to  access  Amazon  IVS  Chat  re-
       sources. Note the differences between these concepts:

       o Authentication  is  about  verifying identity. Requests to the Amazon
         IVS Chat API must be signed to verify your identity.

       o Authorization is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles  need  to
         have permissions for Amazon IVS Chat API requests.

       Users  (viewers)  connect to a room using secure access tokens that you
       create using the  CreateChatToken endpoint through  the  AWS  SDK.  You
       call CreateChatToken for every users chat session, passing identity and
       authorization information about the user.
          Signing API Requests

       HTTP API requests must be signed with an AWS SigV4 signature using your
       AWS  security credentials. The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the
       AWS SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls  for  you.  How-
       ever,  if your application calls the Amazon IVS Chat HTTP API directly,
       its your responsibility to sign the requests.

       You generate a signature using valid AWS credentials for  an  IAM  role
       that  has  permission  to  perform  the  requested action. For example,
       DeleteMessage requests must be made using an  IAM  role  that  has  the
       ivschat:DeleteMessage permission.

       For more information:

       o Authentication and generating signatures  See Authenticating Requests
         (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon Web  Services
         General Reference .

       o Managing  Amazon  IVS permissions  See Identity and Access Management
         on the Security page of the Amazon IVS User Guide .
          Messaging Endpoints

       o DeleteMessage  Sends an  event  to  a  specific  room  which  directs
         clients  to delete a specific message; that is, unrender it from view
         and delete it from the clients chat history. This events EventName is
         aws:DELETE_MESSAGE  . This replicates the DeleteMessage WebSocket op-
         eration in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API.

       o DisconnectUser  Disconnects all connections using a specified user ID
         from  a  room. This replicates the DisconnectUser WebSocket operation
         in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API.

       o SendEvent  Sends an event to a room. Use this  within  your  applica-
         tions  business  logic  to send events to clients of a room; e.g., to
         notify clients to change the way the chat UI is rendered.
          Chat Token Endpoint

       o CreateChatToken  Creates an encrypted token that is used to establish
         an  individual WebSocket connection to a room. The token is valid for
         one minute, and a connection (session) established with the token  is
         valid for the specified duration.
          Room Endpoints

       o CreateRoom   Creates  a  room that allows clients to connect and pass
         messages.

       o DeleteRoom  Deletes the specified room.

       o GetRoom  Gets the specified room.

       o ListRooms  Gets summary information about all your rooms in  the  AWS
         region where the API request is processed.

       o UpdateRoom  Updates a rooms configuration.
          Tags Endpoints

       o ListTagsForResource   Gets  information about AWS tags for the speci-
         fied ARN.

       o TagResource  Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the spec-
         ified ARN.

       o UntagResource  Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN.

       All  the  above  are HTTP operations. There is a separate messaging API
       for managing Chat resources; see the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API Ref-
       erence .
