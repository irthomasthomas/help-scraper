DESCRIPTION
          Introduction

       The  Amazon IVS Chat control-plane API enables you to create and manage
       Amazon IVS Chat resources. You also need to integrate with  the  Amazon
       IVS Chat Messaging API , to enable users to interact with chat rooms in
       real time.

       The API is an AWS regional service. For a list of supported regions and
       Amazon IVS Chat HTTPS service endpoints, see the Amazon IVS Chat infor-
       mation on the Amazon IVS page in the AWS General Reference .
          Notes on terminology:

       o You create service applications using the Amazon IVS Chat API. We re-
         fer to these as applications .

       o You  create  front-end  client  applications (browser and Android/iOS
         apps) using the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API. We refer to  these  as
         clients .
          <p>  <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The following resource is part of Ama-
          zon IVS Chat:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Room</b>  The central Amazon  IVS
          Chat  resource  through  which  clients connect to and exchange chat
          messages. See the Room endpoints  for  more  information.</p>  </li>
          </ul>  <p>  <b>API  Access Security</b> </p> <p>Your Amazon IVS Chat
          applications (service applications and clients)  must  be  authenti-
          cated  and  authorized to access Amazon IVS Chat resources. Note the
          differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Authentica-
          tion</i>  is  about  verifying  identity. Requests to the Amazon IVS
          Chat API must be signed to verify your identity.</p> </li> <li>  <p>
          <i>Authorization</i>  is  about granting permissions. Your IAM roles
          need to have permissions for Amazon IVS Chat API requests.</p> </li>
          </ul>  <p>Users  (viewers) connect to a room using secure access to-
          kens that  you  create  using  the  <a>CreateChatToken</a>  endpoint
          through  the  AWS SDK. You call CreateChatToken for every users chat
          session, passing identity and authorization  information  about  the
          user.</p>  <p> <b>Signing API Requests</b> </p> <p>HTTP API requests
          must be signed with an AWS SigV4 signature using your  AWS  security
          credentials.  The  AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the AWS SDKs
          take care of signing the underlying API calls for you.  However,  if
          your  application  calls  the Amazon IVS Chat HTTP API directly, its
          your responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You generate a sig-
          nature  using valid AWS credentials for an IAM role that has permis-
          sion to perform the requested action. For example, DeleteMessage re-
          quests   must   be   made   using   an   IAM   role   that  has  the
          <code>ivschat:DeleteMessage</code> permission.</p> <p>For  more  in-
          formation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Authentication and generating signatures

          </ul>   <p>   <b>Messaging   Endpoints</b>   </p>   <ul>   <li>  <p>
          <a>DeleteMessage</a>  Sends an event to a specific  room  which  di-
          rects  clients  to  delete  a specific message; that is, unrender it
          from view and delete it from the clients chat history.  This  events
          <code>EventName</code>   is   <code>aws:DELETE_MESSAGE</code>.  This
          replicates   the    <a    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/lat-

          ing  API.</p>  </li> <li> <p> <a>DisconnectUser</a>  Disconnects all
          connections using a specified user ID from a room.  This  replicates

          your  applications  business  logic  to  send events to clients of a
          room; e.g., to notify clients to change the way the chat UI is  ren-
          dered.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Chat Token Endpoint</b> </p> <ul> <li>
          <p> <a>CreateChatToken</a>  Creates an encrypted token that is  used
          to establish an individual WebSocket connection to a room. The token
          is valid for one minute, and a connection (session) established with
          the  token  is valid for the specified duration.</p> </li> </ul> <p>
          <b>Room Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateRoom</a>   Creates
          a  room  that allows clients to connect and pass messages.</p> </li>
