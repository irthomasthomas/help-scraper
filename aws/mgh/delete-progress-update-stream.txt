DELETE-PROGRESS-UPDATE-STREAM()                DELETE-PROGRESS-UPDATE-STREAM()



NAME
       delete-progress-update-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a progress update stream, including all of its tasks, which was
       previously created as an AWS resource used for access control. This API
       has the following traits:

       o The  only  parameter  needed  for  DeleteProgressUpdateStream  is the
         stream name (same as a CreateProgressUpdateStream call).

       o The call will return, and a background  process  will  asynchronously
         delete  the  stream  and  all of its resources (tasks, associated re-
         sources, resource attributes, created artifacts).

       o If the stream takes time to be deleted, it might still show up  on  a
         ListProgressUpdateStreams call.

       o CreateProgressUpdateStream   ,   ImportMigrationTask  ,  NotifyMigra-
         tionTaskState , and all Associate[*] APIs related to  the  tasks  be-
         longing  to  the  stream  will  throw  "InvalidInputException" if the
         stream of the same name is in the process of being deleted.

       o Once the stream and all of its resources are deleted,  CreateProgres-
         sUpdateStream  for  a  stream of the same name will succeed, and that
         stream will be an entirely new  logical  resource  (without  any  re-
         sources associated with the old stream).

OPTIONS
       --progress-update-stream-name (string)
          The  name of the ProgressUpdateStream. Do not store personal data in
          this field.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Optional boolean flag to indicate whether  any  effect  should  take
          place. Used to test if the caller has permission to make the call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
