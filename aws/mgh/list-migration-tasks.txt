LIST-MIGRATION-TASKS()                                  LIST-MIGRATION-TASKS()



NAME
       list-migration-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all,  or  filtered  by resource name, migration tasks associated
       with the user account making this call.  This  API  has  the  following
       traits:

       o Can show a summary list of the most recent migration tasks.

       o Can  show  a  summary list of migration tasks associated with a given
         discovered resource.

       o Lists migration tasks in a paginated interface.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-migration-tasks is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: MigrationTaskSummaryList

OPTIONS
       --resource-name (string)
          Filter migration tasks by discovered resource name.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are more migration tasks than the max  result,  return  the
          next  token  to be passed to the next call as a bookmark of where to
          start from.

       MigrationTaskSummaryList -> (list)
          Lists the migration task's summary which includes: MigrationTaskName
          ,  ProgressPercent , ProgressUpdateStream , Status , and the Update-
          DateTime for each task.

          (structure)
              MigrationTaskSummary includes MigrationTaskName  ,  ProgressPer-
              cent  ,  ProgressUpdateStream  , Status , and UpdateDateTime for
              each task.

              ProgressUpdateStream -> (string)
                 An AWS resource used for access control. It  should  uniquely
                 identify  the  migration  tool  as it is used for all updates
                 made by the tool.

              MigrationTaskName -> (string)
                 Unique identifier that references the migration task. Do  not
                 store personal data in this field.

                 Indication of the percentage completion of the task.

              StatusDetail -> (string)
                 Detail  information  of what is being done within the overall
                 status state.

              UpdateDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the task was gathered.
