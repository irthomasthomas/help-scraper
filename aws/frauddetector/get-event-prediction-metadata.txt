OPTIONS
       --event-id (string)
          The event ID.

       --event-type-name (string)
          The  event  type associated with the detector specified for the pre-
          diction.

       --detector-id (string)
          The detector ID.

       --detector-version-id (string)
          The detector version ID.

       --prediction-timestamp (string)
          The timestamp that defines when the prediction  was  generated.  The
          timestamp must be specified using ISO 8601 standard in UTC.

          We  recommend calling ListEventPredictions first, and using the pre-
          dictionTimestamp value in the response to provide an  accurate  pre-
          diction timestamp value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                                   - infinity to + infinity.

                                   o A positive value indicates that the vari-
                                     able drove the risk score up.

                                   o A negative value indicates that the vari-
                                     able drove the risk score down.

                            Account Takeover Insights (ATI) model  uses  event
                            variables  from the login data you provide to con-
                            tinuously calculate a set of variables (aggregated
                            variables)  based  on historical events. For exam-
                            ple, your ATI model might calculate the number  of
                            times  an user has logged in using the same IP ad-
                            dress. In this case, event variables used  to  de-
                            rive  the  aggregated variables are IP address and
                            user .

                               late  a set of variables (aggregated variables)
                               based on historical events.  For  example,  the
                               model  might  calculate  the number of times an
                               user has logged in using the same  IP  address.
                               In  this  case,  event variables used to derive
                               the aggregated variables  are  IP  address  and
                               user .

                                   ables in terms of magnitude on the  predic-
                                   tion scores.
