OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The detector ID.

       --detector-version-id (string)
          The detector version ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          The detector version description.

       externalModelEndpoints -> (list)
          The Amazon SageMaker model endpoints included in the  detector  ver-
          sion.

          (string)

       modelVersions -> (list)
          The model versions included in the detector version.

          (structure)
              The model version.

              modelId -> (string)
                 The model ID.

              modelType -> (string)
                 The model type.

              modelVersionNumber -> (string)
                 The model version number.

              arn -> (string)
                 The model version ARN.

       rules -> (list)
          The rules included in the detector version.

          (structure)
              A rule.

              detectorId -> (string)
                 The detector for which the rule is associated.

              ruleId -> (string)
                 The rule ID.

              ruleVersion -> (string)
                 The rule version.

       status -> (string)
          The status of the detector version.

       lastUpdatedTime -> (string)
          The timestamp when the detector version was last updated.

       createdTime -> (string)
          The timestamp when the detector version was created.

       ruleExecutionMode -> (string)
          The execution mode of the rule in the dectector
              FIRST_MATCHED  indicates  that  Amazon  Fraud Detector evaluates
              rules sequentially, first to last, stopping at the first matched
              rule. Amazon Fraud dectector then provides the outcomes for that
              single rule.

              ALL_MATCHED indicates that Amazon Fraud Detector  evaluates  all
              rules  and  returns  the outcomes for all matched rules. You can
              define and edit the rule mode at  the  detector  version  level,
              when it is in draft status.

       arn -> (string)
          The detector version ARN.
