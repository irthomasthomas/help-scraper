NAME
       update-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  new  columns to the table or updates one of the table's settings,
       for example capacity mode, auto scaling, encryption, point-in-time  re-
       covery, or ttl settings. Note that you can only update one specific ta-
       ble setting per update operation.

       --auto-scaling-specification (structure)
          The optional auto scaling settings to update for a table  in  provi-
          sioned capacity mode. Specifies if the service can manage throughput
          capacity of a provisioned table automatically on your behalf. Amazon
          Keyspaces  auto  scaling helps you provision throughput capacity for
          variable workloads efficiently by increasing and decreasing your ta-
          ble's  read and write capacity automatically in response to applica-
          tion traffic.

          If auto scaling is already enabled for the table, you  can  use  Up-
          dateTable to update the minimum and maximum values or the auto scal-
          ing policy settings independently.

          For more information, see Managing throughput capacity automatically
          with Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer
          Guide .

          writeCapacityAutoScaling -> (structure)
              The auto scaling settings for the table's write capacity.

              autoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
                 This optional parameter enables auto scaling for the table if
                 set to false .

              minimumUnits -> (long)
                 The  minimum  level  of throughput the table should always be
                 ready to support. The value must be between  1  and  the  max
                 throughput  per  second quota for your account (40,000 by de-
                 fault).

              maximumUnits -> (long)
                 Manage costs by specifying the maximum amount  of  throughput
                 to  provision.  The  value  must  be  between  1  and the max
                 throughput per second quota for your account (40,000  by  de-
                 fault).

              scalingPolicy -> (structure)
                 Amazon  Keyspaces  supports  the target tracking auto scaling
                 policy. With this policy, Amazon Keyspaces auto  scaling  en-
                 sures  that  the table's ratio of consumed to provisioned ca-
                 pacity stays at or near the target value  that  you  specify.
                 You  define  the  target value as a percentage between 20 and
                 90.

                 targetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Auto scaling scales up capacity automatically when  traf-
                     fic  exceeds  this target utilization rate, and then back
                     down when it falls below the target. A double between  20
                     and 90.

                     disableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                        Specifies if scale-in is enabled.

                        When auto scaling automatically decreases capacity for
                        a table, the table scales in . When  scaling  policies
                        are  set, they can't scale in the table lower than its
                        minimum capacity.

                     scaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                        Specifies a scale-in cool down period.

                        A cooldown period in seconds between  scaling  activi-
                        ties  that  lets  the  table  stabilize before another
                        scaling activity starts.

                     scaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                        Specifies a scale out cool down period.

                        A cooldown period in seconds between  scaling  activi-
                        ties  that  lets  the  table  stabilize before another
                        scaling activity starts.

                     targetValue -> (double)
                        Specifies the target value  for  the  target  tracking
                        auto scaling policy.

                        Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling scales up capacity auto-
                        matically when traffic exceeds this target utilization
                        rate,  and then back down when it falls below the tar-
                        get. This ensures that the ratio of consumed  capacity
                        to  provisioned  capacity stays at or near this value.
                        You define targetValue as a percentage. A  double  be-
                        tween 20 and 90.

          readCapacityAutoScaling -> (structure)
              The auto scaling settings for the table's read capacity.

              autoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
                 This optional parameter enables auto scaling for the table if
                 set to false .

              minimumUnits -> (long)
                 The minimum level of throughput the table  should  always  be
                 ready  to  support.  The  value must be between 1 and the max
                 throughput per second quota for your account (40,000  by  de-
                 fault).

              maximumUnits -> (long)
                 Manage  costs  by specifying the maximum amount of throughput
                 to provision. The  value  must  be  between  1  and  the  max
                 throughput  per  second quota for your account (40,000 by de-
                 fault).

              scalingPolicy -> (structure)
                 Amazon Keyspaces supports the target  tracking  auto  scaling
                 policy.  With  this policy, Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling en-
                 sures that the table's ratio of consumed to  provisioned  ca-
                 pacity  stays  at  or near the target value that you specify.
                 You define the target value as a percentage  between  20  and
                 90.

                 targetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Auto  scaling scales up capacity automatically when traf-
                     fic exceeds this target utilization rate, and  then  back
                     down  when it falls below the target. A double between 20
                     and 90.

                     disableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                        Specifies if scale-in is enabled.

                        When auto scaling automatically decreases capacity for
                        a  table,  the table scales in . When scaling policies
                        are set, they can't scale in the table lower than  its
                        minimum capacity.

                     scaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                        Specifies a scale-in cool down period.

                        A  cooldown  period in seconds between scaling activi-
                        ties that lets  the  table  stabilize  before  another
                        scaling activity starts.

                     scaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                        Specifies a scale out cool down period.

                        A  cooldown  period in seconds between scaling activi-
                        ties that lets  the  table  stabilize  before  another
                        scaling activity starts.

                     targetValue -> (double)
                        Specifies  the  target  value  for the target tracking
                        auto scaling policy.

                        Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling scales up capacity auto-
                        matically when traffic exceeds this target utilization

              this by configuring the following parameters.

              o region  :  The  Region  where these settings are applied. (Re-
                quired)

              o readCapacityUnits : The provisioned read capacity units.  (Op-
                tional)

              o readCapacityAutoScaling  : The read capacity auto scaling set-
                tings for the table. (Optional)

              region -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region.

              readCapacityUnits -> (long)
                 The provisioned read capacity units for the multi-Region  ta-
                 ble in the specified Amazon Web Services Region.

              readCapacityAutoScaling -> (structure)
                 The  read capacity auto scaling settings for the multi-Region
                 table in the specified Amazon Web Services Region.

                 autoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
                     This optional parameter enables auto scaling for the  ta-
                     ble if set to false .

                 minimumUnits -> (long)
                     The  minimum  level of throughput the table should always
                     be ready to support. The value must be between 1 and  the
                     max  throughput per second quota for your account (40,000
                     by default).

                 maximumUnits -> (long)
                     Manage costs by specifying the maximum amount of through-
                     put to provision. The value must be between 1 and the max
                     throughput per second quota for your account  (40,000  by
                     default).

                 scalingPolicy -> (structure)
                     Amazon  Keyspaces supports the target tracking auto scal-
                     ing policy. With this policy, Amazon Keyspaces auto scal-
                     ing  ensures that the table's ratio of consumed to provi-
                     sioned capacity stays at or near the  target  value  that
                     you  specify. You define the target value as a percentage
                     between 20 and 90.

                     targetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Auto scaling scales  up  capacity  automatically  when
                        traffic exceeds this target utilization rate, and then
                        back down when it falls below the target. A double be-
                        tween 20 and 90.

                        disableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                            Specifies if scale-in is enabled.

                            When auto scaling automatically decreases capacity
                            for a table, the table scales in  .  When  scaling
                            policies  are  set,  they can't scale in the table
                            lower than its minimum capacity.

                        scaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                            Specifies a scale-in cool down period.

                            A cooldown period in seconds between  scaling  ac-
                            tivities  that lets the table stabilize before an-
                            other scaling activity starts.

                        scaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                            Specifies a scale out cool down period.

                            A cooldown period in seconds between  scaling  ac-
                            tivities  that lets the table stabilize before an-
                            other scaling activity starts.

                        targetValue -> (double)
                            Specifies the target value for the target tracking
                            auto scaling policy.

                            Amazon  Keyspaces  auto scaling scales up capacity
                            automatically when  traffic  exceeds  this  target
                            utilization rate, and then back down when it falls
                            below the target. This ensures that the  ratio  of
                            consumed capacity to provisioned capacity stays at
                            or near this value. You define  targetValue  as  a
                            percentage. A double between 20 and 90.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
