NAME
       get-table-auto-scaling-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  auto  scaling  related settings of the specified table in JSON
       format. If the table is a multi-Region table, the Amazon  Web  Services
       Region specific auto scaling settings of the table are included.

       Amazon  Keyspaces  auto scaling helps you provision throughput capacity
       for variable workloads efficiently by increasing  and  decreasing  your
       table's  read  and write capacity automatically in response to applica-
       tion traffic. For more information, see  Managing  throughput  capacity
       automatically   with  Amazon  Keyspaces  auto  scaling  in  the  Amazon
       Keyspaces Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --keyspace-name (string)
          The name of the keyspace.

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

              autoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
                 This optional parameter enables auto scaling for the table if
                 set to false .

              minimumUnits -> (long)
                 The minimum level of throughput the table  should  always  be
                 ready  to  support.  The  value must be between 1 and the max
                 throughput per second quota for your account (40,000  by  de-
                 fault).

              maximumUnits -> (long)
                 Manage  costs  by specifying the maximum amount of throughput
                 to provision. The  value  must  be  between  1  and  the  max
                 throughput  per  second quota for your account (40,000 by de-

              scalingPolicy -> (structure)
                 Amazon Keyspaces supports the target  tracking  auto  scaling
                 policy.  With  this policy, Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling en-
                 sures that the table's ratio of consumed to  provisioned  ca-
                 pacity  stays  at  or near the target value that you specify.
                 You define the target value as a percentage  between  20  and
                 90.

                 targetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Auto  scaling scales up capacity automatically when traf-
                     fic exceeds this target utilization rate, and  then  back
                     down  when it falls below the target. A double between 20
                     and 90.

                     disableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                        Specifies if scale-in is enabled.

                        When auto scaling automatically decreases capacity for
                        a  table,  the table scales in . When scaling policies
                        are set, they can't scale in the table lower than  its
                        minimum capacity.

                     scaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                        Specifies a scale-in cool down period.

                        A  cooldown  period in seconds between scaling activi-
                        ties that lets  the  table  stabilize  before  another
                        scaling activity starts.

                     scaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                        Specifies a scale out cool down period.

                        A  cooldown  period in seconds between scaling activi-
                        ties that lets  the  table  stabilize  before  another
                        scaling activity starts.

                     targetValue -> (double)
                        Specifies  the  target  value  for the target tracking
                        auto scaling policy.

                        Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling scales up capacity auto-
                        matically when traffic exceeds this target utilization
                        rate, and then back down when it falls below the  tar-
                        get.  This ensures that the ratio of consumed capacity
                        to provisioned capacity stays at or near  this  value.
                        You  define  targetValue as a percentage. A double be-
                        tween 20 and 90.

              minimumUnits -> (long)
                 The  minimum  level  of throughput the table should always be
                 ready to support. The value must be between  1  and  the  max
                 throughput  per  second quota for your account (40,000 by de-
                 fault).

              maximumUnits -> (long)
                 Manage costs by specifying the maximum amount  of  throughput
                 to  provision.  The  value  must  be  between  1  and the max
                 throughput per second quota for your account (40,000  by  de-
                 fault).

                        auto  scaling  ensures  that the table's ratio of con-
                        sumed to provisioned capacity stays  at  or  near  the
                        target  value  that you specify. You define the target
                        value as a percentage between 20 and 90.

                        targetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration  ->   (struc-
                        ture)
                            Auto scaling scales up capacity automatically when
                            traffic exceeds this target utilization rate,  and
                            then  back  down when it falls below the target. A
                            double between 20 and 90.

                            disableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                               Specifies if scale-in is enabled.

                               When auto scaling automatically  decreases  ca-
                               pacity  for a table, the table scales in . When
                               scaling policies are set, they can't  scale  in
                               the table lower than its minimum capacity.

                            scaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                               Specifies a scale-in cool down period.

                               A  cooldown  period  in seconds between scaling
                               activities that lets the table stabilize before
                               another scaling activity starts.

                            scaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                               Specifies a scale out cool down period.

                               A  cooldown  period  in seconds between scaling
                               activities that lets the table stabilize before
                               another scaling activity starts.

                            targetValue -> (double)
                               Specifies  the  target  value  for  the  target
                               tracking auto scaling policy.

                               Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling scales up  capac-
                               ity  automatically  when  traffic  exceeds this
                               target utilization rate,  and  then  back  down
                               when  it  falls  below the target. This ensures
                               that the ratio of consumed capacity  to  provi-
                               sioned  capacity  stays  at or near this value.
                               You define targetValue as a percentage. A  dou-
