OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The Identifier (ID) of the directory associated with the group.

       --other-attributes (list)
          One  or  more attributes to be returned for the group. For a list of
          supported attributes, see Directory Service Data Attributes .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --realm (string)
          The domain name that's associated with the group.

          NOTE:
              This parameter is optional, so you can return groups outside  of
              your Managed Microsoft AD domain. When no value is defined, only
              your Managed Microsoft AD groups are returned.

              This value is case insensitive.

       --sam-account-name (string)
          The name of the group.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          The distinguished name of the object.

       GroupScope -> (string)

              The data type for an attribute.  Each  attribute  value  is  de-
              scribed  as  a  name-value pair. The name is the AD schema name,
              and the value is the data itself. For a list  of  supported  at-
              tributes, see Directory Service Data Attributes .

                 This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following
                 top level keys can be set: BOOL, N, S, SS.

              BOOL -> (boolean)
                 Indicates that the attribute type value is a boolean. For ex-

                     "BOOL": true

              N -> (long)

                 ample:
                     "N": "16"

              S -> (string)
                 Indicates that the attribute type value is a string. For  ex-

                     "S": "S Group"

              SS -> (list)
                 Indicates  that the attribute type value is a string set. For
                 example:
                     "SS":    ["sample_service_class/host.sample.com:1234/sam-
                     ple_service_name_1",      "sample_service_class/host.sam-
