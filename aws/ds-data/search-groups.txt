SEARCH-GROUPS()                                                SEARCH-GROUPS()



NAME
       search-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches  the specified directory for a group. You can find groups that
       match the SearchString parameter with the value of their attributes in-
       cluded in the SearchString parameter.

       This  operation  supports  pagination with the use of the NextToken re-
       quest and response parameters.  If  more  results  are  available,  the
       SearchGroups.NextToken  member  contains  a  token that you pass in the
       next call to SearchGroups . This retrieves the next set of items.

       You can also specify a maximum number of return results with the MaxRe-
       sults parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       search-groups  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Groups

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier (ID) of the  directory  that's  associated  with  the
          group.

       --realm (string)
          The domain name that's associated with the group.

          NOTE:
              This  parameter is optional, so you can return groups outside of
              your Managed Microsoft AD domain. When no value is defined, only
              your Managed Microsoft AD groups are returned.

              This value is case insensitive.

       --search-attributes (list)
          One or more data attributes that are used to search for a group. For
          a list of supported  attributes,  see  Directory  Service  Data  At-
          tributes .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --search-string (string)
          The attribute value that you want to search for.

          NOTE:
              Wildcard  (*) searches aren't supported. For a list of supported
              attributes, see Directory Service Data Attributes .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     supported  attributes,  see  Directory  Service  Data At-

                     N -> (long)
                        Indicates that the attribute type value is  a  number.
