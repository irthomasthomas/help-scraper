DESCRIBE-DOMAIN()                                            DESCRIBE-DOMAIN()



NAME
       describe-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the specified domain, including description
       and status.
          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to  call  this  ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-domain
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the domain to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Getting Information About a Domain

       To get detailed information about a particular domain, use the swf  de-
       scribe-domain  command.  There is one required parameter: --name, which
       takes the name of the domain you want information about.

          aws swf describe-domain \
              --name DataFrobotz
                  {
                      "domainInfo": {
                          "status": "REGISTERED",
                          "name": "DataFrobotz"
                      },
                      "configuration": {
                          "workflowExecutionRetentionPeriodInDays": "1"
                      }
                  }

       You can also use describe-domain to get  information  about  deprecated
       domains.

          aws swf describe-domain \
              --name MyNeatNewDomain
                  {
                      "domainInfo": {
                          "status": "DEPRECATED",
                          "name": "MyNeatNewDomain"
                      },
                      "configuration": {
                          "workflowExecutionRetentionPeriodInDays": "0"
                      }
                  }

OUTPUT
       domainInfo -> (structure)

          description.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the domain. This name is unique within the account.

              o REGISTERED  The domain is properly registered  and  available.
                You can use this domain for registering types and creating new
                workflow executions.

              o DEPRECATED  The domain was deprecated using  DeprecateDomain ,
                but is still in use. You should not create new workflow execu-
                tions in this domain.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the domain provided through  RegisterDomain .

          arn -> (string)

       configuration -> (structure)
          The domain configuration. Currently, this includes only the domain's
          retention period.

          workflowExecutionRetentionPeriodInDays -> (string)
