DESCRIBE-ACTIVITY-TYPE()                              DESCRIBE-ACTIVITY-TYPE()



NAME
       describe-activity-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the specified activity type. This includes
       configuration settings provided when the type was registered and  other
       general information about the type.
          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit  the  action  to
         only specified domains.

       o Use  an  Action  element to allow or deny permission to call this ac-
         tion.

       o Constrain the following parameters by using a Condition element  with
         the appropriate keys.

         o activityType.name  :  String  constraint.  The key is swf:activity-
           Type.name .

         o activityType.version : String constraint. The key is  swf:activity-
           Type.version .

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain in which the activity type is registered.

       --activity-type (structure)
          The activity type to get information about. Activity types are iden-
          tified  by the name and version that were supplied when the activity
          was registered.

          name -> (string)
              The name of this activity.

              NOTE:
                 The combination of activity type name  and  version  must  be
                 unique within a domain.

          version -> (string)
              The version of this activity.

              NOTE:
                 The  combination  of  activity  type name and version must be
                 unique with in a domain.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "version": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

          The status of activity type (returned in the ActivityTypeInfo struc-
          ture) can be one of the following.

          o REGISTERED  The type is registered and available. Workers support-
            ing this type should be running.

          o DEPRECATED  The type was deprecated using  DeprecateActivityType ,
            but  is still in use. You should keep workers supporting this type
            running. You cannot create new tasks of this type.

          activityType -> (structure)
              The  ActivityType type structure representing the activity type.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of this activity.

                 NOTE:
                     The combination of activity type name and version must be
                     unique within a domain.

              version -> (string)
                 The version of this activity.

                 NOTE:
                     The combination of activity type name and version must be
                     unique with in a domain.

          status -> (string)
              The current status of the activity type.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the activity type provided in  RegisterActiv-
              ityType .

          creationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time this activity type was created through  Regis-
              terActivityType .

          deprecationDate -> (timestamp)
              If DEPRECATED, the  date  and  time   DeprecateActivityType  was
              called.

       configuration -> (structure)
          The configuration settings registered with the activity type.

          defaultTaskStartToCloseTimeout -> (string)
              The default maximum duration for tasks of an activity type spec-
              ified when registering the activity type. You can override  this
              default  when scheduling a task through the ScheduleActivityTask
              Decision .

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          defaultTaskHeartbeatTimeout -> (string)
              The default maximum time, in seconds, before which a worker pro-
              cessing a task must report progress by calling   RecordActivity-
              TaskHeartbeat .

              You  can  specify  this  value only when registering an activity
              type. The registered default value can be  overridden  when  you
              schedule a task through the ScheduleActivityTask   Decision . If
              the activity worker subsequently attempts to record a  heartbeat
              or  returns a result, the activity worker receives an UnknownRe-
              source fault. In this case, Amazon SWF no longer  considers  the
              activity  task  to be valid; the activity worker should clean up
              the activity task.

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          defaultTaskList -> (structure)
              The default task list specified for this activity type at regis-
              tration. This default is used if a task list isn't provided when
              a  task is scheduled through the ScheduleActivityTask   Decision
              . You can override the default registered task list when  sched-
              uling a task through the ScheduleActivityTask   Decision .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the task list.

          defaultTaskPriority -> (string)
              The default task priority for tasks of this activity type, spec-
              ified at registration. If not set, then 0 is used as the default
              priority.  This default can be overridden when scheduling an ac-
              tivity task.

              Valid  values  are  integers  that  range  from   Java's   Inte-
              ger.MIN_VALUE  (-2147483648)  to Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647).
              Higher numbers indicate higher priority.

              For more information about setting task  priority,  see  Setting
              Task Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

          defaultTaskScheduleToStartTimeout -> (string)
              The default maximum duration, specified when registering the ac-
              tivity type, that a task of an activity type can wait before be-
              ing  assigned  to  a  worker. You can override this default when
              scheduling a task through the ScheduleActivityTask   Decision .

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          defaultTaskScheduleToCloseTimeout -> (string)
              The default maximum duration, specified when registering the ac-
              tivity type, for tasks of this activity type. You  can  override
              this  default when scheduling a task through the ScheduleActivi-
              tyTask   Decision .

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.
