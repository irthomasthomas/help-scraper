RESPOND-ACTIVITY-TASK-CANCELED()              RESPOND-ACTIVITY-TASK-CANCELED()



NAME
       respond-activity-task-canceled -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  by  workers to tell the service that the  ActivityTask identified
       by the taskToken was successfully canceled. Additional details  can  be
       provided using the details argument.

       These  details  (if  provided) appear in the ActivityTaskCanceled event
       added to the workflow history.

       WARNING:
          Only use this operation if the canceled flag of  a   RecordActivity-
          TaskHeartbeat request returns true and if the activity can be safely
          undone or abandoned.

       A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled  until  it
       is  closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is pro-
       cessing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a  call  to
       RespondActivityTaskCompleted , RespondActivityTaskCanceled,  RespondAc-
       tivityTaskFailed , or the task has timed out .
          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to  call  this  ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --task-token (string)
          The taskToken of the  ActivityTask .

          WARNING:
              taskToken is generated by the service and should be  treated  as
              an  opaque  value. If the task is passed to another process, its
              taskToken must also be passed. This enables it  to  provide  its
              progress and respond with results.

       --details (string)
          Information about the cancellation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
