RECORD-ACTIVITY-TASK-HEARTBEAT()              RECORD-ACTIVITY-TASK-HEARTBEAT()



NAME
       record-activity-task-heartbeat -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  by  activity workers to report to the service that the  Activity-
       Task represented by the specified taskToken is still  making  progress.
       The  worker  can also specify details of the progress, for example per-
       cent complete, using the details parameter. This  action  can  also  be
       used by the worker as a mechanism to check if cancellation is being re-
       quested for the activity task. If a cancellation is being attempted for
       the  specified  task, then the boolean cancelRequested flag returned by
       the service is set to true .

       This action resets the taskHeartbeatTimeout clock.  The  taskHeartbeat-
       Timeout is specified in  RegisterActivityType .

       This action doesn't in itself create an event in the workflow execution
       history. However, if the task times out, the workflow execution history
       contains  a  ActivityTaskTimedOut  event  that contains the information
       from the last heartbeat generated by the activity worker.

       NOTE:
          The taskStartToCloseTimeout of an activity type is the maximum dura-
          tion of an activity task, regardless of the number of  RecordActivi-
          tyTaskHeartbeat requests received.  The  taskStartToCloseTimeout  is
          also specified in  RegisterActivityType .

       NOTE:
          This  operation  is  only useful for long-lived activities to report
          liveliness of the task and to determine if a cancellation  is  being
          attempted.

       WARNING:
              If the cancelRequested flag returns true , a cancellation is be-
              ing attempted. If the worker can cancel the activity, it  should
              respond with  RespondActivityTaskCanceled . Otherwise, it should
              ignore the cancellation request.

          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to  call  this  ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --task-token (string)
          The taskToken of the  ActivityTask .

          WARNING:
              taskToken is generated by the service and should be  treated  as
              an  opaque  value. If the task is passed to another process, its
              taskToken must also be passed. This enables it  to  provide  its
              progress and respond with results.

       --details (string)
          If specified, contains details about the progress of the task.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       cancelRequested -> (boolean)
          Set to true if cancellation of the task is requested.
