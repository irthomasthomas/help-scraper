DESCRIBE-WORKFLOW-TYPE()                              DESCRIBE-WORKFLOW-TYPE()



NAME
       describe-workflow-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the specified workflow type . This includes
       configuration settings specified when the type was registered and other
       information such as creation date, current status, etc.
          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit  the  action  to
         only specified domains.

       o Use  an  Action  element to allow or deny permission to call this ac-
         tion.

       o Constrain the following parameters by using a Condition element  with
         the appropriate keys.

         o workflowType.name  :  String  constraint.  The key is swf:workflow-
           Type.name .

         o workflowType.version : String constraint. The key is  swf:workflow-
           Type.version .

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain in which this workflow type is registered.

       --workflow-type (structure)
          The workflow type to describe.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the workflow type.

              NOTE:
                 The combination of workflow type name  and  version  must  be
                 unique with in a domain.

          version -> (string)
              The version of the workflow type.

              NOTE:
                 The  combination  of  workflow  type name and version must be
                 unique with in a domain.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "version": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

          structure) can be one of the following.

          o REGISTERED  The type is registered and available. Workers support-
            ing this type should be running.

          o DEPRECATED  The type was deprecated using  DeprecateWorkflowType ,
            but is still in use. You should keep workers supporting this  type
            running. You cannot create new workflow executions of this type.

          workflowType -> (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     The combination of workflow type name and version must be
                     unique with in a domain.

          status -> (string)
              The current status of the workflow type.

          description -> (string)
              The  description  of  the type registered through  RegisterWork-
              flowType .

          creationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date when this type was registered.

          deprecationDate -> (timestamp)
              If the type is in deprecated state, then it is set to  the  date
              when the type was deprecated.

       configuration -> (structure)
          Configuration settings of the workflow type registered through  Reg-
          isterWorkflowType

          defaultTaskStartToCloseTimeout -> (string)
              The default maximum duration,  specified  when  registering  the
              workflow type, that a decision task for executions of this work-
              flow type might take before returning completion or failure.  If
              the  task doesn'tdo close in the specified time then the task is
              automatically timed out and rescheduled. If the decider  eventu-
              ally  reports  a  completion or failure, it is ignored. This de-
              fault can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using
              the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the StartChildWorkflowExe-
              cution   Decision .

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout -> (string)
              The  default  maximum  duration,  specified when registering the
              workflow type, for executions of this workflow  type.  This  de-
              fault can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using
              the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the StartChildWorkflowExe-
              cution   Decision .

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          defaultTaskList -> (structure)
              The default task list, specified when registering  the  workflow
              type,  for  decisions tasks scheduled for workflow executions of
              this type. This default can be overridden when starting a  work-
              flow  execution  using the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the
              StartChildWorkflowExecution   Decision .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the task list.

          defaultTaskPriority -> (string)
              The default task priority, specified when registering the  work-
              flow  type,  for  all decision tasks of this workflow type. This
              default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution us-
              ing  the   StartWorkflowExecution  action or the StartChildWork-
              flowExecution decision.

              Valid  values  are  integers  that  range  from   Java's   Inte-
              ger.MIN_VALUE  (-2147483648)  to Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647).
              Higher numbers indicate higher priority.

              For more information about setting task  priority,  see  Setting
              Task Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

          defaultChildPolicy -> (string)
              The default policy to use for the child workflow executions when
              a workflow execution of this type is terminated, by calling  the
              TerminateWorkflowExecution  action  explicitly  or due to an ex-
              pired timeout. This default can be overridden  when  starting  a
              workflow  execution  using the  StartWorkflowExecution action or
              the StartChildWorkflowExecution   Decision .

              The supported child policies are:

              o TERMINATE  The child executions are terminated.

              o REQUEST_CANCEL  A request to  cancel  is  attempted  for  each
                child  execution  by  recording  a  WorkflowExecutionCancelRe-
                quested event in its history. It is up to the decider to  take
                appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with
                this event.

              o ABANDON  No action is taken. The child executions continue  to
                run.

          defaultLambdaRole -> (string)
              The default IAM role attached to this workflow type.

              NOTE:
                 Executions  of  this  workflow  type need IAM roles to invoke
                 Lambda functions. If you  don't  specify  an  IAM  role  when
                 starting  this  workflow type, the default Lambda role is at-
                 tached  to  the  execution.   For   more   information,   see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/lambda-task.html
