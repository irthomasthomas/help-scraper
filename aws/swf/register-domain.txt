REGISTER-DOMAIN()                                            REGISTER-DOMAIN()



NAME
       register-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers a new domain.
          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to control domain access  for  this  ac-
         tion. The name of the domain being registered is available as the re-
         source of this action.

       o Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to  call  this  ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Name of the domain to register. The name must be unique in  the  re-
          gion that the domain is registered in.

          The  specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It must
          not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control
          characters  (\u0000-\u001f  |  \u007f-\u009f ). Also, it must not be
          the literal string arn .

       --description (string)
          A text description of the domain.

       --workflow-execution-retention-period-in-days (string)
          The duration (in days) that records and histories of workflow execu-
          tions  on the domain should be kept by the service. After the reten-
          tion period, the workflow execution isn't available in  the  results
          of visibility calls.

          If  you pass the value NONE or 0 (zero), then the workflow execution
          history isn't retained. As soon as the workflow execution completes,
          the execution record and its history are deleted.

          The maximum workflow execution retention period is 90 days. For more
          information about Amazon SWF service limits, see: Amazon SWF Service
          Limits in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

       --tags (list)
          Tags to be added when registering a domain.

          Tags  may only contain unicode letters, digits, whitespace, or these
          symbols: _ . : / = + - @ .

          (structure)
              Tags are key-value pairs that can be associated with Amazon  SWF
              state machines and activities.

              Tags  may  only  contain unicode letters, digits, whitespace, or
              these symbols: _ . : / = + - @ .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of a tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of a tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Registering a Domain

       You  can  use  the  AWS CLI to register new domains. Use the swf regis-
       ter-domain command.  There are two required parameters,  --name,  which
       takes   the   domain   name,   and   --workflow-execution-retention-pe-
       riod-in-days, which takes an integer to specify the number of  days  to
       retain workflow execution data on this domain, up to a maxium period of
       90 days (for  more  information,  see  the  SWF  FAQ  <https://aws.ama-
       zon.com/swf/faqs/#retain_limit>).  Workflow  execution data will not be
       retained after the specified number of days have passed.

          aws swf register-domain \
              --name MyNeatNewDomain \
              --workflow-execution-retention-period-in-days 0
              ""

       When you register a domain, nothing is returned (""), but you  can  use
       swf list-domains or swf describe-domain to see the new domain.

          aws swf list-domains \
              --registration-status REGISTERED
                  {
                      "domainInfos": [
                          {
                              "status": "REGISTERED",
                              "name": "DataFrobotz"
                          },
                          {
                              "status": "REGISTERED",
                              "name": "MyNeatNewDomain"
                          },
                          {
                              "status": "REGISTERED",
                              "name": "erontest"
                          }
                      ]
                  }

       Using swf describe-domain:

          aws swf describe-domain --name MyNeatNewDomain
          {
              "domainInfo": {
                  "status": "REGISTERED",
                  "name": "MyNeatNewDomain"
              },
              "configuration": {
                  "workflowExecutionRetentionPeriodInDays": "0"
              }
          }
