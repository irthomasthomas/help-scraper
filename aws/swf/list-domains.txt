LIST-DOMAINS()                                                  LIST-DOMAINS()



NAME
       list-domains -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the list of domains registered in the account. The results may
       be split into multiple pages. To retrieve subsequent  pages,  make  the
       call again using the nextPageToken returned by the initial call.

       NOTE:
              This  operation  is  eventually consistent. The results are best
              effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains. The element must be set  to  arn:aws:swf::Ac-
         countID:domain/* , where AccountID is the account ID, with no dashes.

       o Use  an  Action  element to allow or deny permission to call this ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set  to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED  .  For  details  and example IAM policies, see
       Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in  the  Amazon  SWF
       Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-domains is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: domainInfos

SYNOPSIS
            list-domains
          --registration-status <value>
          [--reverse-order | --no-reverse-order]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registration-status (string)
          Specifies the registration status of the domains to list.

          Possible values:

          o REGISTERED

          o DEPRECATED

       --reverse-order | --no-reverse-order (boolean)
          When set to true , returns the results in reverse order. By default,
          the  results are returned in ascending alphabetical order by name of
          the domains.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list your registered domains

       The following list-domains command example lists the REGISTERED SWF do-
       mains that you have registered for your account.

          aws swf list-domains \
              --registration-status REGISTERED

       Output:

          {
            "domainInfos": [
              {
                "status": "REGISTERED",
                "name": "DataFrobotz"
              },
              {
                "status": "REGISTERED",
                "name": "erontest"
              }
            ]
          }

       Service API Reference

       Example 2: To list your deprecated domains

       The following list-domains command example lists the DEPRECATED SWF do-
       mains that you have registered for your account. Deprecated domains are
       domains that can not register new workflows or activities, but that can
       still be queried.

          aws swf list-domains \
              --registration-status DEPRECATED

       Output:

          {
            "domainInfos": [
              {
                "status": "DEPRECATED",
                "name": "MyNeatNewDomain"
              }
            ]
          }

       Service API Reference

       Example 3: To list the first page of registered domains

       The following list-domains command example lists the first page  REGIS-
       TERED  SWF  domains that you have registered for your account using the
       --maximum-page-size option.

          aws swf list-domains \
              --registration-status REGISTERED \
              --maximum-page-size 1

       Output:

          {
              "domainInfos": [
                  {
                      "status": "REGISTERED",
                      "name": "DataFrobotz"
                  }
              ],
          "nextPageToken": "AAAAKgAAAAEAAAAAAAAAA2QJKNtidVgd49TTeNwYcpD+QKT2ynuEbibcQWe2QKrslMGe63gpS0MgZGpcpoKttL4OCXRFn98Xif557it+wSZUsvUDtImjDLvguyuyyFdIZtvIxIKEOPm3k2r4OjAGaFsGOuVbrKljvla7wdU7FYH3OlkNCP8b7PBj9SBkUyGoiAghET74P93AuVIIkdKGtQ=="
          }

       Service API Reference

       Example 4: To list the specified single page of registered domains

       The  following list-domains command example lists the first page REGIS-
       TERED SWF domains that you have registered for your account  using  the
       --maximum-page-size option.

       When  you  make  the  call  again,  this  time  supplying  the value of
       nextPageToken in the --next-page-token  argument,  you'll  get  another
       page of results.

          aws swf list-domains \
              --registration-status REGISTERED \
              --maximum-page-size 1 \
              --next-page-token "AAAAKgAAAAEAAAAAAAAAA2QJKNtidVgd49TTeNwYcpD+QKT2ynuEbibcQWe2QKrslMGe63gpS0MgZGpcpoKttL4OCXRFn98Xif557it+wSZUsvUDtImjDLvguyuyyFdIZtvIxIKEOPm3k2r4OjAGaFsGOuVbrKljvla7wdU7FYH3OlkNCP8b7PBj9SBkUyGoiAghET74P93AuVIIkdKGtQ=="

       Output:

          {
              "domainInfos": [
                  {
                      "status": "REGISTERED",
                      "name": "erontest"
                  }
              ]
          }

       When  there  are no further pages of results to retrieve, nextPageToken
       will not be returned in the results.

OUTPUT
       domainInfos -> (list)
          A list of DomainInfo structures.

          (structure)
              Contains general information about a domain.

              name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the domain. This name is unique within the ac-
                 count.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the domain:

                 o REGISTERED  The domain is properly  registered  and  avail-
                   able.  You  can  use  this domain for registering types and
                   creating new workflow executions.

                 o DEPRECATED  The domain was deprecated  using   DeprecateDo-
                   main , but is still in use. You should not create new work-
                   flow executions in this domain.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the domain provided  through   RegisterDo-
                 main .

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the domain.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          If  a  NextPageToken was returned by a previous call, there are more
          results available. To retrieve the next page of  results,  make  the
          call  again  using  the  returned  token in nextPageToken . Keep all
          other arguments unchanged.

          The configured maximumPageSize determines how many  results  can  be
          returned in a single call.
