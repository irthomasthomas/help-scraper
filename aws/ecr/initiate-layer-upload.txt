INITIATE-LAYER-UPLOAD()                                INITIATE-LAYER-UPLOAD()



NAME
       initiate-layer-upload -

DESCRIPTION
       Notifies Amazon ECR that you intend to upload an image layer.

       When an image is pushed, the InitiateLayerUpload API is called once per
       image layer that has not already been uploaded. Whether or not an image
       layer  has been uploaded is determined by the BatchCheckLayerAvailabil-
       ity API action.

       NOTE:
          This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not  generally
          used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you
          should use the docker CLI to pull, tag, and push images.

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the  registry  to
          which you intend to upload layers. If you do not specify a registry,
          the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository to which you intend to upload layers.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To initiate an image layer upload

       The following initiate-layer-upload example initiates  an  image  layer
       upload to the layer-test repository.

          aws ecr initiate-layer-upload \
              --repository-name layer-test

       Output:

          {
              "partSize": 10485760,
              "uploadId": "6cb64b8a-9378-0e33-2ab1-b780fab8a9e9"
          }

OUTPUT
       uploadId -> (string)
          The upload ID for the layer upload. This parameter is passed to fur-
          ther  UploadLayerPart and  CompleteLayerUpload operations.

       partSize -> (long)
          The size, in bytes, that Amazon ECR expects future  layer  part  up-
          loads to be.
