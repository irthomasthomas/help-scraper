NAME
       describe-repositories -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes image repositories in a registry.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-repositories  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: repositories

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains  the  repositories to be described. If you do not specify a
          registry, the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-names (list)
          A list of repositories to describe. If this  parameter  is  omitted,
          then all repositories in a registry are described.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe the repositories in a registry

       This  example describes the repositories in the default registry for an
       account.

       Command:

          aws ecr describe-repositories

       Output:

          {
              "repositories": [
                  {
                      "registryId": "012345678910",
                      "repositoryName": "ubuntu",
                      "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:012345678910:repository/ubuntu"
                  },
                  {
                      "registryId": "012345678910",
                      "repositoryName": "test",
                      "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:012345678910:repository/test"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       repositories -> (list)
          A list of repository objects corresponding to valid repositories.

          (structure)
              An object representing a repository.

              repositoryArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  identifies  the  reposi-
                 tory. The ARN contains the arn:aws:ecr namespace, followed by
                 the region of the repository, Amazon Web Services account  ID
                 of the repository owner, repository namespace, and repository
                 name.  For  example,  arn:aws:ecr:region:012345678910:reposi-
                 tory-namespace/repository-name .

              registryId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services account ID associated with the reg-
                 istry that contains the repository.

              repositoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the repository.

              repositoryUri -> (string)
                 The URI for the repository. You can use  this  URI  for  con-
                 tainer image push and pull operations.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in JavaScript date format, when the repos-
                 itory was created.

              imageTagMutability -> (string)
                 The tag mutability setting for the repository.

              imageScanningConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The image scanning configuration for a repository.

                 scanOnPush -> (boolean)
                     The setting that determines whether  images  are  scanned
                     after  being pushed to a repository. If set to true , im-
                     ages will be scanned after being pushed. If this  parame-
                     ter is not specified, it will default to false and images
                     will not be scanned unless a  scan  is  manually  started
                     with the API_StartImageScan API.

              encryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  encryption configuration for the repository. This deter-
                 mines how the contents of your repository  are  encrypted  at
                 rest.

                 encryptionType -> (string)
                     The encryption type to use.

                     If  you  use the KMS encryption type, the contents of the
                     repository will be encrypted using server-side encryption
                     with  Key  Management Service key stored in KMS. When you
                     use KMS to encrypt your data, you can either use the  de-
                     fault Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon ECR,
                     or specify your own KMS key, which you already created.

                     If you use the KMS_DSSE encryption type, the contents  of
                     the  repository  will be encrypted with two layers of en-
                     cryption using server-side encryption with the  KMS  Man-
                     agement Service key stored in KMS. Similar to the KMS en-
                     cryption type, you can either use the default Amazon  Web
                     Services  managed KMS key for Amazon ECR, or specify your
                     own KMS key, which you've already created.

                     If you use the AES256 encryption type,  Amazon  ECR  uses
                     server-side  encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption
                     keys which encrypts the images in the repository using an
                     AES256 encryption algorithm.

                     For  more  information, see Amazon ECR encryption at rest
                     in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide .

                 kmsKey -> (string)
                     If you use the KMS encryption type, specify the  KMS  key
                     to  use for encryption. The alias, key ID, or full ARN of
                     the KMS key can be specified. The key must exist  in  the
                     same  Region  as  the repository. If no key is specified,
                     the default Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for  Ama-
                     zon ECR will be used.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken value to include in a future DescribeRepositories re-
          quest. When the results of  a  DescribeRepositories  request  exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of re-
          sults. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
