OPTIONS
       --scan-type (string)
          The scanning type to set for the registry.

          When a registry scanning configuration is not  defined,  by  default
          the  BASIC  scan  type is used. When basic scanning is used, you may
          specify filters to determine which individual repositories,  or  all
          repositories, are scanned when new images are pushed to those repos-
          itories. Alternatively, you can do manual scans of images with basic
          scanning.

          When  the ENHANCED scan type is set, Amazon Inspector provides auto-
          mated vulnerability scanning.  You  may  choose  between  continuous
          scanning  or  scan  on push and you may specify filters to determine
          which individual repositories, or all repositories, are scanned.

          Possible values:

          o BASIC

          o ENHANCED

       --rules (list)
          The scanning rules to use for the registry. A scanning rule is  used
          to determine which repository filters are used and at what frequency
          scanning will occur.

          (structure)
              The details of a scanning rule for a private registry.

              scanFrequency -> (string)
                 The frequency that scans are performed at for a private  reg-
                 istry.  When  the  ENHANCED  scan type is specified, the sup-
                 ported scan frequencies are CONTINUOUS_SCAN and  SCAN_ON_PUSH
                 .  When  the  BASIC  scan type is specified, the SCAN_ON_PUSH
                 scan frequency is supported. If scan on push  is  not  speci-
                 fied, then the MANUAL scan frequency is set by default.

              repositoryFilters -> (list)
                 The  repository filters associated with the scanning configu-
                 ration for a private registry.

                 (structure)
                     The details of a scanning repository filter. For more in-
                     formation on how to use filters, see Using filters in the
                     Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide .

                     filter -> (string)
                        The filter to use when scanning.

                     filterType -> (string)
                        The type associated with the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          scanFrequency=string,repositoryFilters=[{filter=string,filterType=string},{filter=string,filterType=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "scanFrequency": "SCAN_ON_PUSH"|"CONTINUOUS_SCAN"|"MANUAL",
              "repositoryFilters": [
                {
                  "filter": "string",
                  "filterType": "WILDCARD"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
