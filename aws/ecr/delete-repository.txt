DELETE-REPOSITORY()                                        DELETE-REPOSITORY()



NAME
       delete-repository -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  repository.  If the repository isn't empty, you must either
       delete the contents of the repository or use the force option to delete
       the  repository  and have Amazon ECR delete all of its contents on your
       behalf.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains the repository to delete. If you do not specify a registry,
          the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository to delete.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          If true, deleting the repository force deletes the contents  of  the
          repository. If false, the repository must be empty before attempting
          to delete it.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a repository

       The following delete-repository example command force deletes the spec-
       ified  repository  in  the default registry for an account. The --force
       flag is required if the repository contains images.

          aws ecr delete-repository \
              --repository-name ubuntu \
              --force

       Output:

          {
              "repository": {
                  "registryId": "123456789012",
                  "repositoryName": "ubuntu",
                  "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:123456789012:repository/ubuntu"
              }
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       repository -> (structure)
          The repository that was deleted.

          repositoryArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the repository.
              The ARN contains the arn:aws:ecr namespace, followed by the  re-
              gion  of  the  repository, Amazon Web Services account ID of the
              repository owner, repository namespace, and repository name. For
              example,        arn:aws:ecr:region:012345678910:repository-name-
              space/repository-name .

          registryId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the  registry
              that contains the repository.

          repositoryName -> (string)
              The name of the repository.

          repositoryUri -> (string)
              The  URI  for the repository. You can use this URI for container
              image push and pull operations.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in JavaScript date format, when  the  reposi-
              tory was created.

          imageTagMutability -> (string)
              The tag mutability setting for the repository.

          imageScanningConfiguration -> (structure)
              The image scanning configuration for a repository.

              scanOnPush -> (boolean)
                 The  setting that determines whether images are scanned after
                 being pushed to a repository. If set to true , images will be
                 scanned  after  being pushed. If this parameter is not speci-
                 fied, it will default to false and images will not be scanned
                 unless a scan is manually started with the API_StartImageScan
                 API.

          encryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The encryption configuration for the repository. This determines
              how the contents of your repository are encrypted at rest.

              encryptionType -> (string)
                 The encryption type to use.

                 If  you  use  the  KMS  encryption  type, the contents of the
                 repository will be  encrypted  using  server-side  encryption
                 with  Key  Management Service key stored in KMS. When you use
                 KMS to encrypt your data, you can either use the default Ama-
                 zon  Web  Services managed KMS key for Amazon ECR, or specify
                 your own KMS key, which you already created.

                 If you use the KMS_DSSE encryption type, the contents of  the
                 repository  will  be  encrypted with two layers of encryption
                 using server-side encryption with the KMS Management  Service
                 key  stored  in  KMS. Similar to the KMS encryption type, you
                 can either use the default Amazon Web  Services  managed  KMS
                 key for Amazon ECR, or specify your own KMS key, which you've
                 already created.

                 If you use  the  AES256  encryption  type,  Amazon  ECR  uses
                 server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys
                 which encrypts the images in the repository using  an  AES256
                 encryption  algorithm.  For  more information, see Protecting
                 data using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed  en-
                 cryption  keys  (SSE-S3) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service
                 Console Developer Guide .

              kmsKey -> (string)
                 If you use the KMS encryption type, specify the  KMS  key  to
                 use for encryption. The alias, key ID, or full ARN of the KMS
                 key can be specified. The key must exist in the  same  Region
                 as the repository. If no key is specified, the default Amazon
                 Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon ECR will be used.
