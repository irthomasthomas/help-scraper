GET-LOGIN()                                                        GET-LOGIN()



NAME
       get-login -

DESCRIPTION
          Note: This command is deprecated. Use get-login-password instead.

       To log in to an Amazon ECR registry

       This  command retrieves an authentication token using the GetAuthoriza-
       tionToken API, and then it prints a docker login command with  the  au-
       thorization  token  and, if you specified a registry ID, the URI for an
       Amazon ECR registry. You can execute the printed command  to  authenti-
       cate  to  the  registry with Docker. After you have authenticated to an
       Amazon ECR registry with this command, you can use the  Docker  CLI  to
       push  and  pull  images  to  and from that registry as long as your IAM
       principal has access to do so until the token expires.  The  authoriza-
       tion token is valid for 12 hours.

       NOTE:
          This command displays docker login commands to stdout with authenti-
          cation credentials. Your credentials could be visible by other users
          on  your  system  in a process list display or a command history. If
          you are not on a secure system, you should consider  this  risk  and
          login interactively. For more information, see get-authorization-to-
          ken.

OPTIONS
       --registry-ids (string) A list of AWS account IDs  that  correspond  to
       the Amazon ECR registries that you want to log in to.

       --include-email | --no-include-email (boolean) Specify if the '-e' flag
       should be included in the 'docker login' command. The '-e'  option  has
       been  deprecated  and is removed in Docker version 17.06 and later. You
       must specify --no-include-email if you're using Docker version 17.06 or
       later.  The default behavior is to include the '-e' flag in the 'docker
       login' output.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a Docker login command to your default registry

       This example prints a command that you can use to log in  to  your  de-
       fault Amazon ECR registry.

       Command:

          aws ecr get-login

       Output:

          docker login -u AWS -p <password> -e none https://<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com

       To log in to another account's registry

       This  example prints one or more commands that you can use to log in to
       Amazon ECR registries associated with other accounts.

       Command:

          aws ecr get-login --registry-ids 012345678910 023456789012

       Output:

          docker login -u <username> -p <token-1> -e none <endpoint-1>
          docker login -u <username> -p <token-2> -e none <endpoint-2>



                                                                   GET-LOGIN()
