OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

          The registry ID associated with the request.

       scanningConfiguration -> (structure)
          The scanning configuration for the registry.

          scanType -> (string)
              The type of scanning configured for the registry.

          rules -> (list)
              The scanning rules associated with the registry.

              (structure)
                 The details of a scanning rule for a private registry.

                 scanFrequency -> (string)
                     The frequency that scans are performed at for  a  private
                     registry.  When  the ENHANCED scan type is specified, the

                     SCAN_ON_PUSH . When the BASIC scan type is specified, the
                     SCAN_ON_PUSH scan frequency is supported. If scan on push
                     is  not  specified, then the MANUAL scan frequency is set
