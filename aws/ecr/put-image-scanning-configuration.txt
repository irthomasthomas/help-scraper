DESCRIPTION
       WARNING:
          The  PutImageScanningConfiguration API is being deprecated, in favor
          of specifying the  image  scanning  configuration  at  the  registry
          level. For more information, see  PutRegistryScanningConfiguration .

       Updates the image scanning configuration for the specified repository.

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains the repository in which to update the image  scanning  con-
          figuration  setting.  If  you do not specify a registry, the default
          registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository in which to  update  the  image  scanning
          configuration setting.

       --image-scanning-configuration (structure)
          The  image  scanning  configuration for the repository. This setting
          determines whether images are scanned for known vulnerabilities  af-
          ter being pushed to the repository.

          scanOnPush -> (boolean)
              The setting that determines whether images are scanned after be-
              ing pushed to a repository. If set to  true  ,  images  will  be
              scanned  after being pushed. If this parameter is not specified,
              it will default to false and images will not be scanned unless a
              scan is manually started with the API_StartImageScan API.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          scanOnPush=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "scanOnPush": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update the image scanning configuration for a repository

       The  following put-image-scanning-configuration example updates the im-
       age scanning configuration for the specified repository.

          aws ecr put-image-scanning-configuration \
              --repository-name sample-repo \
              --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true

       Output:

          {
             "registryId": "012345678910",
             "repositoryName": "sample-repo",
             "imageScanningConfiguration": {
               "scanOnPush": true
             }
          }

       For more information, see Image Scanning in the Amazon ECR User Guide.

OUTPUT
       registryId -> (string)
          The registry ID associated with the request.

       repositoryName -> (string)

       imageScanningConfiguration -> (structure)
          The image scanning configuration setting for the repository.

          scanOnPush -> (boolean)
              The setting that determines whether images are scanned after be-
              ing  pushed  to  a  repository.  If set to true , images will be
