BATCH-DELETE-IMAGE()                                      BATCH-DELETE-IMAGE()



NAME
       batch-delete-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  list  of  specified  images within a repository. Images are
       specified with either an imageTag or imageDigest .

       You can remove a tag from an image by specifying  the  image's  tag  in
       your  request. When you remove the last tag from an image, the image is
       deleted from your repository.

       You can completely delete an image (and all of its tags) by  specifying
       the image's digest in your request.

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains the image to delete. If you do not specify a registry,  the
          default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The repository that contains the image to delete.

       --image-ids (list)
          A  list  of image ID references that correspond to images to delete.
          The format of the imageIds reference  is  imageTag=tag  or  imageDi-
          gest=digest .

          (structure)
              An object with identifying information for an image in an Amazon
              ECR repository.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "imageDigest": "string",
              "imageTag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To delete an image

       The following batch-delete-image example deletes an image with the  tag
       precise  in the specified repository in the default registry for an ac-
       count.

          aws ecr batch-delete-image \
              --repository-name ubuntu \
              --image-ids imageTag=precise

       Output:

          {
              "failures": [],
              "imageIds": [
                  {

          }

       Example 2: To delete multiple images

       The following batch-delete-image example deletes all images tagged with
       prod and team1 in the specified repository.

              --repository-name MyRepository \
              --image-ids imageTag=prod imageTag=team1

       Output:

          {
              "imageIds": [
                  {
                      "imageDigest": "sha256:123456789012",
                      "imageTag": "prod"
                  },
