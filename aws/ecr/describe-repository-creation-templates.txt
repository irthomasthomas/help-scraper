NAME
       describe-repository-creation-templates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  details about the repository creation templates in a registry.
       The prefixes request parameter can be used to return the details for  a
       specific repository creation template.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-repository-creation-templates is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate ar-
       gument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a  pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: repositoryCreationTemplates

OPTIONS
       --prefixes (list)
          The repository namespace prefixes  associated  with  the  repository
          creation  templates to describe. If this value is not specified, all
          repository creation templates are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       registryId -> (string)
          The registry ID associated with the request.

       repositoryCreationTemplates -> (list)
          The details of the repository creation templates.

          (structure)
              The  details of the repository creation template associated with
              the request.

              prefix -> (string)
                 The repository namespace prefix associated with  the  reposi-
                 tory creation template.

              description -> (string)
                 The  description associated with the repository creation tem-
                 plate.

              encryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The encryption configuration associated with  the  repository
                 creation template.

                 encryptionType -> (string)
                     The encryption type to use.

                     If  you  use the KMS encryption type, the contents of the
                     repository will be encrypted using server-side encryption
                     with  Key  Management Service key stored in KMS. When you
                     use KMS to encrypt your data, you can either use the  de-
                     fault Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon ECR,
                     or specify your own KMS key, which you  already  created.
                     For   more   information,   see   Protecting  data  using
                     server-side encryption with an KMS key stored in Key Man-
                     agement  Service  (SSE-KMS)  in the Amazon Simple Storage
                     Service Console Developer Guide .

                     If you use the AES256 encryption type,  Amazon  ECR  uses
                     server-side  encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption
                     keys which encrypts the images in the repository using an
                     AES256  encryption  algorithm.  For more information, see
                     Protecting data using server-side encryption with  Amazon
                     S3-managed  encryption keys (SSE-S3) in the Amazon Simple
                     Storage Service Console Developer Guide .

                 kmsKey -> (string)
                     If you use the KMS encryption type, specify the  KMS  key
                     to  use  for encryption. The full ARN of the KMS key must
                     be specified. The key must exist in the  same  Region  as
                     the  repository. If no key is specified, the default Ama-
                     zon Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon ECR  will  be
                     used.

              resourceTags -> (list)
                 The  metadata  to apply to the repository to help you catego-
                 rize and organize. Each tag consists of a key and an optional
                 value,  both of which you define. Tag keys can have a maximum
                 character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a
                 maximum length of 256 characters.

                 (structure)
                     The  metadata  to apply to a resource to help you catego-
                     rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and  a
                     value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a max-
                     imum character length of 128 characters, and  tag  values
                     can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

                     Key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key
                        is a general label that acts like a category for  more
                        specific tag values.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A  value  acts  as  a descriptor within a tag category
                        (key).

              imageTagMutability -> (string)
                 The tag mutability setting for the repository. If this param-
                 eter  is omitted, the default setting of MUTABLE will be used
                 which will allow image tags to be overwritten.  If  IMMUTABLE
                 is  specified,  all  image tags within the repository will be
                 immutable which will prevent them from being overwritten.

              repositoryPolicy -> (string)
                 he repository policy to apply to repositories  created  using
                 the template. A repository policy is a permissions policy as-
                 sociated with a repository to control access permissions.

              lifecyclePolicy -> (string)
                 The lifecycle policy to use for  repositories  created  using
                 the template.

              appliedFor -> (list)
                 A list of enumerable Strings representing the repository cre-
                 ation scenarios that this template will  apply  towards.  The
                 two  supported  scenarios are PULL_THROUGH_CACHE and REPLICA-
                 TION

                 (string)

              customRoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the role to be assumed by Amazon ECR.  Amazon  ECR
                 will  assume  your  supplied  role  when the customRoleArn is
                 specified. When this field isn't specified, Amazon  ECR  will
                 use  the service-linked role for the repository creation tem-
                 plate.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in JavaScript date format, when the repos-
                 itory creation template was created.

              updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in JavaScript date format, when the repos-
                 itory creation template was last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in  a  future  DescribeRepositoryCre-
          ationTemplates request. When the results of a DescribeRepositoryCre-
          ationTemplates request exceed maxResults , this value can be used to
          retrieve the next page of results. This value is null when there are
          no more results to return.
