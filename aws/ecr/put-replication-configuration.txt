PUT-REPLICATION-CONFIGURATION()                PUT-REPLICATION-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-replication-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  the replication configuration for a registry. The
       existing replication configuration for a repository  can  be  retrieved
       with  the   DescribeRegistry API action. The first time the PutReplica-
       tionConfiguration API is called, a service-linked IAM role  is  created
       in  your account for the replication process. For more information, see
       Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECR in the  Amazon  Elastic  Con-
       tainer Registry User Guide .

       NOTE:
          When  configuring cross-account replication, the destination account
          must grant the source account permission to replicate. This  permis-
          sion is controlled using a registry permissions policy. For more in-
          formation, see  PutRegistryPolicy .

OPTIONS
       --replication-configuration (structure)
          An object representing the replication configuration for a registry.

          rules -> (list)
              An array of objects representing  the  replication  destinations
              and repository filters for a replication configuration.

              (structure)
                 An array of objects representing the replication destinations
                 and repository filters for a replication configuration.

                 destinations -> (list)
                     An array of objects representing the  destination  for  a
                     replication rule.

                     (structure)
                        An array of objects representing the destination for a
                        replication rule.

                        region -> (string)
                            The Region to replicate to.

                        registryId -> (string)
                            The Amazon Web Services account ID of  the  Amazon
                            ECR private registry to replicate to. When config-
                            uring cross-Region  replication  within  your  own
                            registry, specify your own account ID.

                 repositoryFilters -> (list)
                     An array of objects representing the filters for a repli-
                     cation rule. Specifying a repository filter for a  repli-
                     cation  rule  provides  a  method  for  controlling which
                     repositories in a private registry are replicated.

                     (structure)
                        The filter settings used with image replication. Spec-
                        ifying  a repository filter to a replication rule pro-
                        vides a method for controlling which repositories in a
                        private  registry  are  replicated.  If no filters are
                        added, the contents of  all  repositories  are  repli-
                        cated.

                        filter -> (string)
                            The  repository  filter  details.  When  the  PRE-
                            FIX_MATCH filter type is specified, this value  is
                            required  and should be the repository name prefix
                            to configure replication for.

                        filterType -> (string)
                            The repository filter  type.  The  only  supported
                            value is PREFIX_MATCH , which is a repository name
                            prefix specified with the filter parameter.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "rules": [
              {
                "destinations": [
                  {
                    "region": "string",
                    "registryId": "string"
                  }
                  ...
                ],
                "repositoryFilters": [
                  {
                    "filter": "string",
                    "filterType": "PREFIX_MATCH"
                  }
                  ...
                ]
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
