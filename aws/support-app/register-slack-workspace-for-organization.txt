NAME
       register-slack-workspace-for-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  a  Slack  workspace for your Amazon Web Services account. To
       call this API, your account must be part of an organization in  Organi-
       zations.

       If  you're  the  management  account  and  you  want  to register Slack
       workspaces for your  organization,  you  must  complete  the  following
       tasks:

       o Sign  in  to the Amazon Web Services Support Center and authorize the
         Slack workspaces where you want your organization to have access  to.
         See  Authorize  a  Slack workspace in the Amazon Web Services Support
         User Guide .

       o Call the RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization API to authorize  each
         Slack workspace for the organization.

       After the management account authorizes the Slack workspace, member ac-
       counts can call this API to authorize  the  same  Slack  workspace  for
       their  individual accounts. Member accounts don't need to authorize the
       Slack workspace manually through the Amazon Web Services Support Center
       .

       To use the Amazon Web Services Support App, each account must then com-
       plete the following tasks:

       o Create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the required
         permission.  For  more information, see Managing access to the Amazon
         Web Services Support App .

       o Configure a Slack channel to use the Amazon Web Services Support  App
         for  support  cases  for  that  account.  For  more  information, see
         Configuring a Slack channel .

OPTIONS
       --team-id (string)
          The team ID in Slack. This ID uniquely identifies a Slack workspace,
          such  as  T012ABCDEFG . Specify the Slack workspace that you want to
          use for your organization.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       seconds.
