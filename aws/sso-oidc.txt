NAME
       sso-oidc -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web Services Single Sign On OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web ser-
       vice that enables a client (such as Amazon Web Services CLI or a native
       application) to register with Amazon Web Services SSO. The service also
       enables the client to fetch the users access token upon successful  au-
       thentication and authorization with Amazon Web Services SSO.

       NOTE:
              Although Amazon Web Services Single Sign-On was renamed, the sso
              and identitystore API namespaces will continue to  retain  their
              original  name for backward compatibility purposes. For more in-
              formation, see Amazon Web Services SSO rename .

          Considerations for Using This Guide

       Before you begin using this guide, we recommend that you  first  review
       the  following  important information about how the Amazon Web Services
       SSO OIDC service works.

       o The Amazon Web Services SSO OIDC service  currently  implements  only
         the  portions of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant standard (-
         https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628 ) that are  necessary  to  enable
         single  sign-on  authentication  with  the AWS CLI. Support for other
         OIDC flows frequently needed for native applications, such as  Autho-
         rization Code Flow (+ PKCE), will be addressed in future releases.

       o The  service emits only OIDC access tokens, such that obtaining a new
         token (For example, token refresh) requires explicit user  re-authen-
         tication.

       o The  access  tokens  provided by this service grant access to all AWS
         account entitlements assigned to an Amazon Web Services SSO user, not
         just a particular application.

       o The  documentation  in  this guide does not describe the mechanism to
         convert the access token into AWS Auth (sigv4)  credentials  for  use
         with  IAM-protected  AWS service endpoints. For more information, see
         GetRoleCredentials in the Amazon Web Services SSO Portal  API  Refer-
         ence Guide .

       For general information about Amazon Web Services SSO, see What is Ama-
       zon Web Services SSO? in the Amazon Web Services SSO User Guide .
