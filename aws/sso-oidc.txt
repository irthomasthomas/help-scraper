SSO-OIDC()                                                          SSO-OIDC()



NAME
       sso-oidc -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  IAM  Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) OpenID Con-
       nect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as AWS CLI  or
       a native application) to register with IAM Identity Center. The service
       also enables the client to fetch the users access token upon successful
       authentication and authorization with IAM Identity Center.

       NOTE:
              Although  AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the sso and identitys-
              tore API namespaces will continue to retain their original  name
              for  backward  compatibility purposes. For more information, see
              IAM Identity Center rename .

          Considerations for Using This Guide

       Before you begin using this guide, we recommend that you  first  review
       the  following  important information about how the IAM Identity Center
       OIDC service works.

       o The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently  implements  only  the
         portions  of  the  OAuth  2.0  Device Authorization Grant standard (-
         https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628 ) that are  necessary  to  enable
         single  sign-on  authentication  with  the AWS CLI. Support for other
         OIDC flows frequently needed for native applications, such as  Autho-
         rization Code Flow (+ PKCE), will be addressed in future releases.

       o The  service emits only OIDC access tokens, such that obtaining a new
         token (For example, token refresh) requires explicit user  re-authen-
         tication.

       o The  access  tokens  provided by this service grant access to all AWS
         account entitlements assigned to an IAM  Identity  Center  user,  not
         just a particular application.

       o The  documentation  in  this guide does not describe the mechanism to
         convert the access token into AWS Auth (sigv4)  credentials  for  use
         with  IAM-protected  AWS service endpoints. For more information, see
         GetRoleCredentials in the IAM Identity Center  Portal  API  Reference
         Guide .

       For  general  information  about  IAM  Identity Center, see What is IAM
       Identity Center? in the IAM Identity Center User Guide .
