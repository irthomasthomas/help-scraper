IMPORT-VM-IMAGE()                                            IMPORT-VM-IMAGE()



NAME
       import-vm-image -

DESCRIPTION
       When you export your virtual machine (VM) from its virtualization envi-
       ronment, that process creates a set of one or more disk container files
       that  act as snapshots of your VMs environment, settings, and data. The
       Amazon EC2 API ImportImage action uses those files to  import  your  VM
       and create an AMI. To import using the CLI command, see import-image

       You  can  reference  the  task ID from the VM import to pull in the AMI
       that the import created as  the  base  image  for  your  Image  Builder
       recipe.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the base image that is created by the import process.

       --semantic-version (string)
          The  semantic  version  to attach to the base image that was created
          during the import process. This version follows the semantic version
          syntax.

          NOTE:
              The    semantic    version    has   four   nodes:   <major>.<mi-
              nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three,
              and can filter on all of them.
                 Assignment: For the first three nodes you can assign any pos-
                 itive integer value, including zero, with an upper  limit  of
                 2^30-1,  or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automati-
                 cally assigns the build number to the fourth node.

                 Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the
                 assignment  requirements  for  the nodes that you can assign.
                 For example, you might choose  a  software  version  pattern,
                 such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

       --description (string)
          The  description  for  the  base image that is created by the import
          process.

       --platform (string)
          The operating system platform for the imported VM.

          Possible values:

          o Windows

          o Linux

       --os-version (string)
          The operating system version for the imported VM.

       --vm-import-task-id (string)
          The importTaskId (API) or ImportTaskId (CLI) from the Amazon EC2  VM
          import  process. Image Builder retrieves information from the import
          process to pull in the AMI that is created from the VM source as the
          base image for your recipe.

       --tags (map)
          Tags that are attached to the import resources.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency
          of the request. For more information, see  Ensuring  idempotency  in
          the Amazon EC2 API Reference .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.
