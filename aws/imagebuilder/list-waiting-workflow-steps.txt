OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  nextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       steps -> (list)
          An array of the workflow steps that are waiting for action  in  your
          Amazon Web Services account.

          (structure)
              Contains  runtime details for an instance of a workflow that ran
              for the associated image build version.

              stepExecutionId -> (string)
                 Uniquely identifies the workflow step that ran for the  asso-
                 ciated image build version.

              imageBuildVersionArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the image build version
                 that ran the workflow.

              workflowExecutionId -> (string)
                 Uniquely identifies the runtime instance of the workflow that
                 contains  the workflow step that ran for the associated image
                 build version.

              workflowBuildVersionArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the workflow resource that ran.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the workflow step.

              action -> (string)
                 The name of the step action.

              startTime -> (string)
                 The timestamp when the workflow step started.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The next token used for paginated responses. When this  field  isn't
          empty,  there  are  additional  elements that the service hasn't in-
          cluded in this request. Use this token with the next request to  re-
          trieve additional objects.
