OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  nextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --image-build-version-arn (string)
          List  all  workflow  runtime instances for the specified image build
          version resource ARN.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       workflowExecutions -> (list)
          Contains an array of runtime details that  represents  each  time  a
          workflow ran for the requested image build version.

          (structure)
              Metadata  that includes details and status from this runtime in-
              stance of the workflow.

              workflowBuildVersionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the workflow resource build
                 version that ran.

              workflowExecutionId -> (string)
                 Unique identifier that Image Builder assigns to keep track of
                 runtime resources each time it runs a workflow.

              type -> (string)
                 Indicates what type of workflow that Image  Builder  ran  for
                 this runtime instance of the workflow.

              status -> (string)
                 The current runtime status for this workflow.

              message -> (string)
                 The runtime output message from the workflow, if applicable.

              totalStepCount -> (integer)
                 The  total number of steps in the workflow. This should equal
                 the sum of the step counts for  steps  that  succeeded,  were
                 skipped, and failed.

              totalStepsSucceeded -> (integer)
                 A  runtime count for the number of steps in the workflow that
                 ran successfully.

              totalStepsFailed -> (integer)
                 A runtime count for the number of steps in the workflow  that
                 failed.

              totalStepsSkipped -> (integer)
                 A  runtime count for the number of steps in the workflow that
                 were skipped.

              startTime -> (string)
                 The timestamp when the  runtime  instance  of  this  workflow
                 started.

              endTime -> (string)
                 The timestamp when this runtime instance of the workflow fin-
                 ished.

              parallelGroup -> (string)
                 The name of the test group that included  the  test  workflow
                 resource at runtime.

       imageBuildVersionArn -> (string)
          The  resource ARN of the image build version for which you requested
          a list of workflow runtime details.

       message -> (string)
          The output message from the list action, if applicable.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The next token used for paginated responses. When this  field  isn't
          empty,  there  are  additional  elements that the service hasn't in-
          cluded in this request. Use this token with the next request to  re-
          trieve additional objects.
