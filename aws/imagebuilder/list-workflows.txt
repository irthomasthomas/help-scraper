OPTIONS
       --owner (string)
          Used  to  get a list of workflow build version filtered by the iden-
          tity of the creator.

          Possible values:

          o Self

          o Shared

          o Amazon

          o ThirdParty

       --filters (list)
          Used to streamline search results.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific list of results from a list operation. Filters can be used
              to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as  tags,
              attributes, or IDs.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --by-name | --no-by-name (boolean)
          Specify all or part of the workflow name to streamline results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the nextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       workflowVersionList -> (list)
          A list of workflow build versions that match the request criteria.

          (structure)
              Contains details about this version of the workflow.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the workflow resource.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the workflow.

              version -> (string)
                 The semantic version of the workflow resource. The format in-
                 cludes three nodes: <major>.<minor>.<patch>.

              description -> (string)
                 Describes the workflow.

              type -> (string)
                 The image creation stage that this workflow applies to. Image
                 Builder currently supports build and test stage workflows.

              owner -> (string)
                 The owner of the workflow resource.

              dateCreated -> (string)
                 The  timestamp  when  Image Builder created the workflow ver-
                 sion.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The next token used for paginated responses. When this  field  isn't
          empty,  there  are  additional  elements that the service hasn't in-
          cluded in this request. Use this token with the next request to  re-
          trieve additional objects.
