OPTIONS
       --lifecycle-policy-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image lifecycle pol-
          icy resource to get.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     includeResources -> (structure)
                        Specifies  the resources that the lifecycle policy ap-
                        plies to.

                        amis -> (boolean)
                            Specifies whether the lifecycle action should  ap-
                            ply to distributed AMIs.

                     type -> (string)
                        Filter resources based on either age or count .

                     value -> (integer)
                        The number of units for the time  period  or  for  the
                        count.  For  example,  a value of 6 might refer to six
                        months or six AMIs.

                        NOTE:
                            For count-based filters, this value represents the
                            minimum  number  of  resources to keep on hand. If
                            you have fewer resources than this number, the re-
                            source is excluded from lifecycle actions.

                     unit -> (string)
                        Defines  the  unit  of  time that the lifecycle policy
                        uses to determine impacted resources. This is required
                        for age-based rules.

                     retainAtLeast -> (integer)
                        For age-based filters, this is the number of resources
                        to keep on hand after the lifecycle DELETE  action  is
                        applied.  Impacted  resources  are only deleted if you
                        have more than this number of resources. If  you  have
                        fewer  resources  than  this  number, the impacted re-
                        source is not deleted.

                 exclusionRules -> (structure)
                     Additional rules to specify resources that should be  ex-
                     empt from policy actions.

                     tagMap -> (map)
                        Contains  a  list  of  tags that Image Builder uses to
                        skip lifecycle actions for resources that have them.

                        Lists configuration values that apply to AMIs that Im-
                        age Builder should exclude from the lifecycle action.

                        isPublic -> (boolean)
                            Configures  whether  public AMIs are excluded from
                            the lifecycle action.

                        regions -> (list)
                            Configures Amazon Web Services  Regions  that  are

                               policy uses to calculate elapsed time since the

                     Specifies an Image Builder recipe that the lifecycle pol-
                     icy uses for resource selection.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of an Image Builder recipe that the lifecycle
