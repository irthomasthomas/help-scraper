OPTIONS
       --workflow-execution-id (string)
          Use the unique identifier for a runtime instance of the workflow  to
          get runtime details.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       workflowBuildVersionArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the build version for the Image
          Builder workflow resource that defines  the  specified  runtime  in-
          stance of the workflow.

       workflowExecutionId -> (string)
          The  unique  identifier that Image Builder assigned to keep track of
          runtime details when it ran the workflow.

       imageBuildVersionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image resource  build  version
          that the specified runtime instance of the workflow created.

       type -> (string)
          The  type  of workflow that Image Builder ran for the specified run-
          time instance of the workflow.

       status -> (string)
          The current runtime status for the specified runtime instance of the
          workflow.

       message -> (string)
          The  output message from the specified runtime instance of the work-
          flow, if applicable.

       totalStepCount -> (integer)
          The total number of steps in the specified runtime instance  of  the
          workflow  that  ran.  This  number  should equal the sum of the step
          counts for steps that succeeded, were skipped, and failed.

       totalStepsSucceeded -> (integer)
          A runtime count for the number of steps that ran successfully in the
          specified runtime instance of the workflow.

       totalStepsFailed -> (integer)
          A runtime count for the number of steps that failed in the specified
          runtime instance of the workflow.

       totalStepsSkipped -> (integer)
          A runtime count for the number of steps that  were  skipped  in  the
          specified runtime instance of the workflow.

       startTime -> (string)
          The  timestamp  when  the specified runtime instance of the workflow
          started.

       endTime -> (string)
          The timestamp when the specified runtime instance  of  the  workflow
          finished.

       parallelGroup -> (string)
          Test workflows are defined within named runtime groups. The parallel
          group is a named group that contains one or more test workflows.
