OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An  array  of  name  value pairs that you can use to filter your re-
          sults. You can use the following filters to streamline results:

          o imageBuildVersionArn

          o imagePipelineArn

          o vulnerabilityId

          o severity

          If you don't request a filter, then all findings in your account are
          listed.

          (structure)
              A  name  value pair that Image Builder applies to streamline re-
              sults from the vulnerability scan findings list action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the image scan finding filter. Filter  names  are
                 case-sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

                     (structure)
                        Amazon Inspector generates a risk score for each find-
                        ing. This score helps you to prioritize  findings,  to
                        focus  on the most critical findings and the most vul-
                        nerable resources. The score uses the Common  Vulnera-
                        bility  Scoring System (CVSS) format. This format is a
                        modification of the base CVSS score that the  National
                        Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides. For more infor-
                        mation about severity levels, see Severity levels  for
