CREATE-COMPONENT()                                          CREATE-COMPONENT()



NAME
       create-component -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new component that can be used to build, validate, test, and
       assess your image. The component is based on a YAML document  that  you
       specify using exactly one of the following methods:

       o Inline, using the data property in the request body.

       o A  URL that points to a YAML document file stored in Amazon S3, using
         the uri property in the request body.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the component.

       --semantic-version (string)
          The semantic version of the component. This version follows the  se-
          mantic version syntax.

          NOTE:
              The    semantic    version    has   four   nodes:   <major>.<mi-
              nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three,
              and can filter on all of them.
                 Assignment: For the first three nodes you can assign any pos-
                 itive integer value, including zero, with an upper  limit  of
                 2^30-1,  or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automati-
                 cally assigns the build number to the fourth node.

                 Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the
                 assignment  requirements  for  the nodes that you can assign.
                 For example, you might choose  a  software  version  pattern,
                 such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

       --description (string)
          Describes the contents of the component.

       --change-description (string)
          The  change  description of the component. Describes what change has
          been made in this version, or what makes this version different from
          other versions of this component.

       --platform (string)
          The operating system platform of the component.

          Possible values:

          o Windows

          o Linux

       --supported-os-versions (list)
          The operating system (OS) version supported by the component. If the
          OS information is available, a prefix match is performed against the
          base image OS version during image recipe creation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --data (string)
          Component  data contains inline YAML document content for the compo-
          nent. Alternatively, you can specify the uri of a YAML document file
          stored in Amazon S3. However, you cannot specify both properties.

       --uri (string)
          The  uri  of  a YAML component document file. This must be an S3 URL
          (s3://bucket/key ), and the requester must have permission to access
          the  S3  bucket  it points to. If you use Amazon S3, you can specify
          component content up to your service quota.

          Alternatively, you can specify the YAML document inline,  using  the
          component data property. You cannot specify both properties.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the KMS key that is used to encrypt this component.

       --tags (map)
          The tags that apply to the component.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token of the component.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a component

       The  following create-component example creates a component that uses a
       JSON document file and references a component document in  YAML  format
       that is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket.

          aws imagebuilder create-component \
              --cli-input-json file://create-component.json

       Contents of create-component.json:

          {
              "name": "MyExampleComponent",
              "semanticVersion": "2019.12.02",
              "description": "An example component that builds, validates and tests an image",
              "changeDescription": "Initial version.",
              "platform": "Windows",
              "uri": "s3://s3-bucket-name/s3-bucket-path/component.yaml"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "clientToken": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
              "componentBuildVersionArn": "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:component/examplecomponent/2019.12.02/1"
          }

       Image Pipeline Using the AWS CLI in the EC2 Image Builder Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency token used to make this request idempotent.

       componentBuildVersionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the component  that  this  request
