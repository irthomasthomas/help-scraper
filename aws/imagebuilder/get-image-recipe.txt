OPTIONS
       --image-recipe-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image recipe that you want to
          retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

          additionalInstanceConfiguration -> (structure)
              Before you create a new AMI, Image  Builder  launches  temporary
              Amazon EC2 instances to build and test your image configuration.
              Instance configuration adds a layer of control  over  those  in-
              stances.  You can define settings and add scripts to run when an
              instance is launched from your AMI.

              systemsManagerAgent -> (structure)
                 Contains settings for the Systems Manager agent on your build
                 instance.

                 uninstallAfterBuild -> (boolean)
                     Controls  whether  the  Systems  Manager agent is removed
                     from your final build image, prior to  creating  the  new
                     AMI.  If  this  is set to true, then the agent is removed
                     from the final image. If it's  set  to  false,  then  the
                     agent  is left in, so that it is included in the new AMI.
                     The default value is false.

              userDataOverride -> (string)
                 Use this property to provide commands or a command script  to
                 run when you launch your build instance.

                 The  userDataOverride property replaces any commands that Im-
                 age Builder might have added to ensure that  Systems  Manager
                 is  installed  on  your Linux build instance. If you override
                 the user data, make sure that you  add  commands  to  install
                 Systems  Manager, if it is not pre-installed on your base im-
                 age.

                 NOTE:
                     The user data is always base 64 encoded. For example, the
                     following commands are encoded as IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKbWtkaX-
