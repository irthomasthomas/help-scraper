OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Use the following filters to streamline results:

          o description

          o distributionConfigurationArn

          o imageRecipeArn

          o infrastructureConfigurationArn

          o name

          o status

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a list operation. Filters can be used
              to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags,
              attributes, or IDs.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  nextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 ated, including the operating system (OS) version and package
                 list. This information is used to enhance the overall experi-
                 ence of using EC2 Image Builder. Enabled by default.

              imageRecipeArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image recipe associated
                 with this image pipeline.

                     Determines if tests should run after building the  image.
                     Image  Builder  defaults to enable tests to run following
                     the image build, before image distribution.

                 timeoutMinutes -> (integer)
                     The maximum time in minutes that tests are  permitted  to

                 scheduleExpression -> (string)
                     The  cron  expression  determines  how  often  EC2  Image
                     Builder evaluates your pipelineExecutionStartCondition .

                     For information on how to format a cron expression in Im-
                     age Builder,  see  Use  cron  expressions  in  EC2  Image
                     Builder .

                 timezone -> (string)
                     The  timezone  that applies to the scheduling expression.
                     For example, "Etc/UTC", "America/Los_Angeles" in the IANA
                     timezone format . If not specified this defaults to UTC.

                 pipelineExecutionStartCondition -> (string)
                     The condition configures when the pipeline should trigger
                     a new image build. When the  pipelineExecutionStartCondi-
                     tion   is   set   to  EXPRESSION_MATCH_AND_DEPENDENCY_UP-
                     DATES_AVAILABLE , and you use semantic version filters on
                     the  base  image  or components in your image recipe, EC2
                     Image Builder will build a new image only when there  are
                     new  versions  of  the image or components in your recipe
                     that match the semantic version filter. When it is set to
                     EXPRESSION_MATCH_ONLY  ,  it will build a new image every
                     time the CRON expression matches the  current  time.  For
                     semantic  version  syntax, see CreateComponent in the EC2
                     Image Builder API Reference .

                               (string)

                     parallelGroup -> (string)
                        Test workflows are defined within named runtime groups
                        called parallel groups.  The  parallel  group  is  the
                        named  group  that  contains  this test workflow. Test
                        workflows within a parallel group can run at the  same
                        time.  Image  Builder starts up to five test workflows
                        in the group at the same time, and  starts  additional
                        workflows  as  others complete, until all workflows in
                        the group have completed. This field only applies  for
                        test workflows.

                     onFailure -> (string)
                        The action to take if the workflow fails.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  next  token used for paginated responses. When this field isn't
          empty, there are additional elements that  the  service  hasn't  in-
          cluded  in this request. Use this token with the next request to re-
          trieve additional objects.
