OPTIONS
       --owner (string)
          The  owner  defines  which images you want to list. By default, this
          request will only show images owned by your  account.  You  can  use
          this  field to specify if you want to view images owned by yourself,
          by Amazon, or those images that have been shared with you  by  other
          customers.

          Possible values:

          o Self

          o Shared

          o Amazon

          o ThirdParty

       --filters (list)
          Use the following filters to streamline results:

          o name

          o osVersion

          o platform

          o type

          o version

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a list operation. Filters can be used
              to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags,
              attributes, or IDs.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --by-name | --no-by-name (boolean)
          Requests a list of images with a specific recipe name.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  nextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated (boolean)
          Includes deprecated images in the response list.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       imageVersionList -> (list)
          The list of image semantic versions.

          NOTE:
              The   semantic   version   has    four    nodes:    <major>.<mi-
              nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three,
              and can filter on all of them.
                 Filtering: With semantic versioning, you have the flexibility
                 to  use  wildcards (x) to specify the most recent versions or
                 nodes when selecting the base image or  components  for  your
                 recipe. When you use a wildcard in any node, all nodes to the
                 right of the first wildcard must also be wildcards.

          (structure)
              The defining characteristics of a specific version of  an  Image
              Builder image.

              arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a specific version of an
                 Image Builder image.

                 NOTE:
                     Semantic versioning is included in each  object's  Amazon
                     Resource  Name  (ARN),  at the level that applies to that
                     object as follows:

                     o Versionless ARNs and Name ARNs do not include  specific
                       values  in  any of the nodes. The nodes are either left
                       off entirely, or they are specified as  wildcards,  for
                       example: x.x.x.

                     o Version  ARNs  have  only  the  first three nodes: <ma-
                       jor>.<minor>.<patch>

                     o Build version ARNs have all four nodes, and point to  a
                       specific build for a specific version of an object.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of this specific version of an Image Builder image.

              type -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  this image produces an AMI or a container
                 image.

              version -> (string)
                 Details for a specific version of  an  Image  Builder  image.
                 This version follows the semantic version syntax.

                 NOTE:
                     The   semantic   version  has  four  nodes:  <major>.<mi-
                     nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first
                     three, and can filter on all of them.
                        Assignment:  For  the first three nodes you can assign
                        any positive integer value, including  zero,  with  an
                        upper  limit  of  2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node.
                        Image Builder automatically assigns the  build  number
                        to the fourth node.

                        Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres
                        to the assignment requirements for the nodes that  you
                        can  assign.  For example, you might choose a software
                        version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or  a  date,  such  as
                        2021.01.01.

                        Filtering:  With  semantic  versioning,  you  have the
                        flexibility to use wildcards (x) to specify  the  most
                        recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image
                        or components for your recipe. When you use a wildcard
                        in any node, all nodes to the right of the first wild-
                        card must also be wildcards.

              platform -> (string)
                 The operating system platform of the image version, for exam-
                 ple "Windows" or "Linux".

              osVersion -> (string)
                 The  operating  system  version  of  the Amazon EC2 build in-
                 stance. For example, Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu 18, or  Microsoft
                 Windows Server 2019.

              owner -> (string)
                 The owner of the image version.

              dateCreated -> (string)
                 The  date on which this specific version of the Image Builder
                 image was created.

              buildType -> (string)
                 Indicates the type of build  that  created  this  image.  The
                 build can be initiated in the following ways:

                 o USER_INITIATED  A manual pipeline build request.

                 o SCHEDULED   A pipeline build initiated by a cron expression
                   in the Image Builder pipeline, or from EventBridge.

                 o IMPORT  A VM import created the image to use  as  the  base
                   image for the recipe.

              imageSource -> (string)
                 The origin of the base image that Image Builder used to build
                 this image.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The next token used for paginated responses. When this  field  isn't
          empty,  there  are  additional  elements that the service hasn't in-
          cluded in this request. Use this token with the next request to  re-
          trieve additional objects.
