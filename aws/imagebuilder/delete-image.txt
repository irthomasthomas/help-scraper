NAME
       delete-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an  Image Builder image resource. This does not delete any EC2
       AMIs or ECR container images that are created during  the  image  build
       process. You must clean those up separately, using the appropriate Ama-
       zon EC2 or Amazon ECR console actions, or API or CLI commands.

       o To deregister an EC2 Linux AMI, see Deregister your Linux AMI in  the
         * Amazon EC2 User Guide * .

       o To  deregister an EC2 Windows AMI, see Deregister your Windows AMI in
         the * Amazon EC2 Windows Guide * .

       o To delete a container image from Amazon ECR, see Deleting an image in
         the Amazon ECR User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --image-build-version-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Image Builder image resource
          to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete an image

       The  following  delete-image  example deletes an image build version by
       specifying its ARN.

          aws imagebuilder delete-image \
              --image-build-version-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image/my-example-image/2019.12.02/1

       Output:

          {
              "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "imageBuildVersionArn": "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image/mybasicrecipe/2019.12.03/1"
          }

       For more information, see Setting Up and Managing an EC2 Image  Builder
       Image Pipeline Using the AWS CLI in the EC2 Image Builder Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       imageBuildVersionArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the  Image  Builder  image  resource that this request
          deleted.
