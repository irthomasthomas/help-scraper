LIST-IMAGE-SCAN-FINDING-AGGREGATIONS()  LIST-IMAGE-SCAN-FINDING-AGGREGATIONS()



NAME
       list-image-scan-finding-aggregations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  image scan aggregations for your account. You can
       filter by the type of key that Image Builder uses to group results. For
       example,  if  you  want to get a list of findings by severity level for
       one of your pipelines, you might specify your  pipeline  with  the  im-
       agePipelineArn filter. If you don't specify a filter, Image Builder re-
       turns an aggregation for your account.

       To streamline results, you can use the following filters  in  your  re-
       quest:

       o accountId

       o imageBuildVersionArn

       o imagePipelineArn

       o vulnerabilityId

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific
          list of results from a list operation. Filters can be used to  match
          a  set  of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes,
          or IDs.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          values -> (list)
              The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "values": ["string", ...]
          }

       --next-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  nextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       aggregationType -> (string)
          The aggregation type specifies what type of key is used to group the
          image scan findings. Image Builder returns results based on the  re-
          quest  filter.  If  you  didn't specify a filter in the request, the
          type defaults to accountId .
