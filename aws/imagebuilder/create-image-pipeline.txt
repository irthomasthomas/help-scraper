          to configure images created by this image pipeline.

       --container-recipe-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe that is used
          to configure images created by this container pipeline.

       --infrastructure-configuration-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  infrastructure  configuration
          that will be used to build images created by this image pipeline.

       --distribution-configuration-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the distribution configuration
          that will be used to configure and distribute images created by this
          image pipeline.

       --image-tests-configuration (structure)
          The image test configuration of the image pipeline.

          imageTestsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Determines  if  tests should run after building the image. Image
              Builder defaults to enable tests  to  run  following  the  image
              build, before image distribution.

          timeoutMinutes -> (integer)
              The maximum time in minutes that tests are permitted to run.

              NOTE:
                 The  timeoutMinutes  attribute  is not currently active. This
                 value is ignored.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageTestsEnabled=boolean,timeoutMinutes=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "imageTestsEnabled": true|false,
            "timeoutMinutes": integer
          }

       --enhanced-image-metadata-enabled  |   --no-enhanced-image-metadata-en-
       abled (boolean)
          Collects  additional  information about the image being created, in-
          cluding the operating system (OS) version and package list. This in-
          formation is used to enhance the overall experience of using EC2 Im-
          age Builder. Enabled by default.

       --schedule (structure)
          The schedule of the image pipeline.

          scheduleExpression -> (string)
              The cron expression determines how often EC2 Image Builder eval-
              uates your pipelineExecutionStartCondition .

              For  information  on  how  to  format a cron expression in Image
              Builder, see Use cron expressions in EC2 Image Builder .

          timezone -> (string)
              The timezone that applies to the scheduling expression. For  ex-
              ample,  "Etc/UTC",  "America/Los_Angeles"  in  the IANA timezone
              format . If not specified this defaults to UTC.

          pipelineExecutionStartCondition -> (string)
              The condition configures when the pipeline should trigger a  new
              image  build. When the pipelineExecutionStartCondition is set to
              EXPRESSION_MATCH_AND_DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_AVAILABLE , and you  use
              semantic version filters on the base image or components in your
              image recipe, EC2 Image Builder will build a new image only when
              there are new versions of the image or components in your recipe
              that match the semantic version filter. When it is  set  to  EX-
              PRESSION_MATCH_ONLY  ,  it will build a new image every time the
              CRON expression matches the current time. For  semantic  version
              syntax,  see CreateComponent in the EC2 Image Builder API Refer-
              ence .

       Shorthand Syntax:

                 dont provide this information, Image Builder creates a repos-
                 itory  in  your   account   named   image-builder-image-scan-
                 ning-repository  for  vulnerability scans of your output con-
                 tainer images.

              containerTags -> (list)
                 Tags for Image Builder to apply to the output container image

                 Test workflows are defined within named runtime groups called
                 parallel groups. The parallel group is the named  group  that
                 contains this test workflow. Test workflows within a parallel
                 group can run at the same time. Image Builder  starts  up  to
                 five test workflows in the group at the same time, and starts
                 additional workflows as others complete, until all  workflows
                 in the group have completed. This field only applies for test
                 workflows.

              onFailure -> (string)
                 The action to take if the workflow fails.

          that grants Image Builder access to perform workflow actions.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
