OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the workflow to create.

       --semantic-version (string)
          The semantic version of this workflow resource. The semantic version
          syntax adheres to the following rules.

          NOTE:
              The   semantic   version   has    four    nodes:    <major>.<mi-
              nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three,
              and can filter on all of them.
                 Assignment: For the first three nodes you can assign any pos-
                 itive  integer  value, including zero, with an upper limit of
                 2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder  automati-
                 cally assigns the build number to the fourth node.

                 Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the
                 assignment requirements for the nodes that  you  can  assign.
                 For  example,  you  might  choose a software version pattern,
                 such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

       --description (string)
          Describes the workflow.

       --change-description (string)
          Describes what change has been made in this version of the workflow,
          or  what  makes  this  version  different from other versions of the
          workflow.

       --data (string)
          Contains the UTF-8 encoded YAML document content for  the  workflow.
          Alternatively,  you  can  specify  the  uri  of a YAML document file
          stored in Amazon S3. However, you cannot specify both properties.

       --uri (string)
          The uri of a YAML component document file. This must be  an  S3  URL
          (s3://bucket/key ), and the requester must have permission to access
          the S3 bucket it points to. If you use Amazon S3,  you  can  specify
          component content up to your service quota.

          Alternatively,  you  can specify the YAML document inline, using the
          component data property. You cannot specify both properties.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the KMS key that is used  to  encrypt  this  workflow  re-
          source.

       --tags (map)
          Tags that apply to the workflow resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency
          of the request. For more information, see  Ensuring  idempotency  in
          the Amazon EC2 API Reference .

       --type (string)
          The phase in the image build process for which the workflow resource
          is responsible.

          Possible values:

          o BUILD

          o TEST

          o DISTRIBUTION

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       clientToken -> (string)
          The client token that uniquely identifies the request.

       workflowBuildVersionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the workflow resource that the re-
          quest created.
