OPTIONS
       --image-build-version-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image that you want to get.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       image -> (structure)
          The image object.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image.

              NOTE:
                 Semantic versioning is included in each object's  Amazon  Re-
                 source  Name  (ARN), at the level that applies to that object
                 as follows:

                 o Versionless ARNs and Name ARNs do not include specific val-
                   ues  in any of the nodes. The nodes are either left off en-
                   tirely, or they are specified as  wildcards,  for  example:
                   x.x.x.

                 o Version  ARNs have only the first three nodes: <major>.<mi-
                   nor>.<patch>

                 o Build version ARNs have all four nodes, and point to a spe-
                   cific build for a specific version of an object.

          type -> (string)
              Specifies  whether this image produces an AMI or a container im-
              age.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the image.

          version -> (string)
              The semantic version of the image.

              NOTE:
                 The   semantic   version   has   four   nodes:   <major>.<mi-
                 nor>.<patch>/<build>.  You  can  assign  values for the first
                 three, and can filter on all of them.
                     Assignment: For the first three nodes you can assign  any
                     positive  integer  value,  including  zero, with an upper
                     limit of 2^30-1,  or  1073741823  for  each  node.  Image
                     Builder  automatically  assigns  the  build number to the
                     fourth node.

                     Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to
                     the  assignment  requirements  for the nodes that you can
                     assign. For example, you might choose a software  version
                     pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

                     Filtering:  With semantic versioning, you have the flexi-
                     bility to use wildcards (x) to specify  the  most  recent
                     versions or nodes when selecting the base image or compo-
                     nents for your recipe. When you use  a  wildcard  in  any
                     node,  all  nodes to the right of the first wildcard must
                     also be wildcards.

          platform -> (string)
              The image operating system platform, such as Linux or Windows.

          enhancedImageMetadataEnabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether Image Builder collects additional  information
              about  the  image, such as the operating system (OS) version and
              package list.

          osVersion -> (string)
              The operating system version for instances that launch from this
              image. For example, Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu 18, or Microsoft Win-
              dows Server 2019.

          state -> (structure)
              The state of the image.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the image.

              reason -> (string)
                 The reason for the status of the image.

          imageRecipe -> (structure)
              For images that distribute an AMI, this is the image recipe that
              Image  Builder  used  to create the image. For container images,
              this is empty.

              arn -> (string)

                 tion.  Instance  configuration  adds  a layer of control over
                 those instances. You can define settings and add  scripts  to
                 run when an instance is launched from your AMI.

                 systemsManagerAgent -> (structure)
                     Contains  settings  for the Systems Manager agent on your
                     build instance.

                     uninstallAfterBuild -> (boolean)
                        Controls whether the Systems Manager agent is  removed
                        from your final build image, prior to creating the new
                        AMI. If this is set to true, then the agent is removed
                        from  the  final image. If it's set to false, then the
                        agent is left in, so that it is included  in  the  new
                        AMI. The default value is false.

                 userDataOverride -> (string)
                     Use this property to provide commands or a command script
                     to run when you launch your build instance.

                     The userDataOverride property replaces any commands  that
                     Image  Builder  might  have  added to ensure that Systems
                     Manager is installed on your Linux build instance. If you
                     override  the  user data, make sure that you add commands
                     to install Systems Manager, if it is not pre-installed on
                     your base image.

                     NOTE:
                        The  user data is always base 64 encoded. For example,
                        the  following  commands  are   encoded   as   IyEvYm-
                        luL2Jhc2gKbWtkaXIgLXAgL3Zhci9iYi8KdG91Y2ggL3Zhci$ :
                            #!/bin/bash

                        mkdir -p /var/bb/

                        touch /var

          containerRecipe -> (structure)
              For  container  images,  this is the container recipe that Image
              Builder used to create the image. For images that distribute  an
              AMI, this is empty.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe.

                 NOTE:
                     Semantic  versioning  is included in each object's Amazon
                     Resource Name (ARN), at the level that  applies  to  that
                     object as follows:

                     o Versionless  ARNs and Name ARNs do not include specific
                       values in any of the nodes. The nodes are  either  left
                       off  entirely,  or they are specified as wildcards, for
                       example: x.x.x.

                     o Version ARNs have only  the  first  three  nodes:  <ma-
                       jor>.<minor>.<patch>

                     o Build  version ARNs have all four nodes, and point to a
                       specific build for a specific version of an object.

              containerType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of container, such as Docker.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the container recipe.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the container recipe.

              platform -> (string)
                 The system platform for the container,  such  as  Windows  or
                 Linux.

              owner -> (string)
                 The owner of the container recipe.

              version -> (string)
                 The semantic version of the container recipe.

                 NOTE:
                     The   semantic   version  has  four  nodes:  <major>.<mi-
                     nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first
                     three, and can filter on all of them.
                        Assignment:  For  the first three nodes you can assign
                        any positive integer value, including  zero,  with  an
                        upper  limit  of  2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node.
                        Image Builder automatically assigns the  build  number
                        to the fourth node.

                        Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres
                        to the assignment requirements for the nodes that  you
                        can  assign.  For example, you might choose a software
                        version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or  a  date,  such  as
                        2021.01.01.

                        Filtering:  With  semantic  versioning,  you  have the
                        flexibility to use wildcards (x) to specify  the  most
                        recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image
                        or components for your recipe. When you use a wildcard
                        in any node, all nodes to the right of the first wild-
                        card must also be wildcards.

              components -> (list)
                 Build and test components that are included in the  container
                 recipe. Recipes require a minimum of one build component, and

                     the response as follows:

                     o required  When you retrieve the IAM  role  credentials,
                       version 2.0 credentials are returned in all cases.

                     o optional  You can include a signed token header in your
                       request to retrieve instance metadata, or you can leave
                       it  out. If you include it, version 2.0 credentials are
                       returned for the IAM role. Otherwise, version 1.0  cre-
                       dentials are returned.

                     is  one  hop.  However, if HTTP tokens are required, con-
                     tainer image builds need a minimum of two hops.

          executionRole -> (string)
              The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role you cre-
              ate that grants Image Builder access  to  perform  workflow  ac-
              tions.

          workflows -> (list)
              Contains  the  build and test workflows that are associated with
              the image.

              (structure)
                 Contains control settings and configurable inputs for a work-

                 workflowArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the workflow resource.

                 parameters -> (list)
                     Contains parameter values for each of the parameters that
                     the workflow document defined for the workflow resource.

                     (structure)
                        Contains a key/value pair that sets the named workflow
                        parameter.

                        name -> (string)
                            The name of the workflow parameter to set.

                 parallelGroup -> (string)
                     Test  workflows  are  defined within named runtime groups
                     called parallel groups. The parallel group is  the  named
                     group  that  contains  this test workflow. Test workflows
                     within a parallel group can run at the same  time.  Image
                     Builder  starts up to five test workflows in the group at
                     the same time, and starts additional workflows as  others
                     complete,  until  all  workflows  in  the group have com-
                     pleted. This field only applies for test workflows.

                 onFailure -> (string)
