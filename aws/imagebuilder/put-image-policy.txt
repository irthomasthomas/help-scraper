PUT-IMAGE-POLICY()                                          PUT-IMAGE-POLICY()



NAME
       put-image-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  a  policy  to an image. We recommend that you call the RAM API
       CreateResourceShare to share resources. If you call the  Image  Builder
       API    PutImagePolicy    ,   you   must   also   call   the   RAM   API
       PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy in order for the resource  to  be
       visible to all principals with whom the resource is shared.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image that this policy should
          be applied to.

       --policy (string)
          The policy to apply.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To apply a resource policy to an image

       The following put-image-policy command applies a resource policy to  an
       image  to  enable cross-account sharing of images. We recommend you use
       the RAM CLI command create-resource-share. If you  use  the  EC2  Image
       Builder  CLI  command  put-image-policy,  you must also use the RAM CLI
       command promote-resource-share-create-from-policy in order for the  re-
       source  to  be  visible  to  all  principals  with whom the resource is
       shared.

          aws imagebuilder put-image-policy \
              --image-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image/example-image/2019.12.02/1 \
              --policy '{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "AWS": [ "123456789012" ] }, "Action": [ "imagebuilder:GetImage", "imagebuilder:ListImages" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image/example-image/2019.12.02/1" ] } ] }'

       Output:

          {
              "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "imageArn": "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image/example-image/2019.12.02/1"
          }

       Image Pipeline Using the AWS CLI in the EC2 Image Builder Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       imageArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image that this policy was ap-
          plied to.
