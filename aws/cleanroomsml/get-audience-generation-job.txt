OPTIONS
       --audience-generation-job-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the audience generation job that
          you are interested in.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          for this audience generation job.

          This  field  will  be null if the account calling the API is the ac-
          count that started this audience generation job.

              Defines the Amazon S3 bucket where the  seed  audience  for  the
              generating  audience  is  stored.  A valid data source is a JSON
              line file in the following format:
                 {"user_id": "111111"}

                 {"user_id": "222222"}

          roleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that can read the Amazon S3 bucket where
              the seed audience is stored.

          sqlParameters -> (structure)
              The protected SQL query parameters.

       includeSeedInOutput -> (boolean)
          Configure whether the seed users are included in  the  output  audi-
          ence.  By default, Clean Rooms ML removes seed users from the output
          audience. If you specify TRUE , the seed users will appear first  in
          the output. Clean Rooms ML does not explicitly reveal whether a user
          was in the seed, but the recipient of the audience  will  know  that
          the first minimumSeedSize count of users are from the seed.

       collaborationId -> (string)
          The  identifier  of  the collaboration that this audience generation
          job is associated with.

       metrics -> (structure)
          The relevance scores for different audience  sizes  and  the  recall
          score of the generated audience.

          relevanceMetrics -> (list)
              The relevance scores of the generated audience.

              (structure)
                 The relevance score of a generated audience.

                 audienceSize -> (structure)
                     The size of the generated audience. Must match one of the
                     sizes in the configured audience model.

                     type -> (string)
                        Whether the audience size is defined in absolute terms
                        or  as  a percentage. You can use the ABSOLUTE   Audi-
                        enceSize to configure out  audience  sizes  using  the
                        count  of  identifiers  in the output. You can use the
                        Percentage   AudienceSize to configure  sizes  in  the
                        range 1-100 percent.

                     value -> (integer)

                     The relevance score of the generated audience.

          recallMetric -> (double)
              The  recall  score of the generated audience. Recall is the per-
              centage of the most similar users (by default, the most  similar
              20%) from a sample of the training data that are included in the
              seed audience by the audience generation job. Values range  from
              0-1,  larger  values  indicate a better audience. A recall value
              approximately equal to the maximum bin size indicates  that  the
              audience model is equivalent to random selection.

       startedBy -> (string)
          The AWS account that started this audience generation job.

       tags -> (map)
          The tags that are associated to this audience generation job.

          value -> (string)

       protectedQueryIdentifier -> (string)
          The  unique identifier of the protected query for this audience gen-
          eration job.
