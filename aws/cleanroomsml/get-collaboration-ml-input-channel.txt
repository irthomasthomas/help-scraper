OPTIONS
       --ml-input-channel-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ML input channel that you want
          to get.

       --collaboration-identifier (string)
          The collaboration ID of the collaboration that contains the ML input
          channel that you want to get.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       createTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the ML input channel was created.

       updateTime -> (timestamp)
          The most recent time at which the ML input channel was updated.

       creatorAccountId -> (string)
          The account ID of the member who created the ML input channel.

       membershipIdentifier -> (string)
          The membership ID of the membership that contains the ML input chan-
          nel.

       collaborationIdentifier -> (string)
          The collaboration ID of the collaboration that contains the ML input
          channel.

       mlInputChannelArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ML input channel.

       name -> (string)
          The name of the ML input channel.

       configuredModelAlgorithmAssociations -> (list)
          The configured model algorithm associations that were used to create
          the ML input channel.

          (string)

       status -> (string)
          The status of the ML input channel.

       statusDetails -> (structure)
          Details about the status of a resource.

          statusCode -> (string)
              The  status  code that was returned. The status code is intended
              for programmatic error handling. Clean Rooms ML will not  change
              the status code for existing error conditions.

          message -> (string)
              The error message that was returned. The message is intended for
              human consumption and can change at any time. Use the statusCode
              for programmatic error handling.

       retentionInDays -> (integer)
          The number of days to retain the data for the ML input channel.

       numberOfRecords -> (long)
          The number of records in the ML input channel.

       description -> (string)
          The description of the ML input channel.
