OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the configured model algorithm.

       --description (string)
          The description of the configured model algorithm.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that is  used  to  access
          the repository.

       --training-container-config (structure)
          Configuration  information for the training container, including en-
          trypoints and arguments.

          imageUri -> (string)
              The registry path of the docker image that  contains  the  algo-
              rithm.  Clean  Rooms  ML supports both registry/repository[:tag]
              and registry/repositry[@digest] image path formats. For more in-
              formation  about  using  images  in  Clean  Rooms  ML,  see  the
              Sagemaker API reference .

          entrypoint -> (list)
              The entrypoint script for a  Docker  container  used  to  run  a
              training  job.  This  script  takes  precedence over the default
              train processing instructions. See  How  Amazon  SageMaker  Runs
              Your  Training Image for additional information. For more infor-
              mation, see How Sagemaker runs your training image .

              (string)

          arguments -> (list)
              The arguments for a container used to run a  training  job.  See

              metric name and regular  expressions  used  to  parse  algorithm
              logs.  Amazon  Web Services Clean Rooms ML publishes each metric
              to all members' Amazon CloudWatch using IAM role  configured  in
              PutMLConfiguration .

              (structure)
                 Information  about  the  model  metric that is reported for a

            "imageUri": "string",
            "entrypoint": ["string", ...],
            "arguments": ["string", ...],
            "metricDefinitions": [
              {
                "name": "string",
                "regex": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --inference-container-config (structure)
          Configuration  information  for the inference container that is used
          when you run an inference job on a configured model algorithm.

          imageUri -> (string)
              The registry path of the docker image that contains  the  infer-
              ence  algorithm.  Clean  Rooms ML supports both registry/reposi-
              tory[:tag] and registry/repositry[@digest] image  path  formats.
              For  more  information about using images in Clean Rooms ML, see
              the Sagemaker API reference .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageUri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "imageUri": "string"
          }

       --tags (map)
          The optional metadata that you apply to the  resource  to  help  you
          categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
          tional value, both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do  not  use  aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You  can-
            not edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this
            prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not,
            then  Clean  Rooms ML considers it to be a user tag and will count
            against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws
            do not count against your tags per resource limit.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --kms-key-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key. This key is used to
          encrypt and decrypt customer-owned data in the configured  ML  model
          algorithm and associated data.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       configuredModelAlgorithmArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the configured model algorithm.
