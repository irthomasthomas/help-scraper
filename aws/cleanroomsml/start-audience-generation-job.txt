OPTIONS
       --collaboration-id (string)
          The  identifier of the collaboration that contains the audience gen-
          eration job.

       --configured-audience-model-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the configured audience model that
          is used for this audience generation job.

       --description (string)
          The description of the audience generation job.

       --include-seed-in-output | --no-include-seed-in-output (boolean)
          Whether  the  seed  audience  is included in the audience generation
          output.

       --name (string)
          The name of the audience generation job.

       --seed-audience (structure)
          The seed audience that is used to generate the audience.

          dataSource -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket where the training data for the  configured
              audience is stored.

              s3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 location URI.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that can read the Amazon S3 bucket where
              the training data is stored.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          dataSource={s3Uri=string},roleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "dataSource": {
              "s3Uri": "string"
            },
            "roleArn": "string"
          }

       --tags (map)
          The optional metadata that you apply to the  resource  to  help  you
          categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
          tional value, both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do  not  use  aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You  can-
            not edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this
            prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not,
            then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against
            the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do  not
            count against your tags per resource limit.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

       audienceGenerationJobArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the audience generation job.
