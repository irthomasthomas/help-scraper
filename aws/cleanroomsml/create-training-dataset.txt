NAME
       create-training-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Defines the information necessary to create a training dataset, or seed
       audience. In Clean Rooms  ML,  the  TrainingDataset  is  metadata  that
       points  to  a  Glue table, which is read only during AudienceModel cre-
       ation.

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          The description of the training dataset.

       --name (string)
          The name of the training dataset. This name must be unique  in  your
          account and region.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the IAM role that Clean Rooms ML can assume to read the
          data referred to in the dataSource field of each dataset.

          Passing a role across AWS accounts is not allowed.  If  you  pass  a
          role  that  isn't  in your account, you get an AccessDeniedException
          error.

       --tags (map)
          The optional metadata that you apply to the  resource  to  help  you
          categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
          tional value, both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do  not  use  aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You  can-
            not edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this
            prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not,
            then  Clean  Rooms ML considers it to be a user tag and will count
            against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws
            do not count against your tags per resource limit.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
