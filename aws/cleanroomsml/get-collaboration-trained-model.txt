OPTIONS
       --trained-model-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the trained model that you want to
          return information about.

       --collaboration-identifier (string)
          The collaboration ID that contains the trained model that  you  want
          to return information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          The membership ID of the member that created the trained model.

       collaborationIdentifier -> (string)
          The  collaboration ID of the collaboration that contains the trained
          model.

       trainedModelArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the trained model.

       name -> (string)
          The name of the trained model.

       description -> (string)
          The description of the trained model.

       status -> (string)

       statusDetails -> (structure)
          Details about the status of a resource.

          statusCode -> (string)
              The status code that was returned. The status code  is  intended
              for  programmatic error handling. Clean Rooms ML will not change
              the status code for existing error conditions.

          message -> (string)
              The error message that was returned. The message is intended for
              human consumption and can change at any time. Use the statusCode
              for programmatic error handling.

       configuredModelAlgorithmAssociationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the configured model algorithm as-
          sociation that was used to create this trained model.

       resourceConfig -> (structure)
          The EC2 resource configuration that was used to train this model.

          instanceCount -> (integer)
              The number of resources that are used to train the model.

          instanceType -> (string)
              The instance type that is used to train the model.

          volumeSizeInGB -> (integer)

              run before it is terminated.

       metricsStatus -> (string)
          The status of the model metrics.

       metricsStatusDetails -> (string)
          Details about the status information for the model metrics.

          Status information for the logs.

       logsStatusDetails -> (string)
          Details about the status information for the logs.

       trainingContainerImageDigest -> (string)
          Information about the training container image.
