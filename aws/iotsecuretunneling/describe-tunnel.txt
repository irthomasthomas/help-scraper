OPTIONS
       --tunnel-id (string)
          The tunnel to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       tunnel -> (structure)
          The tunnel being described.

          tunnelId -> (string)
              A unique alpha-numeric ID that identifies a tunnel.

          tunnelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a tunnel.

          status -> (string)
              The status of a tunnel. Valid values are: Open and Closed.

          sourceConnectionState -> (structure)
              The connection state of the source application.

              status -> (string)
                 The  connection  status  of the tunnel. Valid values are CON-
                 NECTED and DISCONNECTED .

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the connection status was updated.

          destinationConnectionState -> (structure)
              The connection state of the destination application.

              status -> (string)
                 The connection status of the tunnel. Valid  values  are  CON-
                 NECTED and DISCONNECTED .

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the connection status was updated.

          description -> (string)
              A description of the tunnel.

          destinationConfig -> (structure)
              The  destination  configuration that specifies the thing name of
              the destination device and a service name that the  local  proxy
              uses to connect to the destination application.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT thing to which you want to connect.

              services -> (list)
                 A list of service names that identify the target application.
                 The IoT client running on the destination device  reads  this
                 value  and  uses  it to look up a port or an IP address and a
                 port. The IoT client instantiates the local proxy, which uses
                 this information to connect to the destination application.

                 (string)

          timeoutConfig -> (structure)
              Timeout configuration for the tunnel.

              maxLifetimeTimeoutMinutes -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  amount of time (in minutes) a tunnel can remain
                 open. If not specified, maxLifetimeTimeoutMinutes defaults to
                 720  minutes. Valid values are from 1 minute to 12 hours (720
                 minutes)

          tags -> (list)
              A list of tag metadata associated with the secure tunnel.

              (structure)
                 An arbitary key/value pair used to add searchable metadata to
                 secure tunnel resources.

                 key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the tunnel was created.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The last time the tunnel was updated.
