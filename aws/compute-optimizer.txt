COMPUTE-OPTIMIZER()                                        COMPUTE-OPTIMIZER()



NAME
       compute-optimizer -

DESCRIPTION
       Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and uti-
       lization metrics of your Amazon Web Services compute resources, such as
       Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Lambda functions,
       Amazon EBS volumes, and Amazon ECS  services  on  Fargate.  It  reports
       whether  your  resources are optimal, and generates optimization recom-
       mendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your work-
       loads.  Compute Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric data,
       in addition to projected utilization metric data  for  the  recommenda-
       tions,  which you can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the
       best price-performance trade-off. The analysis of your  usage  patterns
       can  help you decide when to move or resize your running resources, and
       still meet your performance and capacity requirements. For more  infor-
       mation  about  Compute Optimizer, including the required permissions to
       use the service, see the Compute Optimizer User Guide .
