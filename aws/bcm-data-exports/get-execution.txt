OPTIONS
       --execution-id (string)
          The ID for this specific execution.

       --export-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Export object that generated
          this specific execution.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

          since the execution was generated.

                 file.

                     The  name of the Amazon S3 bucket used as the destination
                     of a data export file.

                 S3OutputConfigurations -> (structure)
                     The output configuration for the data export.

                     Overwrite -> (string)
                        The rule to follow when generating a  version  of  the
                        data export file. You have the choice to overwrite the
                        previous version or to be delivered in addition to the
                        previous  versions.  Overwriting  exports  can save on
                        Amazon S3 storage costs. Creating new export  versions
                        allows you to track the changes in cost and usage data
                        over time.

                     The S3 path prefix you want prepended to the name of your
                     data export.

                 S3Region -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket Region.

          ExportArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for this export.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of this specific data export.

          RefreshCadence -> (structure)
              The cadence for Amazon Web Services to update the export in your
              S3 bucket.

              Frequency -> (string)
                 The frequency that data exports are updated. The  export  re-
                 freshes  each time the source data updates, up to three times
                 daily.
