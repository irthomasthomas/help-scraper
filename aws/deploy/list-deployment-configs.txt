LIST-DEPLOYMENT-CONFIGS()                            LIST-DEPLOYMENT-CONFIGS()



NAME
       list-deployment-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the deployment configurations with the IAM user or AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-deployment-configs  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: deploymentConfigsList

SYNOPSIS
            list-deployment-configs
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about deployment configurations

       The  following  list-deployment-configs  example  displays  information
       about all deployment configurations that are associated with the user's
       AWS account.

          aws deploy list-deployment-configs

       Output:

          {
              "deploymentConfigsList": [
                  "ThreeQuartersHealthy",
                  "CodeDeployDefault.AllAtOnce",
                  "CodeDeployDefault.HalfAtATime",
                  "CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       deploymentConfigsList -> (list)
          A list of deployment configurations, including  built-in  configura-
          tions such as CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime .

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  a large amount of information is returned, an identifier is also
          returned. It can be used in a subsequent list deployment  configura-
          tions  call  to  return the next set of deployment configurations in
          the list.
