BATCH-GET-DEPLOYMENT-TARGETS()                  BATCH-GET-DEPLOYMENT-TARGETS()



NAME
       batch-get-deployment-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array of one or more targets associated with a deployment.
       This method works with all compute types and should be used instead  of
       the deprecated BatchGetDeploymentInstances . The maximum number of tar-
       gets that can be returned is 25.

       The type of targets returned depends on the deployment's compute  plat-
       form or deployment method:

       o EC2/On-premises : Information about Amazon EC2 instance targets.

       o Lambda : Information about Lambda functions targets.

       o Amazon ECS : Information about Amazon ECS service targets.

       o CloudFormation  : Information about targets of blue/green deployments
         initiated by a CloudFormation stack update.

          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-id (string)
          The unique ID of a deployment.

       --target-ids (list)
          The unique IDs of the deployment targets. The  compute  platform  of
          the deployment determines the type of the targets and their formats.
          The maximum number of deployment target IDs you can specify is 25.

          o For deployments that use the EC2/On-premises compute platform, the
            target  IDs are Amazon EC2 or on-premises instances IDs, and their
            target type is instanceTarget .

          o For deployments that use the Lambda compute platform,  the  target
            IDs  are  the  names of Lambda functions, and their target type is
            instanceTarget .

          o For deployments that use the Amazon ECS compute platform, the tar-
            get  IDs  are  pairs of Amazon ECS clusters and services specified
            using the format <clustername>:<servicename> . Their  target  type
            is ecsTarget .

          o For  deployments that are deployed with CloudFormation, the target
            IDs are CloudFormation stack IDs. Their target type is cloudForma-
            tionTarget .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the targets associated with a deployment

       The  following batch-get-deployment-targets example returns information
       about one of the targets associated with the specified deployment.

              --deployment-id "d-1A2B3C4D5" \
              --target-ids "i-01a2b3c4d5e6f1111"

                        tasks are running, and whether  the  task  set  serves
                        production  traffic.  An  CodeDeploy  application that
                        uses the Amazon ECS compute platform  deploys  a  con-
                        tainerized  application  in an Amazon ECS service as a

                            ployment  that  uses  the Amazon ECS compute type,
                            CodeDeploy instructs Amazon ECS to  create  a  new
                            task set and uses this value to determine how many
                            tasks to create. After the  updated  task  set  is
                            created, CodeDeploy shifts traffic to the new task
                            set.

                            ment. A task in the PENDING state is preparing  to
                            enter  the  RUNNING  state.  A task set enters the

                            time,  or  when it is restarted after being in the
                            STOPPED state.

                        runningCount -> (long)

                            ment. A task in the RUNNING state is  running  and
                            ready for use.

                              duction traffic.

                            o ACTIVE  :  Indicates the task set is not serving
                              production traffic.

                            o DRAINING : Indicates the tasks in the  task  set
                              are  being  stopped and their corresponding tar-
                              gets are being deregistered  from  their  target

                            target group is used by CodeDeploy to manage traf-
                            fic to a task set.

                               vironment  are deregistered from, and instances
                               in the replacement environment  are  registered
                               with. For in-place deployments, the name of the
                               target group that  instances  are  deregistered
                               from,  so they are not serving traffic during a
                               deployment, and then re-registered  with  after
                               the deployment is complete.
