LIST-DEPLOYMENTS()                                          LIST-DEPLOYMENTS()



NAME
       list-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  deployments in a deployment group for an application regis-
       tered with the IAM user or AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-deployments is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: deployments

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The  name  of  an AWS CodeDeploy application associated with the IAM
          user or AWS account.

          NOTE:
              If applicationName is specified, then  deploymentGroupName  must
              be  specified.  If it is not specified, then deploymentGroupName
              must not be specified.

       --deployment-group-name (string)
          The name of a deployment group for the specified application.

          NOTE:
              If deploymentGroupName is specified, then  applicationName  must
              be  specified. If it is not specified, then applicationName must
              not be specified.

       --external-id (string)
          The unique ID of an  external  resource  for  returning  deployments
          linked to the external resource.

       --include-only-statuses (list)
          A subset of deployments to list by status:

          o Created : Include created deployments in the resulting list.

          o Queued : Include queued deployments in the resulting list.

          o In  Progress  :  Include  in-progress deployments in the resulting
            list.

          o Succeeded : Include successful deployments in the resulting list.

          o Failed : Include failed deployments in the resulting list.

          o Stopped : Include stopped deployments in the resulting list.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Created
            Queued
            InProgress
            Baking
            Succeeded
            Failed
            Stopped
            Ready

       --create-time-range (structure)
          A time range (start and end) for returning a subset of the  list  of
          deployments.

          start -> (timestamp)
              The start time of the time range.

              NOTE:
                 Specify null to leave the start time open-ended.

          end -> (timestamp)
              The end time of the time range.

              NOTE:
                 Specify null to leave the end time open-ended.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          start=timestamp,end=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "start": timestamp,
            "end": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about deployments

       The  following  list-deployments example displays information about all
       deployments that are associated with the specified application and  de-
       ployment group.

          aws deploy list-deployments \
              --application-name WordPress_App \
              --create-time-range start=2014-08-19T00:00:00,end=2014-08-20T00:00:00 \
              --deployment-group-name WordPress_DG \
              --include-only-statuses Failed

       Output:

          {
              "deployments": [
                  "d-EXAMPLE11",
                  "d-EXAMPLE22",
                  "d-EXAMPLE33"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       deployments -> (list)
          A list of deployment IDs.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  a large amount of information is returned, an identifier is also
          returned. It can be used in a subsequent list  deployments  call  to
          return the next set of deployments in the list.
