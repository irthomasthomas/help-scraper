LIST-ON-PREMISES-INSTANCES()                      LIST-ON-PREMISES-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-on-premises-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of names for one or more on-premises instances.

       Unless   otherwise   specified,   both   registered   and  deregistered
       on-premises instance names are  listed.  To  list  only  registered  or
       deregistered  on-premises  instance  names, use the registration status
       parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-on-premises-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: instanceNames

OPTIONS
       --registration-status (string)
          The registration status of the on-premises instances:

          o Deregistered  :  Include deregistered on-premises instances in the
            resulting list.

          o Registered : Include registered on-premises instances in  the  re-
            sulting list.

          Possible values:

          o Registered

          o Deregistered

       --tag-filters (list)
          The  on-premises  instance  tags  that  are  used  to  restrict  the
          on-premises instance names returned.

          (structure)
              Information about an on-premises instance tag filter.

              Key -> (string)
                 The on-premises instance tag filter key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The on-premises instance tag filter value.

              Type -> (string)
                 The on-premises instance tag filter type:

                 o KEY_ONLY: Key only.

                 o VALUE_ONLY: Value only.

                 o KEY_AND_VALUE: Key and value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Type": "KEY_ONLY"|"VALUE_ONLY"|"KEY_AND_VALUE"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about one or more on-premises instances

       The following list-on-premises-instances example retrieves  a  list  of
       available  on-premises instance names for instances that are registered
       in AWS CodeDeploy and also have the specified on-premises instance  tag
       associated in AWS CodeDeploy with the instance.

          aws deploy list-on-premises-instances \
              --registration-status Registered \
              --tag-filters Key=Name,Value=CodeDeployDemo-OnPrem,Type=KEY_AND_VALUE

       Output:

          {
              "instanceNames": [
                  "AssetTag12010298EX"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       instanceNames -> (list)
          The list of matching on-premises instance names.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  a large amount of information is returned, an identifier is also
          returned. It can be used in a subsequent list on-premises  instances
          call to return the next set of on-premises instances in the list.
