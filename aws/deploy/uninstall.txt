       To uninstall an on-premises instance

       The following uninstall example uninstalls  the  AWS  CodeDeploy  Agent
       from the on-premises instance and removes the on-premises configuration
       file from the instance. It doesn't deregister the instance in AWS  Cod-
       eDeploy,  nor disassociate any on-premises instance tags in AWS CodeDe-
       ploy from the instance, nor delete the IAM user that is associated with
       the instance.

          aws deploy uninstall

       This command produces no output.
