NAME
       register-on-premises-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers an on-premises instance.

          Only  one  IAM ARN (an IAM session ARN or IAM user ARN) is supported
          in the request. You cannot use both.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-on-premises-instance
          --instance-name <value>
          [--iam-session-arn <value>]
          [--iam-user-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-name (string)
          The name of the on-premises instance to register.

       --iam-session-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM session to associate  with  the  on-premises  in-
          stance.

       --iam-user-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM user to associate with the on-premises instance.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To register an on-premises instance

       The   following   register-on-premises-instance  example  registers  an
       on-premises instance with AWS CodeDeploy. It does not create the speci-
       fied  IAM user, nor does it associate in AWS CodeDeploy any on-premises
       instances tags with the registered instance.

          aws deploy register-on-premises-instance \
              --instance-name AssetTag12010298EX \
              --iam-user-arn arn:aws:iam::80398EXAMPLE:user/CodeDeployDemoUser-OnPrem

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
