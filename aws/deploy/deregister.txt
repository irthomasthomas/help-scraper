OPTIONS
       --instance-name  (string)  Required.  The  name  of the on-premises in-
       stance.

       --no-delete-iam-user (boolean) Optional. Do not delete the IAM user for

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To deregister an on-premises instance

       The  following  deregister  example deregisters an on-premises instance
       with AWS CodeDeploy. It does not delete the IAM user that is associated
       with  the  instance. It disassociates in AWS CodeDeploy the on-premises
       tags from the instance. It does not uninstall the AWS CodeDeploy  Agent
       from  the  instance  nor remove the on-premises configuration file from
       the instance.

          aws deploy deregister \
              --instance-name AssetTag12010298EX \
              --no-delete-iam-user \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          IamUserArn: arn:aws:iam::80398EXAMPLE:user/AWS/CodeDeploy/AssetTag12010298EX

          Removing tags from the on-premises instance... DONE
          Deregistering the on-premises instance... DONE
          Run the following command on the on-premises instance to uninstall the codedeploy-agent:
