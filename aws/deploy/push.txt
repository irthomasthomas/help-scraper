PUSH()                                                                  PUSH()

       plication revision, which is a zip archive file that  contains  deploy-
       able  content  and an accompanying Application Specification file (App-
       Spec file). If the upload is successful, a message is returned that de-
       scribes  how to call the create-deployment command to deploy the appli-
       cation revision from Amazon S3 to target Amazon Elastic  Compute  Cloud
       (Amazon EC2) instances.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS

          [--ignore-hidden-files | --no-ignore-hidden-files]
          [--source <path>]
          [--description <description>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name  (string)  Required.  The name of the AWS CodeDeploy
       application to be associated with the application revision.

       --s3-location (string) Required. Information about the location of  the
       application revision to be uploaded to Amazon S3. You must specify both

       s3:///

       --ignore-hidden-files |  --no-ignore-hidden-files  (boolean)  Optional.
       Set  the  --ignore-hidden-files  flag  to  not bundle and upload hidden
       files to Amazon S3; otherwise, set  the  --no-ignore-hidden-files  flag
       (the default) to bundle and upload hidden files to Amazon S3.

       --source  (string) Optional. The location of the deployable content and
       the accompanying AppSpec file on the development machine to  be  zipped
       and  uploaded  to Amazon S3. If not specified, the current directory is
       used.

       --description (string) Optional. A comment that summarizes the applica-
       tion  revision.  If  not specified, the default string "Uploaded by AWS

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To bundle and deploy an AWS CodeDeploy compatible application  revision
       to Amazon S3

       The  following push example bundles and deploys an application revision
       to Amazon S3 and then associates  the  application  revision  with  the
       specified application.

          aws deploy push \
              --application-name WordPress_App \
              --description "This is my deployment" \
              --ignore-hidden-files \
              --s3-location s3://CodeDeployDemoBucket/WordPressApp.zip \
              --source /tmp/MyLocalDeploymentFolder/

       The output describes how to use the create-deployment command to create
       a deployment that uses the uploaded application revision.

          To deploy with this revision, run:
          aws deploy create-deployment --application-name WordPress_App --deployment-config-name <deployment-config-name> --deployment-group-name <deployment-group-name> --s3-location bucket=CodeDeployDemoBucket,key=WordPressApp.zip,bundleType=zip,eTag="cecc9b8EXAMPLE50a6e71fdb88EXAMPLE",version=LFsJAUdEXAMPLEfvKtvi79L8EXAMPLE
