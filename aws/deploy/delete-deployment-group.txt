OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The  name  of an CodeDeploy application associated with the IAM user
          or Amazon Web Services account.

       --deployment-group-name (string)
          The name of a deployment group for the specified application.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a deployment group

       The following  delete-deployment-group  example  deletes  a  deployment
       group that is associated with the specified application.

          aws deploy delete-deployment-group \
              --application-name WordPress_App \
              --deployment-group-name WordPress_DG

       Output:

          {
              "hooksNotCleanedUp": []
          }

OUTPUT
       hooksNotCleanedUp -> (list)
          If  the  output  contains  no data, and the corresponding deployment
          group contained at least one Auto Scaling group, CodeDeploy success-
          fully  removed  all corresponding Auto Scaling lifecycle event hooks
          from the Amazon EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group. If the out-
          put  contains  data,  CodeDeploy  could not remove some Auto Scaling
          lifecycle event hooks from the Amazon  EC2  instances  in  the  Auto
          Scaling group.

          (structure)
              Information about an Auto Scaling group.

              name -> (string)
                 The Auto Scaling group name.

              hook -> (string)
                 An Auto Scaling lifecycle event hook name.
