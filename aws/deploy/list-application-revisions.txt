LIST-APPLICATION-REVISIONS()                      LIST-APPLICATION-REVISIONS()



NAME
       list-application-revisions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists information about revisions for an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-application-revisions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: revisions

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of an CodeDeploy application associated with  the  user  or
          Amazon Web Services account.

       --sort-by (string)
          The column name to use to sort the list results:

          o registerTime : Sort by the time the revisions were registered with
            CodeDeploy.

          o firstUsedTime : Sort by the time the revisions were first used  in
            a deployment.

          o lastUsedTime  : Sort by the time the revisions were last used in a
            deployment.

          If not specified or set to null, the results are returned in an  ar-
          bitrary order.

          Possible values:

          o registerTime

          o firstUsedTime

          o lastUsedTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The order in which to sort the list results:

          o ascending : ascending order.

          o descending : descending order.

          If not specified, the results are sorted in ascending order.

          If set to null, the results are sorted in an arbitrary order.

          Possible values:

          o ascending

          o descending

       --s3-bucket (string)
          An Amazon S3 bucket name to limit the search for revisions.

          If set to null, all of the user's buckets are searched.

       --s3-key-prefix (string)
          A  key  prefix  for the set of Amazon S3 objects to limit the search
          for revisions.

       --deployed (string)
          Whether to list revisions based on whether the revision is the  tar-
          get revision of a deployment group:

          o include : List revisions that are target revisions of a deployment
            group.

          o exclude : Do not list revisions that are target revisions of a de-
            ployment group.

          o ignore : List all revisions.

          Possible values:

          o include

          o exclude

          o ignore

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about application revisions

       The  following  list-application-revisions example displays information
       about all application revisions that are associated with the  specified
       application.

              --application-name WordPress_App \
              --s-3-bucket CodeDeployDemoBucket \
              --deployed exclude \
              --s-3-key-prefix WordPress_ \
              --sort-by lastUsedTime \
              --sort-order descending

       Output:

                     includes information about which Lambda function  to  up-
                     date  and optional Lambda functions that validate deploy-
                     ment lifecycle events.

                 The content of an AppSpec file for an Lambda  or  Amazon  ECS
                 deployment.  The  content  is  formatted  as JSON or YAML and

                     function  name,  the  alias for its original version, and
                     the alias for its  replacement  version.  The  deployment
                     shifts  traffic  from  the original version of the Lambda
                     function to the replacement version.

                     For an Amazon ECS deployment, the  content  includes  the
                     task  name,  information  about  the  load  balancer that
                     serves traffic to the container, and more.

                     For both types of deployments, the  content  can  specify
                     Lambda functions that run at specified hooks, such as Be-
                     foreInstall , during a deployment.

                 sha256 -> (string)
                     The SHA256 hash value of the revision content.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If a large amount of information is returned, an identifier is  also
          returned.  It can be used in a subsequent list application revisions
          call to return the next set of application revisions in the list.
