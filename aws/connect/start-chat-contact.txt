START-CHAT-CONTACT()                                      START-CHAT-CONTACT()



NAME
       start-chat-contact -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates a flow to start a new chat for the customer. Response of this
       API  provides  a  token  required  to  obtain  credentials   from   the
       CreateParticipantConnection  API in the Amazon Connect Participant Ser-
       vice.

       When a new chat contact is successfully created, clients must subscribe
       to  the  participants connection for the created chat within 5 minutes.
       This is achieved by invoking CreateParticipantConnection with WEBSOCKET
       and CONNECTION_CREDENTIALS.

       A 429 error occurs in the following situations:

       o API  rate  limit is exceeded. API TPS throttling returns a TooManyRe-
         quests exception.

       o The quota for concurrent active chats is exceeded. Active chat throt-
         tling returns a LimitExceededException .

       If you use the ChatDurationInMinutes parameter and receive a 400 error,
       your account may not support the ability to configure custom chat dura-
       tions. For more information, contact Amazon Web Services Support.

       For  more information about chat, see Chat in the Amazon Connect Admin-
       istrator Guide .

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services

          tent chat, and for example use cases and how to configure for  them,
          see Enable persistent chat .

          RehydrationType -> (string)
              The  contactId that is used for rehydration depends on the rehy-

                terminated  past chat contact of the specified past ended chat
                session. To use this type, provide the initialContactId of the
                past  ended chat session in the sourceContactId field. In this
                type, Amazon Connect determines the most recent  chat  contact
                on  the  specified chat session that has ended, and uses it to
                start a persistent chat.

              o FROM_SEGMENT : Rehydrates a chat from the  past  chat  contact
                that is specified in the sourceContactId field.

              The actual contactId used for rehydration is provided in the re-
              sponse of this API.

          SourceContactId -> (string)

              started.

            "RehydrationType": "ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION"|"FROM_SEGMENT",
            "SourceContactId": "string"
          }

       --related-contact-id (string)
          The unique identifier for an Amazon Connect contact. This identifier
          is related to the chat starting.

              tentChat.

       --segment-attributes (map)
          A set of system defined key-value pairs stored on individual contact
          segments using an attribute map. The attributes are standard  Amazon
          Connect attributes. They can be accessed in flows.

          Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, -, and _.

          This  field  can  be  used  to  show  channel  subtype, such as con-
          nect:Guide .

          NOTE:
              The types  application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.message.interactive
              and    application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.message.interactive.re-
              sponse must be  present  in  the  SupportedMessagingContentTypes
              field  of  this  API in order to set SegmentAttributes as {"con-
              nect:Subtype": {"valueString" : "connect:Guide" }} .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              A value for a segment attribute. This is  structured  as  a  map
              where the key is valueString and the value is a string.

              ValueString -> (string)
                 The value of a segment attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=ValueString=string,KeyName2=ValueString=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "ValueString": "string"

            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
