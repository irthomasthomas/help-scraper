START-OUTBOUND-VOICE-CONTACT()                  START-OUTBOUND-VOICE-CONTACT()



NAME
       start-outbound-voice-contact -

DESCRIPTION
       Places  an  outbound call to a contact, and then initiates the flow. It
       performs the actions in the flow that's specified (in ContactFlowId ).

       Agents do not initiate the outbound API, which means that they  do  not
       dial the contact. If the flow places an outbound call to a contact, and
       then puts the contact in queue, the call is then routed to  the  agent,
       like any other inbound case.

       There is a 60-second dialing timeout for this operation. If the call is
       not connected after 60 seconds, it fails.

       NOTE:
          UK numbers with a 447 prefix are not allowed by default. Before  you
          can  dial  these  UK mobile numbers, you must submit a service quota
          increase request. For more information, see Amazon  Connect  Service
          Quotas in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

       NOTE:
          Campaign  calls  are  not  allowed by default. Before you can make a
          call with TrafficType = CAMPAIGN , you must submit a  service  quota
          increase request to the quota Amazon Connect campaigns .

          Panel (CCP). Contacts can have the following reference types at  the

          is not a supported reference type during voice contact creation.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Well-formed data on a contact, used by agents to complete a con-
              tact  request.  You  can have up to 4,096 UTF-8 bytes across all
              references for a contact.

              Value -> (string)
                 A valid value for the reference. For example, for a URL  ref-
                 erence,  a formatted URL that is displayed to an agent in the
                 Contact Control Panel (CCP).

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the reference. DATE must be of type  Epoch  time-

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "Value": "string",
                "Type": "URL"|"ATTACHMENT"|"CONTACT_ANALYSIS"|"NUMBER"|"STRING"|"DATE"|"EMAIL"|"EMAIL_MESSAGE",

            ...}

       --related-contact-id (string)
          The  contactId that is related to this contact. Linking voice, task,
          or chat by using RelatedContactID  copies  over  contact  attributes
          from the related contact to the new contact. All updates to user-de-
          fined attributes in the new contact are limited  to  the  individual
          contact  ID.  There are no limits to the number of contacts that can
          be linked by using RelatedContactId .

       --destination-phone-number (string)
          The phone number of the customer, in E.164 format.

       --contact-flow-id (string)
          The identifier of the flow for the outbound call. To  see  the  Con-
          tactFlowId  in  the  Amazon Connect admin website, on the navigation
          menu go to Routing , Contact Flows . Choose the flow.  On  the  flow
          page, under the name of the flow, choose Show additional flow infor-
          mation . The ContactFlowId is the last part of the ARN,  shown  here
          in bold:

          arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:in-
          stance/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/con-
          tact-flow/846ec553-a005-41c0-8341-xxxxxxxxxxxx

       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services
          SDK populates this field. For more  information  about  idempotency,
          see  Making  retries  safe with idempotent APIs . The token is valid
          for 7 days after creation. If a contact is already started, the con-
          tact ID is returned.

       --source-phone-number (string)
          The  phone  number  associated  with the Amazon Connect instance, in
          E.164 format. If you do not specify a source phone number, you  must
          specify a queue.

       --queue-id (string)
          The  queue for the call. If you specify a queue, the phone displayed
          for caller ID is the phone number specified in the queue. If you  do
          not  specify  a queue, the queue defined in the flow is used. If you
          do not specify a queue, you must specify a source phone number.

       --attributes (map)
          A custom key-value pair using an attribute map. The  attributes  are
          standard  Amazon  Connect  attributes,  and can be accessed in flows
          just like any other contact attributes.

          There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs per
          contact. Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, dash, and un-
          derscore characters.

       --answer-machine-detection-config (structure)
          Configuration of the answering machine detection for  this  outbound
          call.

          EnableAnswerMachineDetection -> (boolean)
              The  flag to indicate if answer machine detection analysis needs
              to be performed for a voice call. If set to true  ,  TrafficType
              must be set as CAMPAIGN .

          AwaitAnswerMachinePrompt -> (boolean)
              Wait for the answering machine prompt.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EnableAnswerMachineDetection=boolean,AwaitAnswerMachinePrompt=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EnableAnswerMachineDetection": true|false,
            "AwaitAnswerMachinePrompt": true|false
          }

       --campaign-id (string)
          The campaign identifier of the outbound communication.

       --traffic-type (string)
          Denotes the class of traffic. Calls with different traffic types are
          handled differently by Amazon Connect. The default value is  GENERAL
          .  Use CAMPAIGN if EnableAnswerMachineDetection is set to true . For
          all other cases, use GENERAL .

          o GENERAL

          o CAMPAIGN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
