DESCRIBE-INSTANCE()                                        DESCRIBE-INSTANCE()



NAME
       describe-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       This  API  is  in  preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to
       change.

       Returns the current state of  the  specified  instance  identifier.  It
       tracks the instance while it is being created and returns an error sta-
       tus, if applicable.

       If an instance is not created successfully, the instance status  reason
       field  returns details relevant to the reason. The instance in a failed
       state is returned only for 24 hours after the  CreateInstance  API  was
       invoked.

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
