OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --initial-contact-id (string)
          This is the contactId of the current contact that the  CreatePersis-
          tentContactAssociation API is being called from.

       --rehydration-type (string)
          The contactId chosen for rehydration depends on the type chosen.

          o ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION  :  Rehydrates  a  chat from the most recently
            terminated past chat contact of the specified past ended chat ses-
            sion.  To  use this type, provide the initialContactId of the past
            ended chat session in the sourceContactId  field.  In  this  type,
            Amazon Connect determines what the most recent chat contact on the
            past ended chat session and uses it to start a persistent chat.

          o FROM_SEGMENT : Rehydrates a chat from the specified past chat con-
            tact provided in the sourceContactId field.

          The  actual  contactId  used  for rehydration is provided in the re-
          sponse of this API.

          To illustrate how to use rehydration type,  consider  the  following
          example: A customer starts a chat session. Agent a1 accepts the chat
          and a conversation starts between the customer and  Agent  a1.  This
          first  contact creates a contact ID C1 . Agent a1 then transfers the
          chat to Agent a2. This creates another contact ID C2 . At this point
          Agent  a2 ends the chat. The customer is forwarded to the disconnect
          flow for a post chat survey that creates another contact ID C3 . Af-
          ter  the chat survey, the chat session ends. Later, the customer re-
          turns and wants to resume their past chat session.  At  this  point,
          the customer can have following use cases:

          o Use  Case 1 : The customer wants to continue the past chat session
            but they want to hide the post chat survey. For this they will use
            the following configuration:

            o Configuration

              o SourceContactId = "C2"

              o RehydrationType = "FROM_SEGMENT"

            o Expected behavior

              o This  starts a persistent chat session from the specified past
                ended contact (C2). Transcripts of past chat sessions  C2  and
                C1 are accessible in the current persistent chat session. Note
                that chat segment C3 is dropped from the persistent chat  ses-
                sion.

          o Use  Case 2 : The customer wants to continue the past chat session
            and see the transcript of the entire  past  engagement,  including
            the post chat survey. For this they will use the following config-
            uration:

            o Configuration

              o SourceContactId = "C1"

              o RehydrationType = "ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION"

            o Expected behavior

              o This starts a persistent chat session from the  most  recently
                ended chat contact (C3). Transcripts of past chat sessions C3,
                C2 and C1 are accessible in the current persistent  chat  ses-
                sion.

          Possible values:

          o ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION

          o FROM_SEGMENT

       --source-contact-id (string)
          The contactId from which a persistent chat session must be started.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services
          SDK  populates  this  field. For more information about idempotency,
          see Making retries safe with idempotent APIs .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

       ContinuedFromContactId -> (string)
          The  contactId from which a persistent chat session is started. This
          field is populated only for persistent chat.
