OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the Connect instance.

       --file-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the attached file resource.

       --url-expiry-in-seconds (integer)
          Optional  override  for  the expiry of the pre-signed S3 URL in sec-
          onds. The default value is 300.

       --associated-resource-arn (string)
          The resource to which the attached  file  is  (being)  uploaded  to.
          Cases are the only current supported resource.

          NOTE:
              This value must be a valid ARN.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
