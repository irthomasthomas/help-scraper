OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the  in-
          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --routing-profile-id (string)
          The identifier of the routing profile.

       --media-concurrencies (list)
          The  channels  that  agents  can handle in the Contact Control Panel
          (CCP).

          (structure)
              Contains information about which channels are supported, and how
              many contacts an agent can have on a channel simultaneously.

              Channel -> (string)
                 The  channels  that  agents can handle in the Contact Control
                 Panel (CCP).

              Concurrency -> (integer)
                 The number of contacts an agent can have on a channel  simul-
                 taneously.

                 Valid  Range for VOICE : Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of
                 1.

                 Valid Range for CHAT : Minimum value of 1. Maximum  value  of
                 10.

                 Valid  Range  for TASK : Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of
                 10.

              CrossChannelBehavior -> (structure)
                 Defines the cross-channel routing behavior for  each  channel
                 that  is  enabled for this Routing Profile. For example, this
                 allows you to offer an agent a different contact from another
                 channel when they are currently working with a contact from a
                 Voice channel.

                 BehaviorType -> (string)
                     Specifies the other channels that can  be  routed  to  an
                     agent handling their current channel.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Channel=string,Concurrency=integer,CrossChannelBehavior={BehaviorType=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Channel": "VOICE"|"CHAT"|"TASK",
              "Concurrency": integer,
              "CrossChannelBehavior": {
                "BehaviorType": "ROUTE_CURRENT_CHANNEL_ONLY"|"ROUTE_ANY_CHANNEL"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --output (string)
