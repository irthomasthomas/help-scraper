OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --name (string)
          The name of the routing profile. Must not be more than  127  charac-
          ters.

       --description (string)
          Description  of the routing profile. Must not be more than 250 char-
          acters.

       --default-outbound-queue-id (string)
          The default outbound queue for the routing profile.

       --queue-configs (list)
          The inbound queues associated with the routing profile. If no  queue
          is added, the agent can make only outbound calls.

          The limit of 10 array members applies to the maximum number of Rout-
          ingProfileQueueConfig objects that can be passed during  a  CreateR-
          outingProfile  API  request.  It  is  different from the quota of 50
          queues per routing profile per instance that  is  listed  in  Amazon
          Connect service quotas .

          (structure)
              Contains  information about the queue and channel for which pri-
              ority and delay can be set.

              QueueReference -> (structure)
                 Contains information about a queue resource.

                 QueueId -> (string)
                     The identifier for the queue.

                 Channel -> (string)
                     The channels agents can handle  in  the  Contact  Control
                     Panel (CCP) for this routing profile.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The  order in which contacts are to be handled for the queue.
                 For more information, see Queues: priority and delay .

              Delay -> (integer)
                 The delay, in seconds, a contact should be in the  queue  be-
                 fore they are routed to an available agent. For more informa-
                 tion, see Queues: priority and delay in  the  Amazon  Connect
                 Administrator Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          QueueReference={QueueId=string,Channel=string},Priority=integer,Delay=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

                "Channel": "VOICE"|"CHAT"|"TASK"
              },
              "Priority": integer,
              "Delay": integer

            ...
          ]

       --media-concurrencies (list)
          The  channels  that  agents  can handle in the Contact Control Panel
          (CCP) for this routing profile.

          (structure)
              Contains information about which channels are supported, and how
              many contacts an agent can have on a channel simultaneously.

              Channel -> (string)
                 The  channels  that  agents can handle in the Contact Control
                 Panel (CCP).

              Concurrency -> (integer)
                 The number of contacts an agent can have on a channel  simul-
                 taneously.

                 Valid  Range for VOICE : Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of

                 Defines the cross-channel routing behavior for  each  channel
                 that  is  enabled for this Routing Profile. For example, this
                 allows you to offer an agent a different contact from another
                 channel when they are currently working with a contact from a
                 Voice channel.

                 BehaviorType -> (string)
                     Specifies the other channels that can  be  routed  to  an
                     agent handling their current channel.

              "CrossChannelBehavior": {
                "BehaviorType": "ROUTE_CURRENT_CHANNEL_ONLY"|"ROUTE_ANY_CHANNEL"
              }

            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)
          The  tags  used  to  organize, track, or control access for this re-
          source. For example, { "tags": {"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"} }.

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --agent-availability-timer (string)
          Whether agents with this routing profile will have their routing or-
          der  calculated  based  on  time since their last inbound contact or
          longest idle time .

          Possible values:

          o TIME_SINCE_LAST_ACTIVITY

          o TIME_SINCE_LAST_INBOUND

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
