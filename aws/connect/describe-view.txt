DESCRIBE-VIEW()                                                DESCRIBE-VIEW()



NAME
       describe-view -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  view for the specified Amazon Connect instance and view
       identifier.

       The view identifier can be supplied as a ViewId or ARN.
          $SAVED needs to be supplied if a view is unpublished.

       The view identifier can contain an  optional  qualifier,  for  example,
       <view-id>:$SAVED  , which is either an actual version number or an Ama-
       zon Connect managed qualifier $SAVED | $LATEST . If it is not supplied,
       then  $LATEST is assumed for customer managed views and an error is re-
       turned if there is no published content available. Version 1 is assumed
       for Amazon Web Services managed views.

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --view-id (string)
          The ViewId of the view. This must be an ARN for Amazon Web  Services
          managed views.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.
