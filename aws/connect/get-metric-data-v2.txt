GET-METRIC-DATA-V2()                                      GET-METRIC-DATA-V2()



NAME
       get-metric-data-v2 -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets metric data from the specified Amazon Connect instance.
          GetMetricDataV2 offers more features than GetMetricData , the previ-
          ous version of this API. It has new metrics, offers filtering  at  a
          metric  level,  and  offers  the ability to filter and group data by
          channels, queues, routing profiles, agents, and agent hierarchy lev-
          els. It can retrieve historical data for the last 3 months, at vary-
          ing intervals. It does not support agent queues.

       For a description of the historical metrics that are supported by  Get-
       MetricDataV2  and GetMetricData , see Historical metrics definitions in
       the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.  This  includes  the
          instanceId an Amazon Connect instance.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format, at which to start the re-
          porting interval for the retrieval of historical metrics  data.  The
          time  must  be before the end time timestamp. The start and end time
          depends on the IntervalPeriod selected. By default  the  time  range
          between start and end time is 35 days. Historical metrics are avail-
          able for 3 months.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format, at which to  end  the  re-
          porting  interval  for the retrieval of historical metrics data. The
          time must be later than the start time timestamp. It cannot be later
          than the current timestamp.

       --interval (structure)
          The interval period and timezone to apply to returned metrics.

          o IntervalPeriod  :  An  aggregated grouping applied to request met-
            rics. Valid IntervalPeriod values are: FIFTEEN_MIN | THIRTY_MIN  |
            HOUR | DAY | WEEK | TOTAL .  For example, if IntervalPeriod is se-
            lected THIRTY_MIN , StartTime and EndTime differs by 1  day,  then
            Amazon  Connect returns 48 results in the response. Each result is
            aggregated by the THIRTY_MIN period. By default Amazon Connect ag-
            gregates  results based on the TOTAL interval period.  The follow-
            ing list describes restrictions on StartTime and EndTime based  on
            which IntervalPeriod is requested.

            o FIFTEEN_MIN  : The difference between StartTime and EndTime must
              be less than 3 days.

            o THIRTY_MIN : The difference between StartTime and  EndTime  must
              be less than 3 days.

            o HOUR : The difference between StartTime and EndTime must be less
              than 3 days.

            o DAY : The difference between StartTime and EndTime must be  less
              than 35 days.

            o WEEK : The difference between StartTime and EndTime must be less
              than 35 days.

            o TOTAL : The difference between StartTime  and  EndTime  must  be
              less than 35 days.

          o TimeZone : The timezone applied to requested metrics.

          TimeZone -> (string)
              The timezone applied to requested metrics.

          IntervalPeriod -> (string)
                 IntervalPeriod  :  An  aggregated grouping applied to request
                 metrics.  Valid  IntervalPeriod  values  are:  FIFTEEN_MIN  |
                 THIRTY_MIN | HOUR | DAY | WEEK | TOTAL .

              For  example,  if IntervalPeriod is selected THIRTY_MIN , Start-
              Time and EndTime differs by 1 day, then Amazon  Connect  returns
              48  results  in  the  response. Each result is aggregated by the
              THIRTY_MIN period. By default Amazon Connect aggregates  results
              based on the TOTAL interval period.

              The  following list describes restrictions on StartTime and End-
              Time based on what IntervalPeriod is requested.

              o FIFTEEN_MIN : The difference  between  StartTime  and  EndTime
                must be less than 3 days.

              o THIRTY_MIN : The difference between StartTime and EndTime must
                be less than 3 days.

              o HOUR : The difference between StartTime and  EndTime  must  be
                less than 3 days.

              o DAY  :  The  difference  between StartTime and EndTime must be
                less than 35 days.

              o WEEK : The difference between StartTime and  EndTime  must  be
                less than 35 days.

              o TOTAL  :  The difference between StartTime and EndTime must be
                less than 35 days.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TimeZone": "string",
            "IntervalPeriod": "FIFTEEN_MIN"|"THIRTY_MIN"|"HOUR"|"DAY"|"WEEK"|"TOTAL"
          }

       --filters (list)
          The filters to apply to returned metrics. You can filter on the fol-
          lowing resources:

          o Agents

          o Campaigns

          o Channels

          o Feature

          o Queues

          o Routing profiles

          o Routing step expression

          o User hierarchy groups

          At  least  one  filter must be passed from queues, routing profiles,
          agents, or user hierarchy groups.

          For metrics for outbound campaigns analytics, you can also use  cam-
          paigns to satisfy at least one filter requirement.

          To filter by phone number, see Create a historical metrics report in
          the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

          Note the following limits:

          o Filter keys : A maximum of 5 filter keys are supported in a single
            request.  Valid  filter  keys: AGENT | AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_ONE |
            AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_TWO    |    AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_THREE    |
            AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_FOUR  | AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_FIVE | ANSWER-

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 231)
            Inline substitution_reference start-string without end-string.

          o Filter  values : A maximum of 100 filter values are supported in a
            single request. VOICE, CHAT, and TASK are  valid  filterValue  for
            the  CHANNEL  filter  key. They do not count towards limitation of
            100 filter values. For example, a GetMetricDataV2 request can fil-
            ter  by  50 queues, 35 agents, and 15 routing profiles for a total
            of 100  filter  values,  along  with  3  channel  filters.    con-
            tact_lens_conversational_analytics  is a valid filterValue for the
            FEATURE filter key. It is available only to contacts  analyzed  by
            Contact Lens conversational analytics.  connect:Chat , connect:SMS
            , connect:Telephony , and connect:WebRTC are valid filterValue ex-
            amples  (not  exhaustive)  for  the contact/segmentAttributes/con-
            nect:Subtype filter key.  ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION is a valid  fil-
            ter key with a filter value up to 3000 length. This filter is case
            and order sensitive. JSON string fields must be sorted in  ascend-
            ing  order  and  JSON  array  order  should be kept as is.  Q_CON-
            NECT_ENABLED . TRUE and FALSE are the only valid filterValues  for
            the Q_CONNECT_ENABLED filter key.

            o TRUE  includes all contacts that had Amazon Q in Connect enabled
              as part of the flow.

            o FALSE includes all contacts that did not have Amazon Q  in  Con-
              nect enabled as part of the flow

          This filter is available only for contact record-driven metrics.
              Campaign  ARNs  are  valid  filterValues for the CAMPAIGN filter
              key.

          (structure)
              Contains the filter to apply when retrieving  metrics  with  the
              GetMetricDataV2 API.

              FilterKey -> (string)
                 The key to use for filtering data. For example, QUEUE , ROUT-
                 ING_PROFILE, AGENT , CHANNEL  ,  AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_ONE  ,
                 AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_TWO   ,  AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_THREE  ,
                 AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_FOUR  ,  AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_FIVE   .
                 There must be at least 1 key and a maximum 5 keys.

              FilterValues -> (list)
                 The  identifiers  to  use for filtering data. For example, if
                 you have a filter key of QUEUE , you would add queue  IDs  or
                 ARNs in FilterValues .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            }
            ...
          ]

       --groupings (list)
          The  grouping applied to the metrics that are returned. For example,
          when results are grouped by queue, the metrics returned are  grouped
          by queue. The values that are returned apply to the metrics for each
          queue. They are not aggregated for all queues.

          If no grouping is specified, a summary of all metrics is returned.

          Valid grouping keys: AGENT | AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_ONE | AGENT_HIER-
          ARCHY_LEVEL_TWO   |   AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_THREE   |  AGENT_HIERAR-

          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
