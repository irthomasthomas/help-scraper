TRANSFER-CONTACT()                                          TRANSFER-CONTACT()



NAME
       transfer-contact -

DESCRIPTION
       Transfers contacts from one agent or queue to another agent or queue at
       any point after a contact is created. You can transfer a contact to an-
       other  queue  by providing the contact flow which orchestrates the con-
       tact to the destination queue. This gives you more control over contact
       handling  and  helps  you  adhere  to the service level agreement (SLA)
       guaranteed to your customers.

       Note the following requirements:

       o Transfer is supported for only TASK contacts.

       o Do not use both QueueId and UserId in the same call.

       o The following contact flow types are supported: Inbound contact flow,
         Transfer to agent flow, and Transfer to queue flow.

       o The TransferContact API can be called only on active contacts.

       o A contact cannot be transferred more than 11 times.

SYNOPSIS
            transfer-contact
          --instance-id <value>
          --contact-id <value>
          [--queue-id <value>]
          [--user-id <value>]
          --contact-flow-id <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact in this instance of Amazon Connect

       --queue-id (string)
          The identifier for the queue.

       --user-id (string)
          The identifier for the user.

       --contact-flow-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact flow.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
