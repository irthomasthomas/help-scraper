DESCRIBE-PHONE-NUMBER()                                DESCRIBE-PHONE-NUMBER()



NAME
       describe-phone-number -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  details and status of a phone number thats claimed to your Amazon
       Connect instance or traffic distribution group.

       WARNING:
          If the number is claimed to a traffic distribution  group,  and  you
          are calling in the Amazon Web Services Region where the traffic dis-
          tribution group was created, you can use either a phone  number  ARN
          or  UUID value for the PhoneNumberId URI request parameter. However,
          if the number is claimed to a traffic distribution group and you are
          calling this API in the alternate Amazon Web Services Region associ-
          ated with the traffic distribution group, you must  provide  a  full
          phone  number  ARN. If a UUID is provided in this scenario, you will
          receive a ResourceNotFoundException .

OPTIONS
       --phone-number-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the phone number.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

              A unique identifier for the phone number.

          PhoneNumberArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the phone number.

          PhoneNumber -> (string)
              The phone number. Phone numbers are formatted [+] [country code]

              The description of the phone number.

          TargetArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for Amazon Connect instances or
              traffic distribution groups that phone number inbound traffic is
              routed through.

          InstanceId -> (string)
              The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance that phone numbers
              are claimed to. You can find the instance ID in the  Amazon  Re-

          Tags -> (map)
              The tags used to organize, track, or control access for this re-
              source.    For    example,    {    "Tags":     {"key1":"value1",
              "key2":"value2"} }.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          PhoneNumberStatus -> (structure)
              The status of the phone number.

              o CLAIMED     means    the    previous    ClaimPhoneNumber    or
                UpdatePhoneNumber operation succeeded.

              o IN_PROGRESS means a ClaimPhoneNumber , UpdatePhoneNumber ,  or
                UpdatePhoneNumberMetadata  operation  is still in progress and
                has not yet completed. You can call DescribePhoneNumber  at  a
                later time to verify if the previous operation has completed.

              o FAILED   indicates   that  the  previous  ClaimPhoneNumber  or
                UpdatePhoneNumber operation has failed. It will include a mes-
                sage  indicating  the  failure  reason.  A common reason for a
                failure may be that the TargetArn value you  are  claiming  or
                updating  a  phone  number  to  has reached its limit of total
                claimed numbers. If you received a FAILED status from a Claim-
                PhoneNumber  API  call, you have one day to retry claiming the
                phone number before the number is released back to the  inven-
                tory for other customers to claim.

              NOTE:
                 You  will not be billed for the phone number during the 1-day
                 period if number claiming fails.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status.

              Message -> (string)
                 The status message.

          SourcePhoneNumberArn -> (string)
              The claimed phone number ARN that was previously  imported  from
              the  external  service,  such  as Amazon Pinpoint. If it is from
              Amazon Pinpoint, it looks like the ARN of the phone number  that
              was imported from Amazon Pinpoint.
