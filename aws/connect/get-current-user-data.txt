OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the  in-
          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --filters (structure)
          The filters to apply to returned user data. You can filter up to the
          following limits:

          o User hierarchy groups: 1

          The user data is retrieved for only the  specified  values/resources
          in  the  filter.  A maximum of one filter can be passed from queues,
          routing profiles, agents, and user hierarchy groups.

          Currently tagging is only supported on the resources that are passed
          in the filter.

              A filter for the user data based on the contact information that
              is associated to the user. It contains a list of contact states.

              ContactStates -> (list)
                 A list of up to 9 contact states .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Queues=string,string,ContactFilter={ContactStates=[string,string]},RoutingProfiles=string,string,Agents=string,string,UserHierarchyGroups=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Queues": ["string", ...],
            "ContactFilter": {
              "ContactStates": ["INCOMING"|"PENDING"|"CONNECTING"|"CONNECTED"|"CONNECTED_ONHOLD"|"MISSED"|"ERROR"|"ENDED"|"REJECTED", ...]
            },
            "RoutingProfiles": ["string", ...],
            "Agents": ["string", ...],
            "UserHierarchyGroups": ["string", ...]
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous  response  in  the next request to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
