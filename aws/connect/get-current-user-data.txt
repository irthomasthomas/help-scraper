OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the  in-
          stanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --filters (structure)
          Filters  up to 100 Queues , or up to 9 ContactStates . The user data
          is retrieved only for those users who are associated with the queues
          and have contacts that are in the specified ContactState .

          Queues -> (list)
              Contains  information  about  a queue resource for which metrics
              are returned.

              (string)

          ContactFilter -> (structure)
              A filter for the user data based on the contact information that
              is associated to the user. It contains a list of contact states.

              ContactStates -> (list)
                 A list of up to 9 contact states .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Queues=string,string,ContactFilter={ContactStates=[string,string]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Queues": ["string", ...],
            "ContactFilter": {
              "ContactStates": ["INCOMING"|"PENDING"|"CONNECTING"|"CONNECTED"|"CONNECTED_ONHOLD"|"MISSED"|"ERROR"|"ENDED"|"REJECTED", ...]
            }
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous response in the next request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
