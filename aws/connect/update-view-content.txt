NAME
       update-view-content -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the view content of the given view identifier in the specified
       Amazon Connect instance.

       It performs content validation if Status is set to SAVED  and  performs
       full  content  validation if Status is PUBLISHED . Note that the $SAVED
       alias' content will always be updated, but the $LATEST  alias'  content
       will only be updated if Status is PUBLISHED .

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --view-id (string)
          The identifier of the view. Both ViewArn and ViewId can be used.

       --status (string)
          Indicates the view status as either SAVED or PUBLISHED  .  The  PUB-
          LISHED status will initiate validation on the content.

          Possible values:

          o PUBLISHED

          o SAVED

       --content (structure)
          View  content  containing all content necessary to render a view ex-
          cept for runtime input data and the runtime input schema,  which  is
          auto-generated by this operation.

          The total uncompressed content has a maximum file size of 400kB.

          Template -> (string)
              The view template representing the structure of the view.

          Actions -> (list)
              A list of possible actions from the view.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Template=string,Actions=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Template": "string",
            "Actions": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)
