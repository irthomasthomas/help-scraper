OPTIONS
       --traffic-distribution-group-id (string)
          The identifier of the traffic distribution group. This can be the ID
          or the ARN if the API is being called in the Region where the  traf-
          fic  distribution group was created. The ARN must be provided if the
          call is from the replicated Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

              the traffic distribution group was created. The ARN must be pro-
              vided if the call is from the replicated Region.

          Arn -> (string)

              group.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the traffic distribution group.

              o CREATION_IN_PROGRESS         means         the        previous
                CreateTrafficDistributionGroup operation is still in  progress
                and has not yet completed.

              o ACTIVE means the previous CreateTrafficDistributionGroup oper-
                ation has succeeded.

              o CREATION_FAILED     indicates      that      the      previous
                CreateTrafficDistributionGroup operation has failed.

              o PENDING_DELETION          means          the          previous
                DeleteTrafficDistributionGroup operation is still in  progress
                and has not yet completed.

              o DELETION_FAILED           means          the          previous
                DeleteTrafficDistributionGroup operation has failed.

              o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS         means         the          previous
                UpdateTrafficDistributionGroup  operation is still in progress
                and has not yet completed.

          Tags -> (map)
              The tags used to organize, track, or control access for this re-
              source.     For    example,    {    "tags":    {"key1":"value1",
              "key2":"value2"} }.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          IsDefault -> (boolean)
              Whether this is the default traffic distribution  group  created
              during  instance  replication.  The default traffic distribution
              group cannot be deleted  by  the  DeleteTrafficDistributionGroup
              API.  The  default traffic distribution group is deleted as part
              of the process for deleting a replica.

              NOTE:
                 You can change the SignInConfig  only  for  a  default  Traf-
                 ficDistributionGroup  . If you call UpdateTrafficDistribution
                 with a modified SignInConfig and a non-default TrafficDistri-
                 butionGroup , an InvalidRequestException is returned.
