OPTIONS
       --attributes (map)
          A custom key-value pair using an attribute map. The  attributes  are
          standard  Amazon  Connect  attributes,  and can be accessed in flows
          just like any other contact attributes.

          There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs per
          contact.  Attribute  keys  can  include  only alphanumeric, -, and _
          characters.

          see Making retries safe with idempotent APIs .

       the string will be taken literally.
