OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)

          idempotency of the request.

       --scheduled-time (timestamp)
          The  timestamp, in Unix Epoch seconds format, at which to start run-
          ning the inbound contact flow. The scheduled time cannot be  in  the

       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContactId -> (string)
          The identifier of this contact within the Amazon Connect instance.
