OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --references (map)
          Well-formed  data  on  contact,  shown  to agents on Contact Control
          Panel (CCP).

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Well-formed data on a contact, used by agents to complete a con-
              tact  request.  You  can have up to 4,096 UTF-8 bytes across all
              references for a contact.

              Value -> (string)
                 A valid value for the reference. For example, for a URL  ref-
                 erence,  a formatted URL that is displayed to an agent in the
                 Contact Control Panel (CCP).

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the reference.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=Value=string,Type=string,KeyName2=Value=string,Type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "Value": "string",
                "Type": "URL"|"ATTACHMENT"|"NUMBER"|"STRING"|"DATE"|"EMAIL"
              }
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
