CREATE-QUEUE()                                                  CREATE-QUEUE()



NAME
       create-queue -

DESCRIPTION
       This  API  is  in  preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to
       change.

       Creates a new queue for the specified Amazon Connect instance.

       WARNING:

          o If the phone number is claimed to  a  traffic  distribution  group
            that was created in the same Region as the Amazon Connect instance
            where you are calling this API, then you can use a full phone num-
            ber  ARN  or a UUID for OutboundCallerIdNumberId . However, if the
            phone number is claimed to a traffic distribution group that is in
            one  Region,  and you are calling this API from an instance in an-
            other Amazon Web Services Region that is associated with the traf-
            fic  distribution group, you must provide a full phone number ARN.
            If a UUID is provided in this scenario, you  will  receive  a  Re-
            sourceNotFoundException .

          o Only use the phone number ARN format that doesn't contain instance
            in      the      path,       for       example,       arn:aws:con-
            nect:us-east-1:1234567890:phone-number/uuid . This is the same ARN
            format that is returned when you call the ListPhoneNumbersV2 API.

          o If you plan to use IAM policies to allow/deny access to  this  API
            for  phone  number  resources  claimed  to  a traffic distribution
            group, see Allow or Deny queue API actions for phone numbers in  a
            replica Region .

       --description (string)
          The description of the queue.

       --outbound-caller-config (structure)
          The outbound caller ID name, number, and outbound whisper flow.

              The outbound whisper flow to be used during an outbound call.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OutboundCallerIdName=string,OutboundCallerIdNumberId=string,OutboundFlowId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "OutboundCallerIdName": "string",
            "OutboundCallerIdNumberId": "string",
            "OutboundFlowId": "string"
          }

       --outbound-email-config (structure)
          The outbound email address ID for a specified queue.

          OutboundEmailAddressId -> (string)
              The identifier of the email address.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OutboundEmailAddressId=string

       JSON Syntax:

            "OutboundEmailAddressId": "string"
          }

       --hours-of-operation-id (string)
          The identifier for the hours of operation.

       --max-contacts (integer)
          The maximum number of contacts that can be in the queue before it is
          considered full.

       --quick-connect-ids (list)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON

       the string will be taken literally.

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
