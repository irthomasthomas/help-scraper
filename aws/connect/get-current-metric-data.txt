OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --filters (structure)
          The filters to apply to returned metrics. You can filter up  to  the
          following limits:

          o Queues: 100

          o Routing profiles: 100

          o Channels: 3 (VOICE, CHAT, and TASK channels are supported.)

          o RoutingStepExpressions: 50

          Metric  data is retrieved only for the resources associated with the
          queues or routing profiles, and by any channels included in the fil-
          ter.  (You cannot filter by both queue AND routing profile.) You can
          include both resource IDs and resource ARNs in the same request.

          When using the RoutingStepExpression filter, you need  to  pass  ex-
          actly  one QueueId . The filter is also case sensitive so when using
          the RoutingStepExpression filter, grouping  by  ROUTING_STEP_EXPRES-
          SION is required.

          Currently tagging is only supported on the resources that are passed
          in the filter.

          Queues -> (list)
              The queues to use to filter the metrics. You should  specify  at
              least  one  queue, and can specify up to 100 queues per request.
              The GetCurrentMetricsData API in  particular  requires  a  queue
              when you include a Filter in your request.

              (string)

          Channels -> (list)
              The channel to use to filter the metrics.

              (string)

          RoutingProfiles -> (list)
              A list of up to 100 routing profile IDs or ARNs.

              (string)

          RoutingStepExpressions -> (list)
              A  list of expressions as a filter, in which an expression is an
              object of a step in a routing criteria.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Queues=string,string,Channels=string,string,RoutingProfiles=string,string,RoutingStepExpressions=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Queues": ["string", ...],
            "Channels": ["VOICE"|"CHAT"|"TASK"|"EMAIL", ...],
            "RoutingProfiles": ["string", ...],
            "RoutingStepExpressions": ["string", ...]
          }

       --groupings (list)
          The grouping applied to the  metrics  returned.  For  example,  when
          grouped  by  QUEUE , the metrics returned apply to each queue rather
          than aggregated for all queues.

          o If you group by CHANNEL , you should include  a  Channels  filter.
            VOICE, CHAT, and TASK channels are supported.

          o If  you group by ROUTING_PROFILE , you must include either a queue
            or routing profile filter. In addition, a routing  profile  filter
            is  required  for metrics CONTACTS_SCHEDULED , CONTACTS_IN_QUEUE ,
            and OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE .

          o If no Grouping is included in the request, a summary of metrics is
            returned.

          o When  using  the  RoutingStepExpression  filter,  group  by  ROUT-
            ING_STEP_EXPRESSION is required.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            QUEUE
            CHANNEL
            ROUTING_PROFILE
            ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION

       --current-metrics (list)
          The metrics to retrieve. Specify the name and unit for each  metric.
          The  following  metrics  are available. For a description of all the
          metrics, see Real-time Metrics Definitions in the Amazon Connect Ad-
          ministrator Guide .
              AGENTS_AFTER_CONTACT_WORK

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: ACW
              AGENTS_AVAILABLE

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: Available
              AGENTS_ERROR

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: Error
              AGENTS_NON_PRODUCTIVE

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: NPT (Non-Productive Time)
              AGENTS_ON_CALL

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: On contact
              AGENTS_ON_CONTACT

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: On contact
              AGENTS_ONLINE

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: Online
              AGENTS_STAFFED

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: Staffed
              CONTACTS_IN_QUEUE

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: In queue
              CONTACTS_SCHEDULED

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: Scheduled
              OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE

          Unit: SECONDS

          When  you use groupings, Unit says SECONDS and the Value is returned
          in SECONDS.

          When you do not use groupings, Unit says SECONDS but  the  Value  is
          returned  in  MILLISECONDS.  For example, if you get a response like
          this:
              { "Metric": { "Name": "OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE", "Unit": "SECONDS" },
              "Value": 24113.0 }

          The actual OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE is 24 seconds.

          When  the filter RoutingStepExpression is used, this metric is still
          calculated from enqueue time. For example, if  a  contact  that  has
          been queued under <Expression 1> for 10 seconds has expired and <Ex-
          pression 2> becomes active, then OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE for  this  queue
          will be counted starting from 10, not 0.

          Name in real-time metrics report: Oldest
              SLOTS_ACTIVE

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: Active

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: Availability
              (structure)

              Contains information about a real-time metric. For a description
              of each metric, see Real-time Metrics Definitions in the  Amazon
              Connect Administrator Guide .

            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous response in the next request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

          The  token expires after 5 minutes from the time it is created. Sub-
          sequent requests that use the token must use the same request param-
          eters as the request that generated the token.

       --sort-criteria (list)
          The way to sort the resulting response based on metrics. You can en-
          ter one sort criteria. By default  resources  are  sorted  based  on

            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
