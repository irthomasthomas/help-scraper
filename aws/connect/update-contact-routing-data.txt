UPDATE-CONTACT-ROUTING-DATA()                    UPDATE-CONTACT-ROUTING-DATA()



NAME
       update-contact-routing-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  routing  priority  and  age  on the contact (QueuePriority and
       QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds ). These properties can be used to  change
       a customer's position in the queue. For example, you can move a contact
       to the back of the queue by setting a lower routing  priority  relative
       to  other  contacts in queue; or you can move a contact to the front of
       the queue by increasing the routing age which  will  make  the  contact
       look    artificially   older   and   therefore   higher   up   in   the
       first-in-first-out routing order. Note that adjusting the  routing  age
       of  a  contact  affects  only its position in queue, and not its actual
       queue wait time as reported through metrics. These properties can  also
       be updated by using the Set routing priority / age flow block .

       NOTE:
          Either  QueuePriority or QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds should be pro-
          vided within the request body, but not both.

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the  in-
          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact in this instance of Amazon Connect.

       --queue-time-adjustment-seconds (integer)
          The  number of seconds to add or subtract from the contact's routing
          age. Contacts are routed to agents on a first-come, first-serve  ba-
          sis. This means that changing their amount of time in queue compared
          to others also changes their position in queue.

       --queue-priority (long)
          Priority of the contact in the queue. The default priority  for  new
          contacts  is  5. You can raise the priority of a contact compared to
          other contacts in the queue by assigning  them  a  higher  priority,
          such as 1 or 2.

       --routing-criteria (structure)
          Updates the routing criteria on the contact. These properties can be
          used to change how a contact is routed within the queue.

          Steps -> (list)
              When Amazon Connect does not find an available agent meeting the
              requirements  in  a  step for a given step duration, the routing
              criteria will move on to the next step sequentially until a join
              is  completed  with  an agent. When all steps are exhausted, the
              contact will be offered to any agent in the queue.

              (structure)
                 Step defines the list of agents to be routed or  route  based
                 on  the agent requirements such as ProficiencyLevel, Name, or
                 Value.

                     DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The number of seconds that the contact will be  routed
                        only  to  agents matching this routing step, if expiry
                        was configured for this routing step.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
