CLAIM-PHONE-NUMBER()                                      CLAIM-PHONE-NUMBER()



NAME
       claim-phone-number -

DESCRIPTION
       Claims  an  available  phone  number to your Amazon Connect instance or
       traffic distribution group. You can call this API only in the same Ama-
       zon  Web  Services  Region where the Amazon Connect instance or traffic
       distribution group was created.

       For more information about how to use this operation, see Claim a phone
       number  in your country and Claim phone numbers to traffic distribution
       groups in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

       WARNING:
          You can call the SearchAvailablePhoneNumbers API for available phone
          numbers that you can claim. Call the DescribePhoneNumber API to ver-
          ify the status of a previous ClaimPhoneNumber operation.

       If you plan to claim and release numbers frequently during a 30 day pe-
       riod, contact us for a service quota exception. Otherwise, it is possi-
       ble you will be blocked from claiming and releasing  any  more  numbers
       until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired.

       By  default you can claim and release up to 200% of your maximum number
       of active phone numbers during any 30 day period. If you claim and  re-
       lease  phone  numbers using the UI or API during a rolling 30 day cycle
       that exceeds 200% of your phone number service level quota, you will be
       blocked  from  claiming  any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest
       number released has expired.

       For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level
       quota  of  99  phone  numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99,
       claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the  200%  limit.
       At  that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you
       open an Amazon Web Services support ticket.

OPTIONS
       --target-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for Amazon Connect instances or traf-
          fic  distribution groups that phone number inbound traffic is routed
          through. You must enter InstanceId or TargetArn .

       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance that phone numbers are
          claimed to. You can find the instance ID in the Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN) of the instance. You must enter InstanceId or TargetArn .

       --phone-number (string)
          The phone number you want to claim. Phone numbers are formatted  [+]
          [country code] [subscriber number including area code] .

       --phone-number-description (string)
          The description of the phone number.

       --tags (map)
          The  tags  used  to  organize, track, or control access for this re-
          source. For example, { "Tags": {"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"} }.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services
          SDK populates this field. For more  information  about  idempotency,
          see Making retries safe with idempotent APIs .

          Pattern:
          ^[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{12}$

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
