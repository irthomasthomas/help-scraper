START-CONTACT-RECORDING()                            START-CONTACT-RECORDING()



NAME
       start-contact-recording -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts recording the contact:

       o If  the  API  is  called  before  the agent joins the call, recording
         starts when the agent joins the call.

       o If the API is called after the agent joins the call, recording starts
         at the time of the API call.

       StartContactRecording  is  a  one-time  action. For example, if you use
       StopContactRecording to stop recording an ongoing call, you  can't  use
       StartContactRecording  to restart it. For scenarios where the recording
       has started and you want to suspend and resume it, such  as  when  col-
       lecting  sensitive information (for example, a credit card number), use
       SuspendContactRecording and ResumeContactRecording.

       You can use this API to override the recording behavior  configured  in
       the Set recording behavior block.

       Only voice recordings are supported at this time.

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact.

       --initial-contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact. This is the identifier of the contact
          associated with the first interaction with the contact center.

       --voice-recording-configuration (structure)
          The person being recorded.

          VoiceRecordingTrack -> (string)
              Identifies which track is being recorded.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VoiceRecordingTrack=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VoiceRecordingTrack": "FROM_AGENT"|"TO_AGENT"|"ALL"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)
