LIST-PHONE-NUMBERS-V2()                                LIST-PHONE-NUMBERS-V2()



NAME
       list-phone-numbers-v2 -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  phone numbers claimed to your Amazon Connect instance or traffic
       distribution group. If the provided TargetArn is a traffic distribution
       group,  you can call this API in both Amazon Web Services Regions asso-
       ciated with traffic distribution group.

       For more information about phone numbers, see Set Up Phone Numbers  for
       Your Contact Center in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

       NOTE:

          o When  given  an  instance ARN, ListPhoneNumbersV2 returns only the
            phone numbers claimed to the instance.

          o When given a traffic distribution group ARN ListPhoneNumbersV2 re-
            turns  only  the phone numbers claimed to the traffic distribution
            group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-phone-numbers-v2 is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ListPhoneNumbersSummaryList

OPTIONS
       --target-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for Amazon Connect instances or traf-
          fic distribution groups that phone number inbound traffic is  routed
          through.  If  both  TargetArn and InstanceId input are not provided,
          this API lists numbers claimed to all the Amazon  Connect  instances
          belonging  to your account in the same Amazon Web Services Region as
          the request.

       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance that phone numbers are
          claimed to. You can find the instance ID in the Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN) of the instance. If both TargetArn and InstanceId are not pro-
          vided,  this API lists numbers claimed to all the Amazon Connect in-
          stances belonging to your account in the same AWS Region as the  re-
          quest.

       --phone-number-country-codes (list)
          The ISO country code.

       --phone-number-types (list)
          The type of phone number.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            TOLL_FREE
            DID
            UIFN
            SHARED
            THIRD_PARTY_TF
            THIRD_PARTY_DID
            SHORT_CODE

       --phone-number-prefix (string)
          The  prefix  of  the phone number. If provided, it must contain + as
          part of the country code.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the token for the next  set
          of results.

       ListPhoneNumbersSummaryList -> (list)
          Information  about phone numbers that have been claimed to your Ama-
          zon Connect instances or traffic distribution groups.

          (structure)
              Information about phone numbers that have been claimed  to  your
              Amazon Connect instance or traffic distribution group.

              PhoneNumberId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the phone number.

              PhoneNumberArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the phone number.

              PhoneNumber -> (string)
                 The  phone  number.  Phone numbers are formatted [+] [country
                 code] [subscriber number including area code] .

              PhoneNumberCountryCode -> (string)
                 The ISO country code.

              PhoneNumberType -> (string)
                 The type of phone number.

              TargetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for Amazon  Connect  instances
                 or  traffic  distribution  groups  that  phone number inbound
                 traffic is routed through.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance that phone num-
                 bers are claimed to. You can find the instance ID in the Ama-
                 zon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

              PhoneNumberDescription -> (string)
                 The description of the phone number.

              SourcePhoneNumberArn -> (string)
                 The claimed phone number ARN  that  was  previously  imported
                 from  the external service, such as Amazon Pinpoint. If it is
                 from Amazon Pinpoint, it looks like the ARN of the phone num-
                 ber that was imported from Amazon Pinpoint.
