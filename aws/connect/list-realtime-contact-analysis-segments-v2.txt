OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact in this instance of Amazon Connect.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous  response  in  the next request to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --output-type (string)
          The Contact Lens output type to be returned.

          Possible values:

          o Raw

          o Redacted

       --segment-types (list)
          Enum with segment types . Each value corresponds to a  segment  type
          returned  in the segments list of the API. Each segment type has its
          own structure. Different channels may have different  sets  of  sup-
          ported segment types.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Transcript
            Categories
            Issues
            Event
            Attachments
            PostContactSummary

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
