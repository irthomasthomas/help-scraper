GET-SUBJECT()                                                    GET-SUBJECT()



NAME
       get-subject -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  Subject.  A Subject associates a certificate identity with au-
       thentication attempts by CreateSession. The  Subject  resources  stores
       audit  information  such  as status of the last authentication attempt,
       the certificate data used in the attempt, and the last time the associ-
       ated identity attempted authentication.
          Required permissions:  rolesanywhere:GetSubject .

SYNOPSIS
            get-subject
          --subject-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subject-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the subject.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
