CREATE-TRUST-ANCHOR()                                    CREATE-TRUST-ANCHOR()



NAME
       create-trust-anchor -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a trust anchor. You establish trust between IAM Roles Anywhere
       and your certificate authority (CA) by configuring a  trust  anchor.  A
       Trust Anchor is defined either as a reference to a AWS Certificate Man-
       ager Private Certificate Authority (ACM PCA), or by  uploading  a  Cer-
       tificate  Authority  (CA) certificate. Your AWS workloads can authenti-
       cate with the trust anchor using certificates  issued  by  the  trusted
       Certificate Authority (CA) in exchange for temporary AWS credentials.
          Required permissions:  rolesanywhere:CreateTrustAnchor .

          sourceData -> (tagged union structure)
              The data field of the trust anchor depending on its type.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following
                 top level keys can be set: acmPcaArn, x509CertificateData.

              acmPcaArn -> (string)
                 The root certificate of the Certificate Manager Private  Cer-
                 tificate  Authority  specified  by  this ARN is used in trust
                 validation for CreateSession operations. Included  for  trust
                 anchors of type AWS_ACM_PCA .

              x509CertificateData -> (string)
                 The PEM-encoded data for the certificate anchor. Included for
                 trust anchors of type CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE .

          sourceType -> (string)
              The type of the trust anchor.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          sourceData={acmPcaArn=string,x509CertificateData=string},sourceType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "sourceData": {
              "acmPcaArn": "string",
              "x509CertificateData": "string"
            },
            "sourceType": "AWS_ACM_PCA"|"CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE"|"SELF_SIGNED_REPOSITORY"
          }

       --tags (list)
          The tags to attach to the trust anchor.

          (structure)
              A label that consists of a key and value you define.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
