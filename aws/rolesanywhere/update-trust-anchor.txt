NAME
       update-trust-anchor -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the trust anchor.You establish trust between IAM Roles Anywhere
       and your certificate authority (CA) by configuring a  trust  anchor.  A
       Trust Anchor is defined either as a reference to a AWS Certificate Man-
       ager Private Certificate Authority (ACM PCA), or by  uploading  a  Cer-
       tificate  Authority  (CA) certificate. Your AWS workloads can authenti-
       cate with the trust anchor using certificates  issued  by  the  trusted
       Certificate Authority (CA) in exchange for temporary AWS credentials.
          Required permissions:  rolesanywhere:UpdateTrustAnchor .

SYNOPSIS
            update-trust-anchor
          [--name <value>]
          [--source <value>]
          --trust-anchor-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the trust anchor.

       --source (structure)
          The trust anchor type and its related certificate data.

          sourceData -> (structure)
              The data field of the trust anchor depending on its type.

              acmPcaArn -> (string)
                 The  root certificate of the Certificate Manager Private Cer-
                 tificate Authority specified by this ARN  is  used  in  trust
                 validation  for  CreateSession operations. Included for trust
                 anchors of type AWS_ACM_PCA .

              x509CertificateData -> (string)
                 The PEM-encoded data for the certificate anchor. Included for
                 trust anchors of type CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE .

          sourceType -> (string)
              The type of the trust anchor.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          sourceData={acmPcaArn=string,x509CertificateData=string},sourceType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "sourceData": {
              "acmPcaArn": "string",
              "x509CertificateData": "string"
            },
            "sourceType": "AWS_ACM_PCA"|"CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE"|"SELF_SIGNED_REPOSITORY"
          }

       --trust-anchor-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the trust anchor.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
