NAME
       list-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all profiles in the authenticated account and Amazon Web Services
       Region.
          Required permissions:  rolesanywhere:ListProfiles .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-profiles is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: profiles

SYNOPSIS
            list-profiles
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          The number of resources in the paginated list.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where the output should continue from,  if  a

          sults, call the operation again with this value.

              enabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the profile is enabled.

              managedPolicyArns -> (list)

              profileId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the profile.

              requireInstanceProperties -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  instance  properties  are   required   in

              roleArns -> (list)
                 A  list  of  IAM  roles  that  this  profile  can assume in a

              updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The ISO-8601 timestamp when the profile was last updated.
