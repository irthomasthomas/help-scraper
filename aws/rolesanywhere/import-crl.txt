SYNOPSIS
            import-crl
          --crl-data <value>
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          --name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          --trust-anchor-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --crl-data (blob)
          The x509 v3 specified certificate revocation list

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether the certificate revocation list (CRL) is enabled.

       --name (string)
          The name of the certificate revocation list (CRL).

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to attach to the certificate revocation list (CRL).

          (structure)
              A label that consists of a key and value you define.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --trust-anchor-arn (string)
          The ARN of the TrustAnchor the  certificate  revocation  list  (CRL)
          will provide revocation for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
