NAME
       list-crls -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all Crls in the authenticated account and Amazon Web Services Re-
       gion.
          Required permissions:  rolesanywhere:ListCrls .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-crls is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation by providing the --no-paginate argument.   When  using  --output
       text  and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query ar-
       gument must extract data from the results of the  following  query  ex-
       pressions: crls

SYNOPSIS
            list-crls
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          The number of resources in the paginated list.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       crls -> (list)
          A list of certificate revocation lists (CRL).

          (structure)
              The state of the certificate revocation list (CRL) after a  read
              or write operation.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  ISO-8601  timestamp when the certificate revocation list
                 (CRL) was created.

              crlArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the certificate revocation list (CRL).

              crlData -> (blob)
                 The state of the certificate revocation list  (CRL)  after  a
                 read or write operation.

              crlId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  of  the  certificate revocation list
                 (CRL).

              enabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the certificate revocation  list  (CRL)  is
                 enabled.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the certificate revocation list (CRL).

              trustAnchorArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the TrustAnchor the certificate revocation list
                 (CRL) will provide revocation for.

              updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The ISO-8601 timestamp when the certificate  revocation  list
                 (CRL) was last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that indicates where the output should continue from, if a
          previous operation did not show all results. To  get  the  next  re-
          sults, call the operation again with this value.
