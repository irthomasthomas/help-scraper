NAME
       update-crl -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  certificate  revocation list (CRL). CRl is a list of cer-
       tificates that have been revoked by the issuing  certificate  Authority

       credentials.
          Required permissions:  rolesanywhere:UpdateCrl .

SYNOPSIS
            update-crl
          [--crl-data <value>]
          --crl-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --crl-data (blob)
          The x509 v3 specified certificate revocation list

       --crl-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the certificate revocation list (CRL).

       --name (string)
          The name of the Crl.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
