PUT-GROUP()                                                        PUT-GROUP()



NAME
       put-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Create,  or  updates, a mapping of userswho have access to a documentto
       groups.

       You can also map sub groups to groups. For example, the group  "Company
       Intellectual  Property Teams" includes sub groups "Research" and "Engi-
       neering". These sub groups include their own list of  users  or  people
       who  work in these teams. Only users who work in research and engineer-
       ing, and therefore belong in the intellectual property group,  can  see
       top-secret company documents in their Amazon Q Business chat results.

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the application in which the user and group map-
          ping belongs.

       --data-source-id (string)
          The identifier of the data source for which you want to map users to
          their  groups.  This  is  useful if a group is tied to multiple data
          sources, but you only want the group to access documents of  a  cer-
          tain data source. For example, the groups "Research", "Engineering",
          and "Sales and Marketing" are all tied to  the  company's  documents
          stored  in  the  data  sources  Confluence  and Salesforce. However,
          "Sales and Marketing" team only  needs  access  to  customer-related
          documents stored in Salesforce.

       --group-members (structure)
          A  list  of  users or sub groups that belong to a group. This is for
          generating Amazon Q Business chat results only from document a  user
          has access to.

          memberGroups -> (list)
              A  list  of  sub groups that belong to a group. For example, the
              sub groups "Research", "Engineering", and "Sales and  Marketing"
              all belong to the group "Company".

              (structure)
                 The sub groups that belong to a group.

                 groupName -> (string)
                     The name of the sub group.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the sub group.

          memberUsers -> (list)
              A  list  of users that belong to a group. For example, a list of
              interns all belong to the "Interns" group.

              (structure)
                 The users that belong to a group.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the user.

                 userId -> (string)
                     The identifier of the user you want to map to a group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          memberGroups=[{groupName=string,type=string},{groupName=string,type=string}],memberUsers=[{type=string,userId=string},{type=string,userId=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "memberGroups": [
              {
                "groupName": "string",
                "type": "INDEX"|"DATASOURCE"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "memberUsers": [
              {
                "type": "INDEX"|"DATASOURCE",
                "userId": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --group-name (string)
          The list that contains your users or sub groups that belong the same
          group.  For example, the group "Company" includes the user "CEO" and
          the sub groups "Research", "Engineering", and "Sales and Marketing".

          If you have more than 1000 users and/or  sub  groups  for  a  single
          group,  you  need to provide the path to the S3 file that lists your
          users and sub groups for a group. Your sub groups can  contain  more
          than  1000  users, but the list of sub groups that belong to a group
          (and/or users) must be no more than 1000.

       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index in which you want to map users to  their
          groups.

       --type (string)
          The type of the group.

          Possible values:

          o INDEX

          o DATASOURCE

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)
