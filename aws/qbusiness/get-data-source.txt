GET-DATA-SOURCE()                                            GET-DATA-SOURCE()



NAME
       get-data-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about an existing Amazon Q Business data source con-
       nector.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-data-source uses document type values. Document  types  follow  the
       JSON  data  model  where  valid values are: strings, numbers, booleans,
       null, arrays, and objects. For command input, options and nested param-
       eters that are labeled with the type document must be provided as JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Q Business application.

       --index-id (string)
          The identfier of the index used with the data source connector.

       --data-source-id (string)
          The identifier of the data source connector.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

              (structure)
                 Provides the configuration  information  for  applying  basic
                 logic  to  alter document metadata and content when ingesting
                 documents into Amazon Q Business.

                 To apply advanced logic, to go beyond what you  can  do  with
                 basic        logic,       see       `       HookConfiguration
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_HookConfiguration.html`__
                 .

                 For more information, see Custom document enrichment .

                 condition -> (structure)
                     The  condition  used for the target document attribute or
                     metadata field when ingesting  documents  into  Amazon  Q
                     Business.  You  use  this  with ` DocumentAttributeTarget
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html`__
                     to apply the condition.

                     For example, you can create the 'Department' target field
                     and have it prefill department names associated with  the
                     documents based on information in the 'Source_URI' field.
                     Set the condition that if the 'Source_URI' field contains
                     'financial'  in  its  URI  value, then prefill the target
                     field 'Department' with the target  value  'Finance'  for
                     the document.

                     Amazon  Q  Business can't create a target field if it has
                     not already been created as an  index  field.  After  you
                     create  your index field, you can create a document meta-
                     data field using DocumentAttributeTarget . Amazon Q Busi-
                     ness  then  will map your newly created metadata field to
                     your index field.

                     key -> (string)
                        The identifier of the document attribute used for  the
                        condition.

                        For  example,  'Source_URI' could be an identifier for
                        the attribute or metadata field that  contains  source
                        URIs associated with the documents.

                        Amazon  Q  Business  currently  doesn't support _docu-
                        ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                     operator -> (string)
                        The identifier of the document attribute used for  the
                        condition.

                        For  example,  'Source_URI' could be an identifier for
                        the attribute or metadata field that  contains  source
                        URIs associated with the documents.

                        Amazon  Q  Business  currently does not support _docu-
                        ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                     value -> (tagged union structure)
                        The value of a document attribute. You can  only  pro-
                        vide one value for a document attribute.

                        NOTE:
                            This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the
                            following top level keys can be set:  stringValue,
                            stringListValue, longValue, dateValue.

                        stringValue -> (string)
                            A string.

                        stringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings.

                            (string)

                        longValue -> (long)
                            A long integer value.

                        dateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It's important for the time zone to be included in
                            the  ISO  8601  date-time  format.  For   example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00    is   the   ISO   8601
                            date-time format for March 25th  2012  at  12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

                 target -> (structure)
                     The  target document attribute or metadata field you want
                     to alter when ingesting documents into Amazon Q Business.

                     For example, you can delete all  customer  identification
                     numbers associated with the documents, stored in the doc-
                     ument metadata field called 'Customer_ID' by setting  the
                     target key as 'Customer_ID' and the deletion flag to TRUE
                     . This removes all customer ID values in the field  'Cus-
                     tomer_ID'.  This  would scrub personally identifiable in-
                     formation from each document's metadata.

                     Amazon Q Business can't create a target field if  it  has
                     not  already  been  created  as an index field. After you
                     create your index field, you can create a document  meta-
                     data     field     using     `    DocumentAttributeTarget
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html`__
                     . Amazon Q Business will then map your newly created doc-
                     ument attribute to your index field.

                     You can also use this with  `  DocumentAttributeCondition
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeCondition.html`__
                     .

                     key -> (string)
                        The identifier of the  target  document  attribute  or
                        metadata  field. For example, 'Department' could be an
                        identifier for the target attribute or metadata  field
                        that includes the department names associated with the
                        documents.

                     value -> (tagged union structure)
                        The value of a document attribute. You can  only  pro-
                        vide one value for a document attribute.

                        NOTE:
                            This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the
                            following top level keys can be set:  stringValue,
                            stringListValue, longValue, dateValue.

                        stringValue -> (string)
                            A string.

                        stringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings.

                            (string)

                        longValue -> (long)
                            A long integer value.

                        dateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It's important for the time zone to be included in
                            the  ISO  8601  date-time  format.  For   example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00    is   the   ISO   8601
                            date-time format for March 25th  2012  at  12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

                     attributeValueOperator -> (string)
                        TRUE  to  delete  the  existing  target value for your
                        specified target attribute key. You  cannot  create  a
                        target value and set this to TRUE .

                 documentContentOperator -> (string)
                     TRUE to delete content if the condition used for the tar-
                     get attribute is met.

          preExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
              Provides the configuration information  for  invoking  a  Lambda
              function  in  Lambda to alter document metadata and content when
              ingesting documents into Amazon Q Business.

              You can configure your Lambda function using the  PreExtraction-
              HookConfiguration parameter if you want to apply advanced alter-
              ations on the original or raw documents.

              If you want to apply advanced alterations on the Amazon Q  Busi-
              ness  structured documents, you must configure your Lambda func-
              tion using PostExtractionHookConfiguration .

              You can only invoke one Lambda function. However, this  function
              can invoke other functions it requires.

              For more information, see Custom document enrichment .

              invocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The  condition  used for when a Lambda function should be in-
                 voked.

                 For example, you can specify a condition that  if  there  are
                 empty  date-time values, then Amazon Q Business should invoke
                 a function that inserts the current date-time.

                 key -> (string)
                     The identifier of the document  attribute  used  for  the
                     condition.

                     For  example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon   Q  Business  currently  doesn't  support  _docu-
                     ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 operator -> (string)
                     The identifier of the document  attribute  used  for  the
                     condition.

                     For  example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon  Q  Business  currently  does  not  support _docu-
                     ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 value -> (tagged union structure)
                     The value of a document attribute. You can  only  provide
                     one value for a document attribute.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing  top  level  keys  can  be  set:   stringValue,
                        stringListValue, longValue, dateValue.

                     stringValue -> (string)
                        A string.

                     stringListValue -> (list)
                        A list of strings.

                        (string)

                     longValue -> (long)
                        A long integer value.

                     dateValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                        It's important for the time zone to be included in the
                        ISO    8601    date-time    format.    For    example,
                        2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00  is  the  ISO 8601 date-time
                        format for March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM  (plus  10  sec-
                        onds) in Central European Time.

              lambdaArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to
                 run a Lambda function during ingestion. For more information,
                 see IAM roles for Custom Document Enrichment (CDE) .

              s3BucketName -> (string)
                 Stores  the original, raw documents or the structured, parsed
                 documents before and after altering them. For  more  informa-
                 tion, see Data contracts for Lambda functions .

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to
                 run PreExtractionHookConfiguration and PostExtractionHookCon-
                 figuration  for altering document metadata and content during
                 the document ingestion process.

          postExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
              Provides the configuration information  for  invoking  a  Lambda
              function  in  Lambda to alter document metadata and content when
              ingesting documents into Amazon Q Business.

              You can configure your Lambda function using the  PreExtraction-
              HookConfiguration parameter if you want to apply advanced alter-
              ations on the original or raw documents.

              If you want to apply advanced alterations on the Amazon Q  Busi-
              ness  structured documents, you must configure your Lambda func-
              tion using PostExtractionHookConfiguration .

              You can only invoke one Lambda function. However, this  function
              can invoke other functions it requires.

              For more information, see Custom document enrichment .

              invocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The  condition  used for when a Lambda function should be in-
                 voked.

                 For example, you can specify a condition that  if  there  are
                 empty  date-time values, then Amazon Q Business should invoke
                 a function that inserts the current date-time.

                 key -> (string)
                     The identifier of the document  attribute  used  for  the
                     condition.

                     For  example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon   Q  Business  currently  doesn't  support  _docu-
                     ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 operator -> (string)
                     The identifier of the document  attribute  used  for  the
                     condition.

                     For  example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon  Q  Business  currently  does  not  support _docu-
                     ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 value -> (tagged union structure)
                     The value of a document attribute. You can  only  provide
                     one value for a document attribute.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing  top  level  keys  can  be  set:   stringValue,
