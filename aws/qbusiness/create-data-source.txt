CREATE-DATA-SOURCE()                                      CREATE-DATA-SOURCE()



NAME
       create-data-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a data source connector for an Amazon Q Business application.
          CreateDataSource  is  a synchronous operation. The operation returns
          200 if the data source was successfully created. Otherwise,  an  ex-
          ception is raised.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       create-data-source uses document type values. Document types follow the
       JSON data model where valid values  are:  strings,  numbers,  booleans,
       null, arrays, and objects. For command input, options and nested param-
       eters that are labeled with the type document must be provided as JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Q Business application the data source
          will be attached to.

       --client-token (string)
          A token you provide to identify a request to create  a  data  source
          connector.  Multiple calls to the CreateDataSource API with the same
          client token will create only one data source connector.

       --configuration (document)
          Configuration information to connect to your data source repository.
          For  configuration  templates  for  your  specific  data source, see
          Supported connectors .

       JSON Syntax:

          {...}

       --description (string)
          A description for the data source connector.

       --display-name (string)
          A name for the data source connector.

       --document-enrichment-configuration (structure)
          Provides the configuration information for altering  document  meta-
          data and content during the document ingestion process.

          For more information, see Custom document enrichment .

          inlineConfigurations -> (list)
              Configuration  information to alter document attributes or meta-
              data fields and content when ingesting documents into  Amazon  Q
              Business.

              (structure)
                 Provides  the  configuration  information  for applying basic
                 logic to alter document metadata and content  when  ingesting
                 documents into Amazon Q Business.

                 To  apply  advanced  logic, to go beyond what you can do with
                 basic       logic,       see       `        HookConfiguration
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_HookConfiguration.html`__
                 .

                 For more information, see Custom document enrichment .

                 condition -> (structure)
                     The condition used for the target document  attribute  or
                     metadata  field  when  ingesting  documents into Amazon Q
                     Business. You use  this  with  `  DocumentAttributeTarget
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html`__
                     to apply the condition.

                     For example, you can create the 'Department' target field
                     and  have it prefill department names associated with the
                     documents based on information in the 'Source_URI' field.
                     Set the condition that if the 'Source_URI' field contains
                     'financial' in its URI value,  then  prefill  the  target
                     field  'Department'  with  the target value 'Finance' for
                     the document.

                     Amazon Q Business can't create a target field if  it  has
                     not  already  been  created  as an index field. After you
                     create your index field, you can create a document  meta-
                     data field using DocumentAttributeTarget . Amazon Q Busi-
                     ness then will map your newly created metadata  field  to
                     your index field.

                     key -> (string)
                        The  identifier of the document attribute used for the
                        condition.

                        For example, 'Source_URI' could be an  identifier  for
                        the  attribute  or metadata field that contains source
                        URIs associated with the documents.

                        Amazon Q Business  currently  doesn't  support  _docu-
                        ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                     operator -> (string)
                        The  identifier of the document attribute used for the
                        condition.

                        For example, 'Source_URI' could be an  identifier  for
                        the  attribute  or metadata field that contains source
                        URIs associated with the documents.

                        Amazon  Kendra  currently  does  not  support   _docu-
                        ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                     value -> (tagged union structure)
                        The  value  of a document attribute. You can only pro-
                        vide one value for a document attribute.

                        NOTE:
                            This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the
                            following  top  level  keys can be set: dateValue,
                            longValue, stringListValue, stringValue.

                        dateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It's important for the time zone to be included in
                            the   ISO  8601  date-time  format.  For  example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00   is   the   ISO    8601
                            date-time  format  for  March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

                        longValue -> (long)
                            A long integer value.

                        stringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings.

                            (string)

                        stringValue -> (string)
                            A string.

                 documentContentOperator -> (string)
                     TRUE to delete content if the condition used for the tar-
                     get attribute is met.

                 target -> (structure)
                     The  target document attribute or metadata field you want
                     to alter when ingesting documents into Amazon Q Business.

                     For example, you can delete all  customer  identification
                     numbers associated with the documents, stored in the doc-
                     ument metadata field called 'Customer_ID' by setting  the
                     target key as 'Customer_ID' and the deletion flag to TRUE
                     . This removes all customer ID values in the field  'Cus-
                     tomer_ID'.  This  would scrub personally identifiable in-
                     formation from each document's metadata.

                     Amazon Q Business can't create a target field if  it  has
                     not  already  been  created  as an index field. After you
                     create your index field, you can create a document  meta-
                     data     field     using     `    DocumentAttributeTarget
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html`__
                     . Amazon Q Business will then map your newly created doc-
                     ument attribute to your index field.

                     You can also use this with  `  DocumentAttributeCondition
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeCondition.html`__
                     .

                     attributeValueOperator -> (string)
                        TRUE to delete the  existing  target  value  for  your
                        specified  target  attribute  key. You cannot create a
                        target value and set this to TRUE .

                     key -> (string)
                        The identifier of the  target  document  attribute  or
                        metadata  field. For example, 'Department' could be an
                        identifier for the target attribute or metadata  field
                        that includes the department names associated with the
                        documents.

                     value -> (tagged union structure)
                        The value of a document attribute. You can  only  pro-
                        vide one value for a document attribute.

                        NOTE:
                            This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the
                            following top level keys can  be  set:  dateValue,
                            longValue, stringListValue, stringValue.

                        dateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It's important for the time zone to be included in
                            the  ISO  8601  date-time  format.  For   example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00    is   the   ISO   8601
                            date-time format for March 25th  2012  at  12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

                        longValue -> (long)
                            A long integer value.

                        stringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings.

                            (string)

                        stringValue -> (string)
                            A string.

          postExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
              Provides  the  configuration  information  for invoking a Lambda
              function in Lambda to alter document metadata and  content  when
              ingesting documents into Amazon Q Business.

              You     can     configure    your    Lambda    function    using
              PreExtractionHookConfiguration if you want to apply advanced al-
              terations on the original or raw documents.

              If  you want to apply advanced alterations on the Amazon Q Busi-
              ness structured documents, you must configure your Lambda  func-
              tion using PostExtractionHookConfiguration .

              You  can only invoke one Lambda function. However, this function
              can invoke other functions it requires.

              For more information, see Custom document enrichment .

              invocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The condition used for when a Lambda function should  be  in-
                 voked.

                 For  example,  you  can specify a condition that if there are
                 empty date-time values, then Amazon Q Business should  invoke
                 a function that inserts the current date-time.

                 key -> (string)
                     The  identifier  of  the  document attribute used for the
                     condition.

                     For example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for  the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon  Q  Business  currently  doesn't  support   _docu-
                     ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 operator -> (string)
                     The  identifier  of  the  document attribute used for the
                     condition.

                     For example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for  the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon Kendra currently does not  support  _document_body
                     as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 value -> (tagged union structure)
                     The  value  of a document attribute. You can only provide
                     one value for a document attribute.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing  top  level  keys  can be set: dateValue, long-
                        Value, stringListValue, stringValue.

                     dateValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                        It's important for the time zone to be included in the
                        ISO    8601    date-time    format.    For    example,
                        2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00 is the  ISO  8601  date-time
                        format  for  March  25th 2012 at 12:30PM (plus 10 sec-
                        onds) in Central European Time.

                     longValue -> (long)

                        A string.

              lambdaArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with  permission  to
                 run a Lambda function during ingestion. For more information,
                 see IAM roles for Custom Document Enrichment (CDE) .

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with  permission  to
                 run PreExtractionHookConfiguration and PostExtractionHookCon-
                 figuration for altering document metadata and content  during
                 the document ingestion process.

              s3BucketName -> (string)
                 Stores  the original, raw documents or the structured, parsed
                 documents before and after altering them. For  more  informa-
                 tion, see Data contracts for Lambda functions .

          preExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
              Provides  the  configuration  information  for invoking a Lambda
              function in Lambda to alter document metadata and  content  when
              ingesting documents into Amazon Q Business.

              You     can     configure    your    Lambda    function    using

                     For example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for  the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon  Q  Business  currently  doesn't  support   _docu-
                     ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 operator -> (string)
                     The  identifier  of  the  document attribute used for the
                     condition.

                     For example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for  the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon Kendra currently does not  support  _document_body
                     as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 value -> (tagged union structure)
                     The  value  of a document attribute. You can only provide
                     one value for a document attribute.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing  top  level  keys  can be set: dateValue, long-
                        Value, stringListValue, stringValue.

                     dateValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                        It's important for the time zone to be included in the
                        ISO    8601    date-time    format.    For    example,
                        2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00 is the  ISO  8601  date-time
                        format  for  March  25th 2012 at 12:30PM (plus 10 sec-
                        onds) in Central European Time.

                     longValue -> (long)
                        A long integer value.

                     stringListValue -> (list)
                        A list of strings.

                        (string)

                     stringValue -> (string)
                        A string.

              lambdaArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with  permission  to
                 run a Lambda function during ingestion. For more information,
                 see IAM roles for Custom Document Enrichment (CDE) .

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with  permission  to
                 run PreExtractionHookConfiguration and PostExtractionHookCon-
                 figuration for altering document metadata and content  during
                 the document ingestion process.

              s3BucketName -> (string)
                 Stores  the original, raw documents or the structured, parsed
                 documents before and after altering them. For  more  informa-
                 tion, see Data contracts for Lambda functions .
