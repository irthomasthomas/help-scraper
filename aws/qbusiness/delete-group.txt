DELETE-GROUP()                                                  DELETE-GROUP()



NAME
       delete-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  group  so  that all users and sub groups that belong to the
       group can no longer access documents only available to that group.  For
       example, after deleting the group "Summer Interns", all interns who be-
       longed to that group no longer see intern-only documents in their  chat
       results.

       If  you  want  to  delete,  update, or replace users or sub groups of a
       group, you need to use the PutGroup operation. For example, if  a  user
       in the group "Engineering" leaves the engineering team and another user
       takes their place, you provide an updated list of users or  sub  groups
       that belong to the "Engineering" group when calling PutGroup .

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  application in which the group mapping be-
          longs.

       --data-source-id (string)
          The identifier of the data source linked to the group

          A group can be tied to multiple data sources. You can delete a group
          from  accessing documents in a certain data source. For example, the
          groups "Research", "Engineering", and "Sales and Marketing" are  all
          tied  to  the company's documents stored in the data sources Conflu-
          ence and Salesforce. You want to delete "Research" and "Engineering"
          groups  from  Salesforce,  so  that  these groups cannot access cus-
          tomer-related documents stored in Salesforce. Only "Sales  and  Mar-
          keting" should access documents in the Salesforce data source.

       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group you want to delete.

       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want to delete the group from.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       --no-paginate (boolean)
