CREATE-DATA-ACCESSOR()                                  CREATE-DATA-ACCESSOR()



NAME
       create-data-accessor -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new data accessor for an ISV to access data from a Q Business
       application. The data accessor is an entity that represents  the  ISV's
       access  to  the Q Business application's data. It includes the IAM role
       ARN for the ISV, a friendly name, and a set  of  action  configurations
       that  define the specific actions the ISV is allowed to perform and any
       associated data filters. When the data accessor is created, an AWS  IAM
       Identity  Center  application is also created to manage the ISV's iden-
       tity and authentication for accessing the Q Business application.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive  identifier you provide to ensure idempo-
          tency of the request.

       --display-name (string)
          A friendly name for the data accessor.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to associate with the data accessor.

          (structure)
              A list of key/value pairs that identify an index, FAQ,  or  data
              source. Tag keys and values can consist of Unicode letters, dig-
              its, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / =  +
              - @.

              key -> (string)
                 The  key for the tag. Keys are not case sensitive and must be
                 unique for the Amazon Q Business application or data source.

              value -> (string)
                 The value associated with the tag. The value may be an  empty
                 string but it can't be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
