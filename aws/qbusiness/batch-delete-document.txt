       --index-id (string)

          uments to delete.

       --documents (list)

              tor.

              documentId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the deleted document.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          documentId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "documentId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --data-source-sync-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the data source sync during which the documents
          were deleted.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
