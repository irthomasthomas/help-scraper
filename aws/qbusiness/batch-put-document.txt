                        NOTE:
                            This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the
                            following  top level keys can be set: stringValue,
                            stringListValue, longValue, dateValue.

                        stringValue -> (string)
                            A string.

                        stringListValue -> (list)

                     blob parameter must be base64 encoded.  Your  code  might
                     not  need to encode the document file bytes if you're us-
                     ing an Amazon Web Services SDK to call Amazon Q  Business
                     APIs.  If  you are calling the Amazon Q Business endpoint
                     directly using REST, you must base64 encode the  contents

                 The file type of the document in the Blob field.

                 If  you  want  to index snippets or subsets of HTML documents
                 instead of the entirety of the HTML documents,  you  add  the
                 HTML  start  and  closing tags (<HTML>content</HTML> ) around
                 the content.

                        .

                        For more information, see Custom document enrichment .

                        condition -> (structure)
                            The condition used for the target document  attri-
                            bute  or  metadata  field when ingesting documents
                            into Amazon Q Business. You use this with `  Docu-
                            mentAttributeTarget
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html`__
                            to apply the condition.

                            For  example, you can create the 'Department' tar-
                            get field and have it prefill department names as-
                            sociated  with  the documents based on information
                            in the 'Source_URI' field. Set the condition  that
                            if  the 'Source_URI' field contains 'financial' in
                            its URI value, then prefill the target field  'De-
                            partment'  with the target value 'Finance' for the
                            document.

                            Amazon Q Business can't create a target  field  if
                            it has not already been created as an index field.
                            After you create your index field, you can  create
                            a document metadata field using DocumentAttribute-
                            Target . Amazon Q  Business  then  will  map  your
                            newly created metadata field to your index field.

                            key -> (string)
                               The  identifier  of the document attribute used
                               for the condition.

                               For example, 'Source_URI' could be  an  identi-
                               fier  for  the attribute or metadata field that
                               contains source URIs associated with the  docu-
                               ments.

                               Amazon  Q  Business  currently  doesn't support
                               _document_body as an attribute key used for the
                               condition.

                            operator -> (string)
                               The  identifier  of the document attribute used
                               for the condition.

                               For example, 'Source_URI' could be  an  identi-
                               fier  for  the attribute or metadata field that
                               contains source URIs associated with the  docu-
                               ments.

                               Amazon  Q  Business  currently does not support
                               _document_body as an attribute key used for the
                               condition.

                            value -> (tagged union structure)
                               The value of a document attribute. You can only
                               provide one value for a document attribute.

                               NOTE:
                                   This is a Tagged Union structure. Only  one
                                   of the following top level keys can be set:
                                   stringValue,  stringListValue,   longValue,
                                   dateValue.

                               stringValue -> (string)
                                   A string.

                               stringListValue -> (list)
                                   A list of strings.

                                   (string)

                               longValue -> (long)
                                   A long integer value.

                               dateValue -> (timestamp)
                                   A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                                   It's  important for the time zone to be in-
                                   cluded in the ISO  8601  date-time  format.
                                   For  example,  2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00 is
                                   the ISO 8601  date-time  format  for  March
                                   25th  2012  at 12:30PM (plus 10 seconds) in
                                   Central European Time.

                        target -> (structure)
                            The target document attribute  or  metadata  field
                            you  want  to  alter when ingesting documents into
                            Amazon Q Business.

                            For example, you can delete all customer identifi-
                            cation  numbers  associated  with  the  documents,
                            stored in the document metadata field called 'Cus-
                            tomer_ID'  by  setting  the  target  key  as 'Cus-
                            tomer_ID' and the deletion flag to TRUE . This re-
                            moves  all  customer  ID values in the field 'Cus-
                            tomer_ID'. This would scrub  personally  identifi-
                            able information from each document's metadata.

                            Amazon  Q  Business can't create a target field if
                            it has not already been created as an index field.
                            After  you create your index field, you can create
                            a document  metadata  field  using  `  DocumentAt-

                            key -> (string)
                               The identifier of the target document attribute
                               or metadata field.  For  example,  'Department'
                               could be an identifier for the target attribute
                               or metadata field that includes the  department
                               names associated with the documents.

                            value -> (tagged union structure)
                               The value of a document attribute. You can only
                               provide one value for a document attribute.

                               NOTE:
                                   This is a Tagged Union structure. Only  one
                                   of the following top level keys can be set:
                                   stringValue,  stringListValue,   longValue,
                                   dateValue.

                               stringValue -> (string)
                                   A string.

                               stringListValue -> (list)
                                   A list of strings.

                                   (string)

                               longValue -> (long)
                                   A long integer value.

                               dateValue -> (timestamp)
                                   A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                                   It's  important for the time zone to be in-
                                   cluded in the ISO  8601  date-time  format.
                                   For  example,  2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00 is
                                   the ISO 8601  date-time  format  for  March
                                   25th  2012  at 12:30PM (plus 10 seconds) in
                                   Central European Time.

                            attributeValueOperator -> (string)
                               TRUE to delete the existing  target  value  for
                               your specified target attribute key. You cannot
                               create a target value and set this to TRUE .

                        documentContentOperator -> (string)
                            TRUE to delete content if the condition  used  for
                            the target attribute is met.

                 preExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Provides  the  configuration  information  for invoking a
                     Lambda function in Lambda to alter document metadata  and
                     content when ingesting documents into Amazon Q Business.

                     You  can  configure your Lambda function using the PreEx-
                     tractionHookConfiguration parameter if you want to  apply
                     advanced alterations on the original or raw documents.

                     If you want to apply advanced alterations on the Amazon Q
                     Business structured documents, you  must  configure  your
                     Lambda function using PostExtractionHookConfiguration .

                     You  can  only  invoke one Lambda function. However, this
                     function can invoke other functions it requires.

                     For more information, see Custom document enrichment .

                     invocationCondition -> (structure)
                        The condition used for when a Lambda  function  should
                        be invoked.

                        For example, you can specify a condition that if there
                        are empty date-time values,  then  Amazon  Q  Business
                        should  invoke  a  function  that  inserts the current
                        date-time.

                        key -> (string)
                            The identifier of the document attribute used  for
                            the condition.

                            For  example,  'Source_URI' could be an identifier
                            for the attribute or metadata field that  contains
                            source URIs associated with the documents.

                            Amazon Q Business currently doesn't support _docu-
                            ment_body as an attribute key used for the  condi-
                            tion.

                        operator -> (string)
                            The  identifier of the document attribute used for
                            the condition.

                            For example, 'Source_URI' could be  an  identifier
                            for  the attribute or metadata field that contains
                            source URIs associated with the documents.

                        value -> (tagged union structure)
                            The value of a document attribute.  You  can  only
                            provide one value for a document attribute.

                            NOTE:
                               This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of
                               the  following  top  level  keys  can  be  set:
                               stringValue,  stringListValue, longValue, date-
                               Value.

                            stringValue -> (string)
                               A string.

                            stringListValue -> (list)
                               A list of strings.

                               (string)

                            longValue -> (long)

                               It's important for the time zone to be included
                               in  the ISO 8601 date-time format. For example,
                               2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00  is  the   ISO   8601
                               date-time format for March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM
                               (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.
