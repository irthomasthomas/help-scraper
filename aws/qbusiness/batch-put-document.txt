NAME
       batch-put-document -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds one or more documents to an Amazon Q index.

       You use this API to:

       o ingest  your  structured  and  unstructured  documents  and documents
         stored in an Amazon S3 bucket into an Amazon Q index.

       o add custom attributes to documents in an Amazon Q index.

       o attach an access control list to the documents added to an  Amazon  Q
         index.

       You  can  see  the progress of the deletion, and any error messages re-
       lated to the process, by using CloudWatch.

                            following  top  level  keys can be set: dateValue,
                            longValue, stringListValue, stringValue.

                        dateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It's important for the time zone to be included in
                            the   ISO  8601  date-time  format.  For  example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00   is   the   ISO    8601
                            date-time  format  for  March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM

                        stringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings.

                            (string)

                        stringValue -> (string)
                            A string.

              content -> (tagged union structure)
                 The contents of the document.

                 NOTE:
                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
                     ing top level keys can be set: blob, s3.

                 blob -> (blob)
                     The  contents  of  the  document. Documents passed to the
                     blob parameter must be base64 encoded.  Your  code  might
                     not  need to encode the document file bytes if you're us-
                     ing an Amazon Web Services SDK to call Amazon Q APIs.  If
                     you  are  calling  the  Amazon  Q endpoint directly using
                     REST, you must base64 encode the contents before sending.

                 s3 -> (structure)
                     The path to the document in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     bucket -> (string)
                        The name of the S3 bucket that contains the file.

                     key -> (string)
                        The name of the file.

              contentType -> (string)
                 The file type of the document in the Blob field.

                 If you want to index snippets or subsets  of  HTML  documents
                 instead  of  the  entirety of the HTML documents, you add the
                 HTML start and closing tags  (<HTML>content</HTML>  )  around
                 the content.

              documentEnrichmentConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  configuration information for altering document metadata
                 and content during the document ingestion process.

                 inlineConfigurations -> (list)
                     Configuration information to alter document attributes or
                     metadata fields and content when ingesting documents into
                     Amazon Q.

                     (structure)
                        Provides the configuration  information  for  applying
                        basic  logic  to  alter  document metadata and content
                        when ingesting documents into Amazon Q.

                        To apply advanced logic, to go beyond what you can  do
                        with    basic    logic,    see   `   HookConfiguration
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enterpriseq/latest/APIReference/API_HookConfiguration.html`__
                        .

                        For more information, see Custom document enrichment .

                        condition -> (structure)
                            The  condition used for the target document attri-
                            bute or metadata field  when  ingesting  documents
                            into  Amazon  Q.  You  use this with ` DocumentAt-
                            tributeTarget
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enterpriseq/latest/APIReference/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html`__
                            to apply the condition.

                            For example, you can create the 'Department'  tar-
                            get field and have it prefill department names as-
                            sociated with the documents based  on  information
                            in  the 'Source_URI' field. Set the condition that
                            if the 'Source_URI' field contains 'financial'  in
                            its  URI value, then prefill the target field 'De-
                            partment' with the target value 'Finance' for  the
                            document.

                            Amazon Q can't create a target field if it has not
                            already been created as an index field. After  you
                            create your index field, you can create a document
                            metadata  field  using  DocumentAttributeTarget  .
                            Amazon Q then will map your newly created metadata
                            field to your index field.

                            key -> (string)
                               The identifier of the document  attribute  used
                               for the condition.

                               For  example,  'Source_URI' could be an identi-
                               fier for the attribute or metadata  field  that
                               contains  source URIs associated with the docu-
                               ments.

                               Amazon  Q  currently  doesn't  support   _docu-
                               ment_body as an attribute key used for the con-
                               dition.

                            operator -> (string)
                               The identifier of the document  attribute  used
                               for the condition.

                               For  example,  'Source_URI' could be an identi-
                               fier for the attribute or metadata  field  that
                               contains  source URIs associated with the docu-
                               ments.

                               Amazon Kendra currently does not support _docu-
                               ment_body as an attribute key used for the con-
                               dition.

                            value -> (tagged union structure)
                               The value of a document attribute. You can only
                               provide one value for a document attribute.

                               NOTE:
                                   This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one
                                   of the following top level keys can be set:
                                   dateValue,    longValue,   stringListValue,
                                   stringValue.

                               dateValue -> (timestamp)
                                   A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                                   It's important for the time zone to be  in-
                                   cluded  in  the  ISO 8601 date-time format.
                                   For example,  2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00  is
                                   the  ISO  8601  date-time  format for March
                                   25th 2012 at 12:30PM (plus 10  seconds)  in
                                   Central European Time.

                               longValue -> (long)
                                   A long integer value.

                               stringListValue -> (list)
                                   A list of strings.

                                   (string)

                               stringValue -> (string)
                                   A string.

                        documentContentOperator -> (string)
                            TRUE  to  delete content if the condition used for
                            the target attribute is met.

                        target -> (structure)
                            The target document attribute  or  metadata  field
                            you  want  to  alter when ingesting documents into
                            Amazon Q.

                            For example, you can delete all customer identifi-
                            cation  numbers  associated  with  the  documents,
                            stored in the document metadata field called 'Cus-
                            tomer_ID'  by  setting  the  target  key  as 'Cus-
                            tomer_ID' and the deletion flag to TRUE . This re-
                            moves  all  customer  ID values in the field 'Cus-
                            tomer_ID'. This would scrub  personally  identifi-
                            able information from each document's metadata.

                            Amazon Q can't create a target field if it has not
                            already been created as an index field. After  you
                            create your index field, you can create a document
                            metadata  field  using  `  DocumentAttributeTarget
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enterpriseq/latest/APIReference/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html`__
                            . Amazon Q will then map your newly created  docu-
                            ment attribute to your index field.

                            You can also use this with ` DocumentAttributeCon-
                            dition
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enterpriseq/latest/APIReference/API_DocumentAttributeCondition.html`__

                            attributeValueOperator -> (string)
                               TRUE to delete the existing  target  value  for
                               your specified target attribute key. You cannot
                               create a target value and set this to TRUE .

                            key -> (string)
                               The identifier of the target document attribute
                               or  metadata  field.  For example, 'Department'
                               could be an identifier for the target attribute
                               or  metadata field that includes the department
                               names associated with the documents.

                            value -> (tagged union structure)
                               The value of a document attribute. You can only
                               provide one value for a document attribute.

                               NOTE:
                                   This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one
                                   of the following top level keys can be set:
                                   dateValue,    longValue,   stringListValue,
                                   stringValue.

                               dateValue -> (timestamp)
                                   A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                                   It's important for the time zone to be  in-
                                   cluded  in  the  ISO 8601 date-time format.
                                   For example,  2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00  is
                                   the  ISO  8601  date-time  format for March
                                   25th 2012 at 12:30PM (plus 10  seconds)  in
                                   Central European Time.

                               longValue -> (long)
                                   A long integer value.

                               stringListValue -> (list)
                                   A list of strings.

                                   (string)

                               stringValue -> (string)
                                   A string.

                 postExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Provides  the  configuration  information  for invoking a
                     Lambda function in Lambda to alter document metadata  and
                     content when ingesting documents into Amazon Q.

                     You    can   configure   your   Lambda   function   using
                     PreExtractionHookConfiguration if you want to  apply  ad-
                     vanced alterations on the original or raw documents.

                     If you want to apply advanced alterations on the Amazon Q
                     structured documents,  you  must  configure  your  Lambda
                     function using PostExtractionHookConfiguration .

                     You  can  only  invoke one Lambda function. However, this
                     function can invoke other functions it requires.

                     For more information, see Custom document enrichment .

                     invocationCondition -> (structure)
                        The condition used for when a Lambda  function  should
                        be invoked.

                        For example, you can specify a condition that if there
                        are empty date-time values, then Amazon Q  should  in-
                        voke a function that inserts the current date-time.

                        key -> (string)
                            The  identifier of the document attribute used for
                            the condition.

                            For example, 'Source_URI' could be  an  identifier
                            for  the attribute or metadata field that contains
                            source URIs associated with the documents.

                            Amazon Q currently doesn't support  _document_body
                            as an attribute key used for the condition.

                        operator -> (string)
                            The  identifier of the document attribute used for
                            the condition.

                            For example, 'Source_URI' could be  an  identifier
                            for  the attribute or metadata field that contains
                            source URIs associated with the documents.

                            Amazon Kendra currently does  not  support  _docu-
                            ment_body  as an attribute key used for the condi-
                            tion.

                        value -> (tagged union structure)
                            The value of a document attribute.  You  can  only
                            provide one value for a document attribute.

                            NOTE:
                               This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of
                               the following top level keys can be set:  date-
                               Value, longValue, stringListValue, stringValue.

                            dateValue -> (timestamp)
                               A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                               It's important for the time zone to be included
                               in the ISO 8601 date-time format. For  example,
                               2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00   is   the  ISO  8601
