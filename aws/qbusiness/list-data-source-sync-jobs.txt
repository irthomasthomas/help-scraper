NAME
       list-data-source-sync-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Get  information  about an Amazon Q Business data source connector syn-
       chronization.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-data-source-sync-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: history

OPTIONS
       --data-source-id (string)
          The identifier of the data source connector.

       --application-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Q Business application connected to the
          data source.

       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index used with the  Amazon  Q  Business  data
          source connector.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time of the data source connector sync.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time of the data source connector sync.

       --status-filter (string)
          Only returns synchronization jobs with the Status field equal to the
          specified status.

          Possible values:

          o FAILED

          o SUCCEEDED

          o SYNCING

          o INCOMPLETE

          o STOPPING

          o ABORTED

          o SYNCING_INDEXING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       history -> (list)
          A history of synchronization jobs for the data source connector.

          (structure)
              Provides information about an Amazon Q Business data source con-
              nector synchronization job.

              executionId -> (string)
                 The identifier of a data source synchronization job.

              startTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  Unix time stamp when the data source synchronization job
                 started.

              endTime -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix timestamp when the synchronization job completed.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the synchronization job. When the Status  field
                 is set to SUCCEEDED , the synchronization job is done. If the
                 status code is FAILED , the ErrorCode and ErrorMessage fields
                 give you the reason for the failure.

              error -> (structure)
                 If  the  Status  field is set to FAILED , the ErrorCode field
                 indicates the reason the synchronization failed.

                 errorMessage -> (string)
                     The message explaining the data source sync error.

                 errorCode -> (string)
                     The code associated with the data source sync error.

              dataSourceErrorCode -> (string)
                 If the reason that the synchronization failed is  due  to  an
                 error  with the underlying data source, this field contains a
                 code that identifies the error.

              metrics -> (structure)
                 Maps a batch delete  document  request  to  a  specific  data
                 source sync job. This is optional and should only be supplied
                 when documents are deleted by a data source connector.

                 documentsAdded -> (string)
                     The current count of documents added from the data source
                     during the data source sync.

                 documentsModified -> (string)
                     The  current  count  of  documents  modified  in the data
                     source during the data source sync.

                 documentsDeleted -> (string)
                     The current count of  documents  deleted  from  the  data
                     source during the data source sync.

                 documentsFailed -> (string)
                     The  current  count of documents that failed to sync from
                     the data source during the data source sync.

                 documentsScanned -> (string)
                     The current count of documents  crawled  by  the  ongoing
                     sync job in the data source.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  the response is truncated, Amazon Q Business returns this token.
          You can use this token in any subsequent  request  to  retrieve  the
          next set of jobs.
