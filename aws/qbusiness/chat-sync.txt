NAME
       chat-sync -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts or continues a non-streaming Amazon Q Business conversation.

       chat-sync  uses  document  type  values. Document types follow the JSON
       data model where valid values are: strings,  numbers,  booleans,  null,
       arrays,  and  objects. For command input, options and nested parameters
       that are labeled with the type  document  must  be  provided  as  JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.
