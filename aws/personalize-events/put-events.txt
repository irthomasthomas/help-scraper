OPTIONS
       --tracking-id (string)
          The tracking ID for the event. The ID is generated by a call to  the
          CreateEventTracker API.

       --user-id (string)
          The user associated with the event.

       --session-id (string)
          The  session  ID  associated with the user's visit. Your application
          generates the sessionId when a user first  visits  your  website  or
          uses  your application. Amazon Personalize uses the sessionId to as-
          sociate events with the user before they log in. For  more  informa-
          tion, see Recording item interaction events .

       --event-list (list)
          A list of event data from the session.

          (structure)
              Represents  item  interaction  event  information sent using the
              PutEvents API.

              eventId -> (string)
                 An ID associated with the event. If an event ID is  not  pro-
                 vided,  Amazon  Personalize  generates  a  unique  ID for the
                 event. An event ID is not used as an input to the model. Ama-
                 zon  Personalize  uses  the  event  ID  to distinguish unique
                 events. Any subsequent events after the first with  the  same
                 event ID are not used in model training.

              eventType -> (string)
                 The  type  of event, such as click or download. This property
                 corresponds to the EVENT_TYPE field of your Item interactions
                 dataset's  schema  and depends on the types of events you are
                 tracking.

              eventValue -> (float)
                 The event value that corresponds to the EVENT_VALUE field  of
                 the Item interactions schema.

              itemId -> (string)
                 The  item ID key that corresponds to the ITEM_ID field of the
                 Item interactions dataset's schema.

              properties -> (string)
                 A string map of event-specific data that you might choose  to
                 record.  For  example,  if a user rates a movie on your site,
                 other than movie ID (itemId ) and rating (eventValue ) ,  you
                 might also send the number of movie ratings made by the user.

                 Each  item in the map consists of a key-value pair. For exam-
                 ple,
                     {"numberOfRatings": "12"}

                 The keys use camel case names that match the  fields  in  the
                 Item interactions dataset's schema. In the above example, the
                 numberOfRatings would match the 'NUMBER_OF_RATINGS' field de-
                 fined in the Item interactions dataset's schema.

                 The  following  can't be included as a keyword for properties
                 (case insensitive).

                 o userId

                 o sessionId

                 o eventType

                 o timestamp

                 o recommendationId

                 o impression

              sentAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp (in Unix time) on  the  client  side  when  the
                 event occurred.

              recommendationId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the list of recommendations that contains the item
                 the user interacted with. Provide a recommendationId to  have
                 Amazon  Personalize implicitly record the recommendations you
                 show your user as impressions data. Or provide a  recommenda-
                 tionId  if you use a metric attribution to measure the impact
                 of recommendations.

                 For more  information  on  recording  impressions  data,  see
                 Recording impressions data . For more information on creating
                 a metric attribution see Measuring impact of  recommendations
                 .

              impression -> (list)
                 A  list of item IDs that represents the sequence of items you
                 have shown the  user.  For  example,  ["itemId1",  "itemId2",
                 "itemId3"]  .  Provide a list of items to manually record im-
                 pressions data for an event. For more information on  record-
                 ing impressions data, see Recording impressions data .

                 (string)

              metricAttribution -> (structure)
                 Contains  information about the metric attribution associated
                 with an event. For more  information  about  metric  attribu-
                 tions, see Measuring impact of recommendations .

                 eventAttributionSource -> (string)
                     The source of the event, such as a third party.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          eventId=string,eventType=string,eventValue=float,itemId=string,properties=string,sentAt=timestamp,recommendationId=string,impression=string,string,metricAttribution={eventAttributionSource=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "eventId": "string",
              "eventType": "string",
              "eventValue": float,
              "itemId": "string",
              "properties": "string",
              "sentAt": timestamp,
              "recommendationId": "string",
              "impression": ["string", ...],
              "metricAttribution": {
                "eventAttributionSource": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.
