NETWORKFLOWMONITOR()                                      NETWORKFLOWMONITOR()



NAME
       networkflowmonitor -

DESCRIPTION
       Network Flow Monitor is a feature of Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor-
       ing that provides visibility into the performance of network flows  for
       your  Amazon  Web  Services workloads, between instances in subnets, as
       well as to and from Amazon Web Services. Lightweight  agents  that  you
       install  on  the instances capture performance metrics for your network
       flows, such as packet loss and latency, and send them  to  the  Network
       Flow  Monitor  backend. Then, you can view and analyze metrics from the
       top contributors for each metric type, to help troubleshoot issues.

       In addition, when you create a monitor, Network Flow Monitor provides a
       network health indicator (NHI) that informs you whether there were Ama-
       zon Web Services network issues for one or more of  the  network  flows
       tracked  by  a  monitor, during a time period that you choose. By using
       this value, you can independently determine if the Amazon Web  Services
       network  is  impacting  your  workload during a specific time frame, to
       help you focus troubleshooting efforts.

       To learn more about Network Flow Monitor, see the Network Flow  Monitor
       User Guide in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
