OPTIONS
       --source-domain-info (structure)
          Specifies the `` DomainInformation`` for  the  source  Elasticsearch
          domain.

          OwnerId -> (string)

          DomainName -> (string)
              The  name  of  an  Elasticsearch domain. Domain names are unique
              across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region. Do-
              main  names  start  with  a letter or number and can contain the
              following characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

          Region -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OwnerId=string,DomainName=string,Region=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "OwnerId": "string",
            "DomainName": "string",
            "Region": "string"
          }

       --destination-domain-info (structure)
          Specifies the `` DomainInformation`` for  the  destination  Elastic-
          search domain.

          OwnerId -> (string)

          DomainName -> (string)
              The  name  of  an  Elasticsearch domain. Domain names are unique
              across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region. Do-
              main  names  start  with  a letter or number and can contain the
              following characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

          Region -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OwnerId=string,DomainName=string,Region=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "OwnerId": "string",
            "DomainName": "string",
            "Region": "string"
          }

       --connection-alias (string)
          Specifies the connection alias that will be used by the customer for
          this connection.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
