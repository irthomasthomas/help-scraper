ASSOCIATE-SUBNETS()                                        ASSOCIATE-SUBNETS()



NAME
       associate-subnets -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates the specified subnets in the Amazon VPC to the firewall. You
       can specify one subnet for each of the Availability Zones that the  VPC
       spans.

       This  request  creates an Network Firewall firewall endpoint in each of
       the subnets. To enable the firewall's protections, you must also modify
       the VPC's route tables for each subnet's Availability Zone, to redirect
       the traffic that's coming into and going out of the  zone  through  the
       firewall endpoint.

OPTIONS
       --update-token (string)
          An  optional  token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network
          Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the  firewall.
          The  token  marks  the state of the firewall resource at the time of
          the request.

          To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the  token  in
          your  update  request.  Without the token, Network Firewall performs
          your updates regardless of whether the firewall  has  changed  since
          you last retrieved it.

          To  make  a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in
          your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure  that
          the  firewall  hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has
          changed, the operation fails with an InvalidTokenException . If this
          happens,  retrieve  the  firewall  again to get a current copy of it
          with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the oper-
          ation again using the new token.

       --firewall-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --subnet-mappings (list)
          The IDs of the subnets that you want to associate with the firewall.

          (structure)
              The ID for a subnet that you want to associate  with  the  fire-
              wall.  This is used with  CreateFirewall and  AssociateSubnets .
              Network Firewall creates an instance of the associated  firewall
              in  each  subnet that you specify, to filter traffic in the sub-
              net's Availability Zone.

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the subnet.

              IPAddressType -> (string)
                 The subnet's IP address type. You can't change the IP address
                 type after you create the subnet.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetId=string,IPAddressType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SubnetId": "string",
              "IPAddressType": "DUALSTACK"|"IPV4"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FirewallArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

       FirewallName -> (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

          (structure)
              The  ID  for  a subnet that you want to associate with the fire-
              wall. This is used with  CreateFirewall and  AssociateSubnets  .
              Network  Firewall creates an instance of the associated firewall
              in each subnet that you specify, to filter traffic in  the  sub-
              net's Availability Zone.

              SubnetId -> (string)

              IPAddressType -> (string)
                 The subnet's IP address type. You can't change the IP address
                 type after you create the subnet.

       UpdateToken -> (string)
          An optional token that you can use for optimistic  locking.  Network
          Firewall  returns a token to your requests that access the firewall.
          The token marks the state of the firewall resource at  the  time  of
          the request.

          To  make  an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in
