NAME
       update-tls-inspection-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the TLS inspection configuration settings for the specified TLS
       inspection configuration. You use a  TLS  inspection  configuration  by
       reference  in  one or more firewall policies. When you modify a TLS in-
       spection configuration, you modify all firewall policies that  use  the
       TLS inspection configuration.

       To  update  a  TLS inspection configuration, first call  DescribeTLSIn-
       spectionConfiguration to retrieve the current   TLSInspectionConfigura-
       tion  object, update the object as needed, and then provide the updated
       object to this call.

OPTIONS
       --tls-inspection-configuration-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the TLS inspection configuration.

       --tls-inspection-configuration-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the TLS inspection configuration. You  can't
          change  the  name of a TLS inspection configuration after you create
          it.

       --tls-inspection-configuration (structure)
          The object that defines a TLS inspection configuration. This,  along
          with  TLSInspectionConfigurationResponse , define the TLS inspection
          configuration. You can retrieve all objects  for  a  TLS  inspection
          configuration by calling  DescribeTLSInspectionConfiguration .

          Network  Firewall  uses  a  TLS  inspection configuration to decrypt
          traffic. Network Firewall re-encrypts the traffic before sending  it
          to its destination.

          To  use  a TLS inspection configuration, you add it to a new Network
          Firewall firewall policy, then you apply the firewall  policy  to  a
          firewall.  Network  Firewall  acts as a proxy service to decrypt and
          inspect inbound traffic. You can reference a TLS inspection configu-
          ration  from  more than one firewall policy, and you can use a fire-
          wall policy in more than one firewall. For  more  information  about
          using  TLS inspection configurations, see Decrypting SSL/TLS traffic
          with TLS inspection configurations in the Network Firewall Developer
          Guide .

          ServerCertificateConfigurations -> (list)
              Lists  the server certificate configurations that are associated
              with the TLS configuration.

              (structure)
                 Configures the associated Certificate Manager Secure  Sockets
                 Layer/Transport  Layer Security (SSL/TLS) server certificates
                 and scope settings Network Firewall uses to  decrypt  traffic
                 in  a   TLSInspectionConfiguration  .  For  information about
                 working with SSL/TLS certificates  for  TLS  inspection,  see
                 Requirements  for  using SSL/TLS server certficiates with TLS
                 inspection configurations in the Network  Firewall  Developer
                 Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     If  a  server  certificate  that's  associated  with your
                     TLSInspectionConfiguration is revoked,  deleted,  or  ex-
                     pired it can result in client-side TLS errors.

                        sociated with a   ServerCertificateConfiguration  used
                        in a  TLSInspectionConfiguration . You must request or
                        import a SSL/TLS certificate into ACM for each  domain
                        Network Firewall needs to decrypt and inspect. Network
                        Firewall uses  the  SSL/TLS  certificates  to  decrypt
                        specified  inbound SSL/TLS traffic going to your fire-
                        wall. For information about working with  certificates

       --description (string)
          A description of the TLS inspection configuration.

       --encryption-configuration (structure)
          A complex type that contains the Amazon Web Services KMS  encryption
          configuration settings for your TLS inspection configuration.

          KeyId -> (string)
              The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)
              customer managed key. You can use any  of  the  key  identifiers
              that  KMS  supports, unless you're using a key that's managed by
              another account. If you're using a key managed  by  another  ac-
              count,  then  specify the key ARN. For more information, see Key
              ID in the Amazon Web Services KMS Developer Guide .

          Type -> (string)
              The type of Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption of
              your Network Firewall resources.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyId=string,Type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KeyId": "string",
            "Type": "CUSTOMER_KMS"|"AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY"
          }

       --update-token (string)
          A  token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a to-
          ken to your requests that access the TLS  inspection  configuration.
          The  token  marks  the state of the TLS inspection configuration re-
          source at the time of the request.

          To make changes to the TLS inspection configuration, you provide the
          token  in  your  request.  Network Firewall uses the token to ensure
          that the TLS inspection configuration hasn't changed since you  last
          retrieved  it.  If  it  has changed, the operation fails with an In-
          validTokenException . If this happens, retrieve the  TLS  inspection
          configuration  again  to get a current copy of it with a current to-
          ken. Reapply your changes as needed, then try  the  operation  again
          using the new token.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       UpdateToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a  to-
          ken  to  your requests that access the TLS inspection configuration.
          The token marks the state of the TLS  inspection  configuration  re-
          source at the time of the request.

          To make changes to the TLS inspection configuration, you provide the
          token in your request. Network Firewall uses  the  token  to  ensure
          that  the TLS inspection configuration hasn't changed since you last
          retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation  fails  with  an  In-
          validTokenException  .  If this happens, retrieve the TLS inspection
          configuration again to get a current copy of it with a  current  to-
          ken.  Reapply  your  changes as needed, then try the operation again
          using the new token.

       TLSInspectionConfigurationResponse -> (structure)
          The high-level properties of a TLS inspection  configuration.  This,
          along  with the  TLSInspectionConfiguration , define the TLS inspec-
          tion configuration. You can retrieve all objects for a  TLS  inspec-
          tion configuration by calling  DescribeTLSInspectionConfiguration .

              A description of the TLS inspection configuration.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

              (structure)
                 A  key:value  pair associated with an Amazon Web Services re-
                 source. The key:value pair can be anything you define.  Typi-
                 cally,  the  tag key represents a category (such as "environ-
                 ment") and the tag value represents a specific  value  within
                 that  category  (such  as  "test," "development," or "produc-
                 tion"). You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services
                 resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag key to describe a category of  information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
                     category,  such  as  "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values
                     are case-sensitive.

                 tifiers  that  KMS supports, unless you're using a key that's
                 managed by another account. If you're using a key managed  by
                 another  account, then specify the key ARN. For more informa-
                 tion, see Key ID in the Amazon  Web  Services  KMS  Developer
                 Guide .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption
