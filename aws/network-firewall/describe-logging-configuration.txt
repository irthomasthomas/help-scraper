OPTIONS
       --firewall-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       FirewallArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

       LoggingConfiguration -> (structure)
          Defines how Network Firewall performs logging for a  Firewall .

          LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
              Defines  the  logging  destinations for the logs for a firewall.
              Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups.

              (structure)
                 Defines where Network Firewall sends logs  for  the  firewall
                 for one log type. This is used in  LoggingConfiguration . You
                 can send each type of log to an Amazon S3  bucket,  a  Cloud-
                 Watch log group, or a Firehose delivery stream.

                 Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups. You
                 can save alert, flow, and TLS log types.

                 LogType -> (string)
                     The type of log to record. You can record  the  following
                     types of logs from your Network Firewall stateful engine.

                     o ALERT  -  Logs  for  traffic that matches your stateful
                       rules and that have an action that sends  an  alert.  A
                       stateful  rule  sends alerts for the rule actions DROP,
                       ALERT, and REJECT. For more information, see  Stateful-
                       Rule .

                     o FLOW - Standard network traffic flow logs. The stateful
                       rules engine records flow logs for all network  traffic
                       that  it  receives.  Each  flow log record captures the
                       network flow for a  specific  standard  stateless  rule
                       group.

                     o TLS  -  Logs for events that are related to TLS inspec-
                       tion. For  more  information,  see  Inspecting  SSL/TLS
                       traffic  with TLS inspection configurations in the Net-
                       work Firewall Developer Guide .

                 LogDestinationType -> (string)
                     The type of storage destination to send  these  logs  to.
                     You  can  send  logs to an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch
                     log group, or a Firehose delivery stream.

                 LogDestination -> (map)
                     The named location for the logs, provided in a  key:value
                     mapping that is specific to the chosen destination type.

                     o For  an  Amazon  S3  bucket,  provide  the  name of the
                       bucket, with key bucketName , and optionally provide  a
                       prefix, with key prefix .  The following example speci-
                       fies an Amazon S3 bucket named  DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET  and
                       the prefix alerts :   "LogDestination": { "bucketName":
                       "DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET", "prefix": "alerts" }

                     o For a CloudWatch log group, provide  the  name  of  the
                       CloudWatch log group, with key logGroup . The following
                       example specifies a log group named  alert-log-group  :
                       "LogDestination": { "logGroup": "alert-log-group" }

                     o For a Firehose delivery stream, provide the name of the
                       delivery stream, with key deliveryStream . The  follow-
                       ing example specifies a delivery stream named alert-de-
                       livery-stream :   "LogDestination": { "deliveryStream":
                       "alert-delivery-stream" }

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)
