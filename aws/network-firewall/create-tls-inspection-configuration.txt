CREATE-TLS-INSPECTION-CONFIGURATION()    CREATE-TLS-INSPECTION-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       create-tls-inspection-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Network Firewall TLS inspection configuration. A TLS inspec-
       tion configuration contains the Certificate Manager certificate  refer-
       ences  that  Network  Firewall  uses  to decrypt and re-encrypt inbound
       traffic.

       After you create a TLS inspection configuration, you associate it  with
       a new firewall policy.

       To  update  the  settings  for a TLS inspection configuration, use  Up-
       dateTLSInspectionConfiguration .

       To manage a TLS inspection configuration's tags, use the standard  Ama-
       zon  Web  Services  resource tagging operations,  ListTagsForResource ,
       TagResource , and  UntagResource .

       To retrieve information about TLS inspection configurations, use  List-
       TLSInspectionConfigurations and  DescribeTLSInspectionConfiguration .

       For   more   information   about  TLS  inspection  configurations,  see
       Decrypting SSL/TLS traffic with TLS inspection  configurations  in  the
       Network Firewall Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --tls-inspection-configuration-name (string)
          The  descriptive name of the TLS inspection configuration. You can't
          change the name of a TLS inspection configuration after  you  create
          it.

       --tls-inspection-configuration (structure)
          The  object that defines a TLS inspection configuration. This, along
          with  TLSInspectionConfigurationResponse , define the TLS inspection
          configuration.  You  can  retrieve  all objects for a TLS inspection
          configuration by calling  DescribeTLSInspectionConfiguration .

          Network Firewall uses a  TLS  inspection  configuration  to  decrypt
          traffic.  Network Firewall re-encrypts the traffic before sending it
          to its destination.

          To use a TLS inspection configuration, you add it to a  new  Network
          Firewall  firewall  policy,  then you apply the firewall policy to a
          firewall. Network Firewall acts as a proxy service  to  decrypt  and
          inspect inbound traffic. You can reference a TLS inspection configu-
          ration from more than one firewall policy, and you can use  a  fire-
          wall  policy  in  more than one firewall. For more information about
          using TLS inspection configurations, see Decrypting SSL/TLS  traffic
          with TLS inspection configurations in the Network Firewall Developer
          Guide .

          ServerCertificateConfigurations -> (list)
              Lists the server certificate configurations that are  associated
              with the TLS configuration.

              (structure)
                 Configures  the associated Certificate Manager Secure Sockets
                 Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) server  certificates
                 and  scope  settings Network Firewall uses to decrypt traffic
                 in a   TLSInspectionConfiguration  .  For  information  about
                 working  with  SSL/TLS  certificates  for TLS inspection, see
                 Requirements for using SSL/TLS server certficiates  with  TLS
                 inspection  configurations  in the Network Firewall Developer
                 Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     If a  server  certificate  that's  associated  with  your
                     TLSInspectionConfiguration  is  revoked,  deleted, or ex-
                     pired it can result in client-side TLS errors.

                        sociated  with  a  ServerCertificateConfiguration used
                        in a  TLSInspectionConfiguration . You must request or
                        import  a SSL/TLS certificate into ACM for each domain
                        Network Firewall needs to decrypt and inspect. Network
                        Firewall  uses  the  SSL/TLS  certificates  to decrypt
                        specified inbound SSL/TLS traffic going to your  fire-
                        wall.  For information about working with certificates

              A  key:value  pair  associated  with  an Amazon Web Services re-
              source. The key:value pair can be  anything  you  define.  Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment")
              and the tag value represents a specific value within that  cate-
              gory  (such  as "test," "development," or "production"). You can

              Key -> (string)
                 The part of the key:value pair that defines a  tag.  You  can
                 use  a tag key to describe a category of information, such as
                 "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 The part of the key:value pair that defines a  tag.  You  can
                 use  a  tag value to describe a specific value within a cate-
                 gory, such  as  "companyA"  or  "companyB."  Tag  values  are
                 case-sensitive.

       --encryption-configuration (structure)
          A  complex  type that contains optional Amazon Web Services Key Man-
          agement Service (KMS) encryption settings for your Network  Firewall
          resources. Your data is encrypted by default with an Amazon Web Ser-
          vices owned key that Amazon Web Services owns and manages  for  you.
          You  can  use  either  the Amazon Web Services owned key, or provide
          your own customer managed key. To learn more about KMS encryption of
          your  Network Firewall resources, see Encryption at rest with Amazon
          Web Services Key Managment Service in the Network Firewall Developer
          Guide .

          KeyId -> (string)
              The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)
              customer managed key. You can use any  of  the  key  identifiers
              that  KMS  supports, unless you're using a key that's managed by
              another account. If you're using a key managed  by  another  ac-
              count,  then  specify the key ARN. For more information, see Key
              ID in the Amazon Web Services KMS Developer Guide .

          Type -> (string)
              The type of Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption of

          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       UpdateToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a  to-
          ken  to  your requests that access the TLS inspection configuration.
          The token marks the state of the TLS  inspection  configuration  re-
          source at the time of the request.

          To make changes to the TLS inspection configuration, you provide the
          token in your request. Network Firewall uses  the  token  to  ensure
          that  the TLS inspection configuration hasn't changed since you last
          retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation  fails  with  an  In-
          validTokenException  .  If this happens, retrieve the TLS inspection
          configuration again to get a current copy of it with a  current  to-
          ken.  Reapply  your  changes as needed, then try the operation again
          using the new token.

              tion.

          TLSInspectionConfigurationName -> (string)
              The descriptive name of the TLS  inspection  configuration.  You
              can't  change  the  name of a TLS inspection configuration after
              you create it.

          TLSInspectionConfigurationId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the TLS inspection  configuration.  This
              ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You
              provide it to operations such as update and delete.

          TLSInspectionConfigurationStatus -> (string)
              Detailed information about the current status of  a   TLSInspec-
              tionConfiguration  .  You can retrieve this for a TLS inspection
              configuration by calling  DescribeTLSInspectionConfiguration and
              providing the TLS inspection configuration name and ARN.

                 cally,  the  tag key represents a category (such as "environ-
                 ment") and the tag value represents a specific  value  within
                 that  category  (such  as  "test," "development," or "produc-
                 tion"). You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services
