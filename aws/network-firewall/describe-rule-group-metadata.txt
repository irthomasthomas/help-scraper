OPTIONS
       --rule-group-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of
          a rule group after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --rule-group-arn (string)
          The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of
          a rule group after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --type (string)
          Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or  stateful.  If  the
          rule  group  is  stateless,  it  contains  stateless rules. If it is
          stateful, it contains stateful rules.

          NOTE:
              This setting is required for requests that do  not  include  the
              RuleGroupARN .

          Possible values:

          o STATELESS

          o STATEFUL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RuleGroupArn -> (string)
          The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of
          a rule group after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       RuleGroupName -> (string)
          The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of
          a rule group after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       Description -> (string)
          Returns the metadata objects for the specified rule group.

       Type -> (string)
          Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or  stateful.  If  the
          rule  group  is  stateless,  it  contains  stateless rules. If it is
          stateful, it contains stateful rules.

          NOTE:
              This setting is required for requests that do  not  include  the
              RuleGroupARN .

       Capacity -> (integer)
          The  maximum  operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule
          group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a  rule  group,
          you  are  limited  to this capacity. When you reference a rule group
          from a firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves this capacity  for
          the rule group.

          You  can  retrieve  the  capacity  that would be required for a rule
          group before you create the rule group by  calling   CreateRuleGroup
          with DryRun set to TRUE .

       StatefulRuleOptions -> (structure)
          Additional  options  governing how Network Firewall handles the rule
          group. You can only use these for stateful rule groups.

          RuleOrder -> (string)
              Indicates how to manage the order of the rule evaluation for the
              rule group. DEFAULT_ACTION_ORDER is the default behavior. State-
              ful rules are provided to the rule engine as Suricata compatible
              strings,  and Suricata evaluates them based on certain settings.
              For more information, see Evaluation order for stateful rules in
              the Network Firewall Developer Guide .

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The last time that the rule group was changed.
