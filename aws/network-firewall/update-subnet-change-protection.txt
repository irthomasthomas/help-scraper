OPTIONS
       --update-token (string)
          An  optional  token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network
          Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the  firewall.
          The  token  marks  the state of the firewall resource at the time of
          the request.

          To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the  token  in
          your  update  request.  Without the token, Network Firewall performs
          your updates regardless of whether the firewall  has  changed  since
          you last retrieved it.

          To  make  a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in
          your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure  that
          the  firewall  hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has
          changed, the operation fails with an InvalidTokenException . If this
          happens,  retrieve  the  firewall  again to get a current copy of it
          with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the oper-
          ation again using the new token.

       --firewall-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --subnet-change-protection | --no-subnet-change-protection (boolean)
          A setting indicating  whether  the  firewall  is  protected  against
          changes  to  the  subnet  associations.  Use this setting to protect
          against accidentally modifying the subnet associations for  a  fire-
          wall  that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation ini-
          tializes this setting to TRUE .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       UpdateToken -> (string)
          An  optional  token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network
          Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the  firewall.

       FirewallArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

       FirewallName -> (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

       SubnetChangeProtection -> (boolean)
          A setting indicating  whether  the  firewall  is  protected  against
          changes  to  the  subnet  associations.  Use this setting to protect
          against accidentally modifying the subnet associations for  a  fire-
          wall  that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation ini-
          tializes this setting to TRUE .
