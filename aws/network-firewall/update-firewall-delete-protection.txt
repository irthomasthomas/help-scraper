DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  flag,  DeleteProtection  , which indicates whether it is

       wall  is protected against deletion. This setting helps protect against
       accidentally deleting a firewall that's in use.

OPTIONS
       --update-token (string)
          An optional token that you can use for optimistic  locking.  Network
          Firewall  returns a token to your requests that access the firewall.
          The token marks the state of the firewall resource at  the  time  of
          the request.

          To  make  an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in
          your update request. Without the token,  Network  Firewall  performs
          your  updates  regardless  of whether the firewall has changed since
          you last retrieved it.

          To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the  token  in
          your  update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that
          the firewall hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If  it  has
          changed, the operation fails with an InvalidTokenException . If this
          happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a  current  copy  of  it
          with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the oper-
          ation again using the new token.

       --firewall-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --delete-protection | --no-delete-protection (boolean)
          A  flag  indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall. A
          setting of TRUE indicates that the  firewall  is  protected  against
          deletion.  Use this setting to protect against accidentally deleting
          a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation
          initializes this flag to TRUE .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FirewallArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

       FirewallName -> (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

       DeleteProtection -> (boolean)
          A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the  firewall.  A
          setting  of  TRUE  indicates  that the firewall is protected against
          deletion. Use this setting to protect against accidentally  deleting
          a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation
          initializes this flag to TRUE .

       UpdateToken -> (string)
          An optional token that you can use for optimistic  locking.  Network
          Firewall  returns a token to your requests that access the firewall.
          The token marks the state of the firewall resource at  the  time  of
          the request.

          To  make  an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in
          your update request. Without the token,  Network  Firewall  performs
          your  updates  regardless  of whether the firewall has changed since
          you last retrieved it.

          To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the  token  in
          your  update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that
          the firewall hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If  it  has
          changed, the operation fails with an InvalidTokenException . If this
          happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a  current  copy  of  it
          with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the oper-
          ation again using the new token.
