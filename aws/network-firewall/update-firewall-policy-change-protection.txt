UPDATE-FIREWALL-POLICY-CHANGE-PROTECUPDATE-FIREWALL-POLICY-CHANGE-PROTECTION()



NAME
       update-firewall-policy-change-protection -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  flag,  ChangeProtection  , which indicates whether it is
       possible to change the firewall. If the flag is set to TRUE , the fire-
       wall  is protected from changes. This setting helps protect against ac-
       cidentally changing a firewall that's in use.

OPTIONS
       --update-token (string)
          An optional token that you can use for optimistic  locking.  Network
          Firewall  returns a token to your requests that access the firewall.
          The token marks the state of the firewall resource at  the  time  of
          the request.

          To  make  an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in
          your update request. Without the token,  Network  Firewall  performs
          your  updates  regardless  of whether the firewall has changed since
          you last retrieved it.

          To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the  token  in
          your  update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that
          the firewall hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If  it  has
          changed, the operation fails with an InvalidTokenException . If this
          happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a  current  copy  of  it
          with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the oper-
          ation again using the new token.

       --firewall-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-policy-change-protection  | --no-firewall-policy-change-pro-
       tection (boolean)
          A setting indicating whether the firewall  is  protected  against  a
          change  to the firewall policy association. Use this setting to pro-
          tect against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a  fire-
          wall  that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation ini-
          tializes this setting to TRUE .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       UpdateToken -> (string)
          An optional token that you can use for optimistic  locking.  Network
          Firewall  returns a token to your requests that access the firewall.
          The token marks the state of the firewall resource at  the  time  of
          the request.

          To  make  an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in
          your update request. Without the token,  Network  Firewall  performs
          your  updates  regardless  of whether the firewall has changed since

       FirewallArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

       FirewallName -> (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

       FirewallPolicyChangeProtection -> (boolean)
          A  setting  indicating  whether  the firewall is protected against a
          change to the firewall policy association. Use this setting to  pro-
          tect  against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a fire-
          wall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation  ini-
          tializes this setting to TRUE .
