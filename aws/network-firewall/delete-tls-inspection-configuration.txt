OPTIONS
       --tls-inspection-configuration-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the TLS inspection configuration.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --tls-inspection-configuration-name (string)
          The  descriptive name of the TLS inspection configuration. You can't
          change the name of a TLS inspection configuration after  you  create
          it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TLSInspectionConfigurationResponse -> (structure)
          The  high-level  properties of a TLS inspection configuration. This,
          along with the  TLSInspectionConfiguration , define the TLS  inspec-
          tion  configuration.  You can retrieve all objects for a TLS inspec-
          tion configuration by calling  DescribeTLSInspectionConfiguration .

          TLSInspectionConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the TLS inspection  configura-
              tion.

          TLSInspectionConfigurationName -> (string)
              The  descriptive  name  of the TLS inspection configuration. You
              can't change the name of a TLS  inspection  configuration  after
              you create it.

          TLSInspectionConfigurationId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier for the TLS inspection configuration. This
              ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You
              provide it to operations such as update and delete.

          TLSInspectionConfigurationStatus -> (string)
              Detailed  information  about the current status of a  TLSInspec-
              tionConfiguration . You can retrieve this for a  TLS  inspection
              configuration by calling  DescribeTLSInspectionConfiguration and
              providing the TLS inspection configuration name and ARN.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the TLS inspection configuration.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

              (structure)
                 A key:value pair associated with an Amazon Web  Services  re-
                 source.  The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typi-
                 cally, the tag key represents a category (such  as  "environ-
                 ment")  and  the tag value represents a specific value within
                 that category (such as  "test,"  "development,"  or  "produc-
                 tion"). You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services
                 resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The part of the key:value pair that defines  a  tag.  You
                     can  use a tag key to describe a category of information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The part of the key:value pair that defines  a  tag.  You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
                     category, such as "companyA" or  "companyB."  Tag  values
                     are case-sensitive.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time that the TLS inspection configuration was changed.

          NumberOfAssociations -> (integer)
              The  number  of  firewall  policies that use this TLS inspection
              configuration.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains the Amazon Web Services KMS encryp-
              tion  configuration  settings for your TLS inspection configura-
              tion.

              KeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon  Web  Services  Key  Management  Service
                 (KMS)  customer managed key. You can use any of the key iden-
                 tifiers that KMS supports, unless you're using a  key  that's
                 managed  by another account. If you're using a key managed by
                 another account, then specify the key ARN. For more  informa-
                 tion,  see  Key  ID  in the Amazon Web Services KMS Developer
                 Guide .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption
                 of your Network Firewall resources.
