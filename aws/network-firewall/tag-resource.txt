TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  the  specified tags to the specified resource. Tags are key:value
       pairs that you can use to categorize and  manage  your  resources,  for
       purposes  like billing. For example, you might set the tag key to "cus-
       tomer" and the value to the customer name or ID. You can specify one or
       more  tags  to  add to each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags
       for a resource.

       You can tag the Amazon Web Services resources that you  manage  through
       Network Firewall: firewalls, firewall policies, and rule groups.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.

       --tags (list)
          (structure)
              A  key:value  pair  associated  with  an Amazon Web Services re-
              source. The key:value pair can be  anything  you  define.  Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment")
              and the tag value represents a specific value within that  cate-
              gory  (such  as "test," "development," or "production"). You can
              add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The part of the key:value pair that defines a  tag.  You  can
                 use  a tag key to describe a category of information, such as
                 "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 The part of the key:value pair that defines a  tag.  You  can
                 use  a  tag value to describe a specific value within a cate-
                 gory, such  as  "companyA"  or  "companyB."  Tag  values  are
                 case-sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
