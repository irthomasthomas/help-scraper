OPTIONS
       --rule-group-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of
          a rule group after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --rule-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --type (string)
          Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or  stateful.  If  the
          rule  group  is  stateless,  it  contains  stateless rules. If it is
          stateful, it contains stateful rules.

          NOTE:
              This setting is required for requests that do  not  include  the
              RuleGroupARN .

          Possible values:

          o STATELESS

          o STATEFUL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RuleGroupResponse -> (structure)
          The high-level properties of a rule  group.  This,  along  with  the
          RuleGroup  , define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects for
          a rule group by calling  DescribeRuleGroup .

          RuleGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

              NOTE:
                 If this response is for a create request that had DryRun  set
                 to  TRUE , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't attached
                 to a valid resource.

          RuleGroupName -> (string)
              The descriptive name of the rule group.  You  can't  change  the
              name of a rule group after you create it.

          RuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the rule group.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the rule group.

          Type -> (string)
              Indicates  whether  the  rule group is stateless or stateful. If
              the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If  it
              is stateful, it contains stateful rules.

          Capacity -> (integer)
              The  maximum  operating  resources that this rule group can use.
              Rule group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule
              group,  you  are  limited to this capacity. When you reference a
              rule group from a firewall  policy,  Network  Firewall  reserves
              this capacity for the rule group.

              You  can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule
              group before you create the rule group by  calling   CreateRule-
              Group with DryRun set to TRUE .

          RuleGroupStatus -> (string)
              Detailed information about the current status of a rule group.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

              (structure)
                 A  key:value  pair associated with an Amazon Web Services re-
                 source. The key:value pair can be anything you define.  Typi-
                 cally,  the  tag key represents a category (such as "environ-
                 ment") and the tag value represents a specific  value  within
                 that  category  (such  as  "test," "development," or "produc-
                 tion"). You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services
                 resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag key to describe a category of  information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
                     category,  such  as  "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values
                     are case-sensitive.

          ConsumedCapacity -> (integer)
              The number of capacity units  currently  consumed  by  the  rule
              group rules.

          NumberOfAssociations -> (integer)
              The number of firewall policies that use this rule group.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains the Amazon Web Services KMS encryp-
              tion configuration settings for your rule group.

              KeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon  Web  Services  Key  Management  Service
                 (KMS)  customer managed key. You can use any of the key iden-
                 tifiers that KMS supports, unless you're using a  key  that's
                 managed  by another account. If you're using a key managed by
                 another account, then specify the key ARN. For more  informa-
                 tion,  see  Key  ID  in the Amazon Web Services KMS Developer
                 Guide .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption
                 of your Network Firewall resources.

          SourceMetadata -> (structure)
              A  complex type that contains metadata about the rule group that
              your own rule group is copied from. You can use the metadata  to
              track the version updates made to the originating rule group.

              SourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the rule group that your
                 own rule group is copied from.

              SourceUpdateToken -> (string)
                 The update token of the  Amazon  Web  Services  managed  rule
                 group  that  your own rule group is copied from. To determine
                 the  update  token  for  the   managed   rule   group,   call
                 DescribeRuleGroup .

          SnsTopic -> (string)
              The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notification
              Service SNS topic that's used to record changes to  the  managed
              rule  group. You can subscribe to the SNS topic to receive noti-
              fications when the managed rule group is modified, such  as  for
              new  versions  and for version expiration. For more information,
              see the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide. .

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time that the rule group was changed.
