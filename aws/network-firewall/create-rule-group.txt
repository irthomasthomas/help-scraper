OPTIONS
       --rule-group-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of
          a rule group after you create it.

       --rule-group (structure)

              ting, but not both.

          RuleVariables -> (structure)
              Settings  that  are  available  for use in the rules in the rule
              group. You can only use these for stateful rule groups.

              IPSets -> (map)
                 A list of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR notation.

                 key -> (string)

                     A list of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR  nota-
                     tion. This is part of a  RuleVariables .

                     Definition -> (list)
                        The  list  of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR
                        notation.

                 A list of port ranges.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     A set of port ranges for use  in  the  rules  in  a  rule
                     group.

                     Definition -> (list)
                        The set of port ranges.

                        (string)

          ReferenceSets -> (structure)
              The list of a rule group's reference sets.

              IPSetReferences -> (map)
                 The list of IP set references.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Configures  one  or  more  IP  set references for a Suri-
                     cata-compatible rule group. This is used in   CreateRule-
                     Group or  UpdateRuleGroup . An IP set reference is a rule
                     variable that references resources that  you  create  and
                     manage in another Amazon Web Services service, such as an
                     Amazon VPC prefix list. Network Firewall  IP  set  refer-
                     ences  enable  you  to dynamically update the contents of
                     your rules. When you create, update, or  delete  the  re-
                     source you are referencing in your rule, Network Firewall
                     automatically  updates  the  rule's  content   with   the
                     changes.  For more information about IP set references in
                     Network Firewall, see Using IP set references in the Net-
                     work Firewall Developer Guide .

                     Network  Firewall  currently  supports  Amazon VPC prefix
                     lists and resource groups in IP set references.

                     ReferenceArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  resource  that
                        you are referencing in your rule group.

          RulesSource -> (structure)
              The stateful rules or stateless rules for the rule group.

              RulesString -> (string)
                 Stateful inspection criteria, provided in Suricata compatible
                 intrusion prevention  system  (IPS)  rules.  Suricata  is  an
                 open-source  network  IPS that includes a standard rule-based
                 language for network traffic inspection.

                 These rules contain the inspection criteria and the action to
                 take  for  traffic that matches the criteria, so this type of
                 rule group doesn't have a separate action setting.

              RulesSourceList -> (structure)
                 Stateful inspection criteria for a domain list rule group.

                 Targets -> (list)
                     The domains that you want to inspect for in your  traffic
                     flows. Valid domain specifications are the following:

                     o Explicit  names.  For  example, abc.example.com matches
                       only the domain abc.example.com .

                     o Names that use a domain wildcard,  which  you  indicate
                       with  an  initial  '.  '.  For example,``.example.com``
                       matches example.com and matches all subdomains of exam-
                       ple.com , such as abc.example.com and www.example.com .

                     (string)

                 TargetTypes -> (list)
                     The  protocols  you  want to inspect. Specify TLS_SNI for
                     HTTPS . Specify HTTP_HOST for HTTP . You can specify  ei-
                     ther or both.

                     (string)

                 GeneratedRulesType -> (string)
                     Whether  you  want to allow or deny access to the domains
                     in your target list.

              StatefulRules -> (list)
                 An array of individual stateful rules inspection criteria  to
                 be used together in a stateful rule group. Use this option to
                 specify simple Suricata rules with protocol, source and  des-
                 tination, ports, direction, and rule options. For information
                 about the Suricata Rules format, see Rules Format .

                 (structure)
                     A single Suricata  rules  specification,  for  use  in  a
                     stateful  rule group. Use this option to specify a simple
                     Suricata rule  with  protocol,  source  and  destination,
                     ports, direction, and rule options. For information about
                     the Suricata Rules format, see Rules Format .

                     Action -> (string)
                        Defines what Network Firewall should do with the pack-
                        ets in a traffic flow when the flow matches the state-
                        ful rule criteria. For all actions,  Network  Firewall
                        performs  the specified action and discontinues state-
                        ful inspection of the traffic flow.

                        The actions for a stateful rule are  defined  as  fol-
                        lows:

                        o PASS  -  Permits  the  packets to go to the intended
                          destination.

                        o DROP - Blocks the packets from going to the intended
                          destination and sends an alert log message, if alert
                          logging is configured in the  Firewall   LoggingCon-
                          figuration .

                        o ALERT  -  Permits  the packets to go to the intended
                          destination and sends an alert log message, if alert
                          logging is configured in the  Firewall   LoggingCon-
                          figuration .  You can use this action to test a rule
                          that  you intend to use to drop traffic. You can en-
                          able the rule with ALERT action, verify in the  logs
                          that  the rule is filtering as you want, then change
                          the action to DROP .

                     Header -> (structure)
                        The stateful inspection criteria for this  rule,  used
                        to inspect traffic flows.

                        Protocol -> (string)
                            The  protocol  to inspect for. To specify all, you
                            can use IP , because all  traffic  on  Amazon  Web
                            Services and on the internet is IP.

                        Source -> (string)
                            The  source IP address or address range to inspect
                            for, in CIDR notation. To match with any  address,
                            specify ANY .

                            Specify  an  IP address or a block of IP addresses
                            in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation.
                            Network  Firewall  supports all address ranges for
                            IPv4 and IPv6.

                            Examples:

                            o To configure Network Firewall to inspect for the
                              IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32 .

                            o To  configure Network Firewall to inspect for IP
                              addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify
                              192.0.2.0/24 .

                            o To configure Network Firewall to inspect for the
                              IP                                       address
                              1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify
                              1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128 .

                            o To configure Network Firewall to inspect for  IP
                              addresses                                   from
                              1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000       to
                              1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify
                              1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64 .

                            Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing .

                        SourcePort -> (string)
                            The source port to inspect for. You can specify an
                            individual port, for  example  1994  and  you  can
                            specify  a  port range, for example 1990:1994 . To
                            match with any port, specify ANY .

                        Direction -> (string)
                            The direction of traffic flow to inspect.  If  set
                            to  ANY  ,  the  inspection  matches bidirectional
                            traffic, both from the source to  the  destination
                            and  from the destination to the source. If set to
                            FORWARD , the inspection only matches traffic  go-
                            ing from the source to the destination.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            The destination IP address or address range to in-
                            spect for, in CIDR notation. To match with any ad-
                            dress, specify ANY .

                            Specify  an  IP address or a block of IP addresses
                            in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation.
                            Network  Firewall  supports all address ranges for
                            IPv4 and IPv6.

                        (structure)
                            Additional  settings  for a stateful rule. This is
                            part of the  StatefulRule configuration.

                            Keyword -> (string)
                               The keyword for the  Suricata  compatible  rule
                               option.  You must include a sid (signature ID),
                               and can optionally include other keywords.  For

                                          setting  to  define  the  flags that
                                          must be set and flags that must  not
                                          be  set  in  order for the packet to
                                          match. This setting can only specify
                                          values  that  are  also specified in
                                          the Masks setting.

                                          For the flags that are specified  in
                                          the  masks  setting,  the  following
                                          must  be  true  for  the  packet  to
                                          match:

                                          o The  ones  that  are  set  in this
                                            flags setting must be set  in  the
                                            packet.

                                          o The  ones that are not set in this
                                            flags setting must also not be set
                                            in the packet.

                                          (string)

                                      Masks -> (list)
                                          The  set of flags to consider in the
                                          inspection. To inspect all flags  in
                                          the  valid  values  list, leave this
                                          with no setting.

                                          (string)

                            Actions -> (list)
                               The actions to take on a  packet  that  matches
                               one  of  the  stateless rule definition's match
                               attributes. You must specify a standard  action
                               and you can add custom actions.

                               NOTE:
                                   Network Firewall only forwards a packet for
                                   stateful rule  inspection  if  you  specify
                                   aws:forward_to_sfe  for  a  rule  that  the
                                   packet matches, or if  the  packet  doesn't
                                   match  any  stateless  rule and you specify
                                   aws:forward_to_sfe  for  the   StatelessDe-
                                   faultActions  setting for the  FirewallPol-
                                   icy .

                               For every rule, you must specify exactly one of
                               the following standard actions.

                               o aws:pass - Discontinues all inspection of the
                                 packet and permits it to go to  its  intended
                                 destination.

                               o aws:drop - Discontinues all inspection of the
                                 packet and blocks it from going  to  its  in-
                                 tended destination.

                               o aws:forward_to_sfe  -  Discontinues stateless
                                 inspection of the packet and forwards  it  to
                                 the stateful rule engine for inspection.

                               Additionally,  you can specify a custom action.
                               To do this, you define a custom action by  name
                               and type, then provide the name you've assigned
                               to the action in this Actions setting. For  in-
                               formation  about the options, see  CustomAction
                               .

                               To provide more than one action  in  this  set-
                               ting,  separate  the settings with a comma. For
                               example, if you have  a  custom  PublishMetrics
                               action that you've named MyMetricsAction , then
                               you could specify the standard action  aws:pass
                               and the custom action with [aws:pass, MyMetric-
                               sAction] .

                               (string)

                        Priority -> (integer)
                            Indicates the order in which to run this rule rel-
                            ative  to  all of the rules that are defined for a
                            stateless rule group. Network  Firewall  evaluates
                            the rules in a rule group starting with the lowest
                            priority setting. You must ensure that the  prior-
                            ity settings are unique for the rule group.

                            Each  stateless rule group uses exactly one State-
                            lessRulesAndCustomActions object, and each  State-
                            lessRulesAndCustomActions   contains  exactly  one
                            StatelessRules object. To ensure  unique  priority
                            settings  for your rule groups, set unique priori-
                            ties for the stateless rules that you  define  in-
                            side any single StatelessRules object.

                            You can change the priority settings of your rules
                            at any time. To make it  easier  to  insert  rules
                            later,  number them so there's a wide range in be-
                            tween, for example use 100, 200, and so on.

                 CustomActions -> (list)
                     Defines an array of individual custom action  definitions
                     that are available for use by the stateless rules in this
                     StatelessRulesAndCustomActions  specification.  You  name
                     each  custom action that you define, and then you can use
                     it by name in your  StatelessRule    RuleDefinition   Ac-
                     tions specification.

                     (structure)
                        An  optional, non-standard action to use for stateless
                        packet handling. You can define this  in  addition  to
                        the standard action that you must specify.

                        You  define  and name the custom actions that you want
                        to be able to use, and then you reference them by name
                        in your actions settings.

                        You can use custom actions in the following places:

                        o In  a  rule  group's  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions
                          specification. The custom actions are available  for
                          use  by  name  inside the StatelessRulesAndCustomAc-
                          tions where you define them. You can  use  them  for
                          your  stateless  rule  actions to specify what to do
                          with a packet that  matches  the  rule's  match  at-
                          tributes.

                        o In a  FirewallPolicy specification, in StatelessCus-
                          tomActions . The custom actions  are  available  for
                          use inside the policy where you define them. You can
                          use them for the policy's default stateless  actions
                          settings  to  specify  what  to do with packets that
                          don't match any of the policy's stateless rules.

                        ActionName -> (string)
                            The descriptive name of  the  custom  action.  You
                            can't change the name of a custom action after you
                            create it.

                        ActionDefinition -> (structure)
                            The custom action associated with the action name.

                            PublishMetricAction -> (structure)
                               Stateless inspection  criteria  that  publishes
                               the  specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for
                               the matching packet.  This  setting  defines  a
                               CloudWatch dimension value to be published.

                               You can pair this custom action with any of the
                               standard stateless rule actions.  For  example,
                               you  could  pair this in a rule action with the
                               standard action that forwards  the  packet  for
                               stateful   inspection.   Then,  when  a  packet
                               matches the rule,  Network  Firewall  publishes
                               metrics for the packet and forwards it.

                               Dimensions -> (list)
                                   (structure)
                                      The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch
                                      custom metric dimension. This is used in
                                      the  PublishMetrics    CustomAction  . A
                                      CloudWatch custom metric dimension is  a
                                      name/value pair that's part of the iden-
                                      tity of a metric.

                                      Network Firewall sets the dimension name
                                      to  CustomAction and you provide the di-
                                      mension value.

                                      For more  information  about  CloudWatch
                                      custom metric dimensions, see Publishing
                                      Custom Metrics in the Amazon  CloudWatch
                                      User Guide .

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          The  value to use in the custom met-
                                          ric dimension.

          StatefulRuleOptions -> (structure)
              Additional options governing how Network Firewall handles state-
              ful  rules.  The policies where you use your stateful rule group
              must have stateful rule options  settings  that  are  compatible
              with these settings.

              RuleOrder -> (string)
                 Indicates  how to manage the order of the rule evaluation for
                 the rule group. DEFAULT_ACTION_ORDER is the default behavior.
                 Stateful  rules  are  provided to the rule engine as Suricata
                 compatible strings, and Suricata evaluates them based on cer-
                 tain settings. For more information, see Evaluation order for
                 stateful rules in the Network Firewall Developer Guide .

       --rules (string)
          A string containing stateful  rule  group  rules  specifications  in
          Suricata  flat  format,  with  one rule per line. Use this to import
          your existing Suricata compatible rule groups.

          NOTE:
              You must provide either this rules setting or a populated  Rule-
              Group setting, but not both.

          You  can provide your rule group specification in Suricata flat for-
          mat through this setting when you create or update your rule  group.
          The  call response returns a  RuleGroup object that Network Firewall
          has populated from your string.

       --type (string)
          Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or  stateful.  If  the
          rule  group  is  stateless,  it  contains  stateless rules. If it is
          stateful, it contains stateful rules.

          Possible values:

          o STATELESS

          o STATEFUL

       --description (string)
          A description of the rule group.

       --capacity (integer)
          The maximum operating resources that this rule group can  use.  Rule
          group  capacity  is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group,
          you are limited to this capacity. When you reference  a  rule  group
          from  a firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves this capacity for
          the rule group.

          You can retrieve the capacity that would  be  required  for  a  rule
          group  before  you create the rule group by calling  CreateRuleGroup
          with DryRun set to TRUE .

          NOTE:
                 You can't change or exceed this capacity when you update  the
                 rule group, so leave room for your rule group to grow.

              Capacity for a stateless rule group

          For  a stateless rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the
          capacity requirements of the individual rules  that  you  expect  to
          have in the rule group.

          To calculate the capacity requirement of a single rule, multiply the
          capacity requirement values of each of the rule's match settings:

          o A match setting with no criteria specified has a value of 1.

          o A match setting with Any specified has a value of 1.

          o All other match settings have a value equal to the number of  ele-
            ments  provided  in  the  setting. For example, a protocol setting
            ["UDP"] and a source setting ["10.0.0.0/24"] each have a value  of
            1.  A  protocol  setting  ["UDP","TCP"] has a value of 2. A source
            setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"] has a value of
            3.

          A rule with no criteria specified in any of its match settings has a
          capacity  requirement  of  1.   A   rule   with   protocol   setting
          ["UDP","TCP"],                     source                    setting
          ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"], and a single specifica-
          tion  or no specification for each of the other match settings has a
          capacity requirement of 6.
              Capacity for a stateful rule group

          For a stateful rule group, the minimum capacity required is the num-
          ber of individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group.

       --tags (list)
          The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

          (structure)
              A  key:value  pair  associated  with  an Amazon Web Services re-
              source. The key:value pair can be  anything  you  define.  Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment")
              and the tag value represents a specific value within that  cate-
              gory  (such  as "test," "development," or "production"). You can
              add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The part of the key:value pair that defines a  tag.  You  can
                 use  a tag key to describe a category of information, such as
                 "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 The part of the key:value pair that defines a  tag.  You  can
                 use  a  tag value to describe a specific value within a cate-
                 gory, such  as  "companyA"  or  "companyB."  Tag  values  are
                 case-sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the valid-
          ity of the request, rather than run the request.

          If set to TRUE , Network Firewall checks whether the request can run
          successfully,  but  doesn't actually make the requested changes. The
          call returns the value that the request would return if you  ran  it
          with dry run set to FALSE , but doesn't make additions or changes to
          your resources. This option allows you to make sure  that  you  have
          the  required  permissions  to run the request and that your request
          parameters are valid.

          If set to FALSE , Network Firewall makes the  requested  changes  to
          your resources.

       --encryption-configuration (structure)
          A  complex  type  that contains settings for encryption of your rule
          group resources.

          KeyId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service  (KMS)
              customer  managed  key.  You  can use any of the key identifiers
              that KMS supports, unless you're using a key that's  managed  by
              another  account.  If  you're using a key managed by another ac-
              count, then specify the key ARN. For more information,  see  Key
              ID in the Amazon Web Services KMS Developer Guide .

          Type -> (string)
              The type of Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption of
              your Network Firewall resources.

            "Type": "CUSTOMER_KMS"|"AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY"
          }

       --source-metadata (structure)
          A complex type that contains metadata about the rule group that your
          own  rule  group  is  copied  from. You can use the metadata to keep
          track of updates made to the originating rule group.

          SourceArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group that  your  own
              rule group is copied from.

          SourceUpdateToken -> (string)
              The  update  token of the Amazon Web Services managed rule group
              that your own rule group is copied from. To determine the update
              token for the managed rule group, call DescribeRuleGroup .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SourceArn=string,SourceUpdateToken=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SourceArn": "string",

          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       UpdateToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a  to-
          ken to your requests that access the rule group. The token marks the
          state of the rule group resource at the time of the request.

          To make changes to the rule group, you provide the token in your re-
          quest. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the rule group
          hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has  changed,  the
          operation fails with an InvalidTokenException . If this happens, re-
          trieve the rule group again to get a current copy of it with a  cur-
          rent  token.  Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation
          again using the new token.

       RuleGroupResponse -> (structure)
          The high-level properties of a rule  group.  This,  along  with  the
          RuleGroup  , define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects for
          a rule group by calling  DescribeRuleGroup .

          RuleGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

              NOTE:
                 If this response is for a create request that had DryRun  set
                 to  TRUE , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't attached
                 to a valid resource.

          RuleGroupName -> (string)
              The descriptive name of the rule group.  You  can't  change  the
              name of a rule group after you create it.

          RuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the rule group.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the rule group.

          Type -> (string)
              Indicates  whether  the  rule group is stateless or stateful. If
              the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If  it
              is stateful, it contains stateful rules.

          Capacity -> (integer)
              The  maximum  operating  resources that this rule group can use.
              Rule group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule
              group,  you  are  limited to this capacity. When you reference a
              rule group from a firewall  policy,  Network  Firewall  reserves
              this capacity for the rule group.

              You  can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule
              group before you create the rule group by  calling   CreateRule-
              Group with DryRun set to TRUE .

          RuleGroupStatus -> (string)
              Detailed information about the current status of a rule group.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

              (structure)
                 A  key:value  pair associated with an Amazon Web Services re-
                 source. The key:value pair can be anything you define.  Typi-
                 cally,  the  tag key represents a category (such as "environ-
                 ment") and the tag value represents a specific  value  within
                 that  category  (such  as  "test," "development," or "produc-
                 tion"). You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services
                 resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag key to describe a category of  information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
                     category,  such  as  "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values
                     are case-sensitive.

          ConsumedCapacity -> (integer)
              The number of capacity units  currently  consumed  by  the  rule
              group rules.

          NumberOfAssociations -> (integer)
              The number of firewall policies that use this rule group.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains the Amazon Web Services KMS encryp-
              tion configuration settings for your rule group.

              KeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon  Web  Services  Key  Management  Service
                 (KMS)  customer managed key. You can use any of the key iden-
                 tifiers that KMS supports, unless you're using a  key  that's
                 managed  by another account. If you're using a key managed by
                 another account, then specify the key ARN. For more  informa-
                 tion,  see  Key  ID  in the Amazon Web Services KMS Developer
                 Guide .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption
                 of your Network Firewall resources.

          SourceMetadata -> (structure)
              A  complex type that contains metadata about the rule group that
              your own rule group is copied from. You can use the metadata  to
              track the version updates made to the originating rule group.

              SourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the rule group that your
                 own rule group is copied from.

              SourceUpdateToken -> (string)
                 The update token of the  Amazon  Web  Services  managed  rule
                 group  that  your own rule group is copied from. To determine
                 the  update  token  for  the   managed   rule   group,   call
                 DescribeRuleGroup .

          SnsTopic -> (string)
              The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notification
              Service SNS topic that's used to record changes to  the  managed
              rule  group. You can subscribe to the SNS topic to receive noti-
              fications when the managed rule group is modified, such  as  for
              new  versions  and for version expiration. For more information,
              see the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide. .
