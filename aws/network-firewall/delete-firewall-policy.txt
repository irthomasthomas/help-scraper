DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-firewall-policy
          [--firewall-policy-name <value>]
          [--firewall-policy-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-policy-name (string)
          The  descriptive  name  of the firewall policy. You can't change the
          name of a firewall policy after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FirewallPolicyResponse -> (structure)
          The  object containing the definition of the  FirewallPolicyResponse
          that you asked to delete.

          FirewallPolicyName -> (string)
              The descriptive name of the firewall policy.  You  can't  change
              the name of a firewall policy after you create it.

          FirewallPolicyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

              NOTE:
                 If  this response is for a create request that had DryRun set
                 to TRUE , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't  attached
                 to a valid resource.

          FirewallPolicyId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the firewall policy.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the firewall policy.

          FirewallPolicyStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the firewall policy. You can retrieve this
              for a firewall policy  by  calling   DescribeFirewallPolicy  and
              providing the firewall policy's name or ARN.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

              (structure)
                 A  key:value  pair associated with an Amazon Web Services re-
                 source. The key:value pair can be anything you define.  Typi-
                 cally,  the  tag key represents a category (such as "environ-
                 ment") and the tag value represents a specific  value  within
                 that  category  (such  as  "test," "development," or "produc-
                 tion"). You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services
                 resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag key to describe a category of  information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  part  of  the key:value pair that defines a tag. You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
                     category,  such  as  "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values
                     are case-sensitive.

          ConsumedStatelessRuleCapacity -> (integer)
              The number of capacity units currently consumed by the  policy's
              stateless rules.

          ConsumedStatefulRuleCapacity -> (integer)
              The  number of capacity units currently consumed by the policy's
              stateful rules.

          NumberOfAssociations -> (integer)
              The number of firewalls that are associated with  this  firewall
              policy.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains the Amazon Web Services KMS encryp-
              tion configuration settings for your firewall policy.

              KeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon  Web  Services  Key  Management  Service
                 (KMS)  customer managed key. You can use any of the key iden-
                 tifiers that KMS supports, unless you're using a  key  that's
                 managed  by another account. If you're using a key managed by
                 another account, then specify the key ARN. For more  informa-
                 tion,  see  Key  ID  in the Amazon Web Services KMS Developer
                 Guide .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption
                 of your Network Firewall resources.
