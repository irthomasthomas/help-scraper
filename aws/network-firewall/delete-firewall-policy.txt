OPTIONS
       --firewall-policy-name (string)
          The  descriptive  name  of the firewall policy. You can't change the
          name of a firewall policy after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FirewallPolicyResponse -> (structure)
          The object containing the definition of the   FirewallPolicyResponse
          that you asked to delete.

          FirewallPolicyName -> (string)
              The  descriptive  name  of the firewall policy. You can't change
              the name of a firewall policy after you create it.

          FirewallPolicyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

              NOTE:
                 If this response is for a create request that had DryRun  set
                 to  TRUE , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't attached
                 to a valid resource.

          FirewallPolicyId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the firewall policy.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the firewall policy.

          FirewallPolicyStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the firewall policy. You can retrieve this
              for  a  firewall  policy  by calling  DescribeFirewallPolicy and
              providing the firewall policy's name or ARN.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

              (structure)
                 A key:value pair associated with an Amazon Web  Services  re-
                 source.  The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typi-
                 cally, the tag key represents a category (such  as  "environ-
                 ment")  and  the tag value represents a specific value within
                 that category (such as  "test,"  "development,"  or  "produc-
                 tion"). You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services
                 resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The part of the key:value pair that defines  a  tag.  You
                     can  use a tag key to describe a category of information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The part of the key:value pair that defines  a  tag.  You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
                     category, such as "companyA" or  "companyB."  Tag  values
                     are case-sensitive.

          ConsumedStatelessRuleCapacity -> (integer)
              The  number of capacity units currently consumed by the policy's
              stateless rules.

          ConsumedStatefulRuleCapacity -> (integer)
              The number of capacity units currently consumed by the  policy's
              stateful rules.

          NumberOfAssociations -> (integer)
              The  number  of firewalls that are associated with this firewall
              policy.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains the Amazon Web Services KMS encryp-
              tion configuration settings for your firewall policy.

              KeyId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the  Amazon  Web Services Key Management Service
                 (KMS) customer managed key. You can use any of the key  iden-
                 tifiers  that  KMS supports, unless you're using a key that's
                 managed by another account. If you're using a key managed  by
                 another  account, then specify the key ARN. For more informa-
                 tion, see Key ID in the Amazon  Web  Services  KMS  Developer
                 Guide .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption
                 of your Network Firewall resources.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time that the firewall policy was changed.
