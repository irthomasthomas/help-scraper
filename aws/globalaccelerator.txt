DESCRIPTION
       This is the Global Accelerator API Reference . This guide is for devel-
       opers who need detailed information about Global  Accelerator  API  ac-
       tions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accel-
       erator features, see the Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

       Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to im-
       prove  the performance of your applications for local and global users.
       Depending on the type of accelerator you choose,  you  can  gain  addi-
       tional benefits.

       o By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your
         internet applications that are used by  a  global  audience.  With  a
         standard  accelerator,  Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal
         endpoints over the Amazon Web Services global network.

       o For other scenarios, you might choose a custom  routing  accelerator.
         With  a  custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to
         directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many end-
         points.

       WARNING:
          Global  Accelerator  is  a global service that supports endpoints in
          multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you  must  specify  the  US
          West  (Oregon)  Region to create, update, or otherwise work with ac-
          celerators. That is, for example, specify --region us-west-2 on  AWS
          CLI commands.

       By  default,  Global  Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses
       that you associate with your accelerator. The static IP  addresses  are
       anycast from the Amazon Web Services edge network. For IPv4, Global Ac-
       celerator provides two static IPv4 addresses.  For  dual-stack,  Global
       Accelerator  provides  a  total  of four addresses: two static IPv4 ad-
       dresses and two static IPv6 addresses. With a standard accelerator  for
       IPv4,  instead of using the addresses that Global Accelerator provides,
       you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own
       IP address ranges that you bring toGlobal Accelerator (BYOIP).

       For  a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traf-
       fic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web  Services
       Regions  ,  which increases the availability of your applications. End-
       points for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers,  Appli-
       cation  Load  Balancers,  Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses
       that are located in one Amazon Web Services Region or  multiple  Amazon
       Web  Services Regions. For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic
       that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2  servers
       in endpoints that are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.

       WARNING:
          The  static  IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as
          long as it exists, even if you disable the  accelerator  and  it  no
          longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accel-
          erator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so
          you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM poli-
          cies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the
          users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more infor-
          mation, see Tag-based policies .

       For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the Amazon Web  Ser-
       vices  global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint
       based on health, client location, and policies that you configure.  The
       service  reacts  instantly to changes in health or configuration to en-
       sure that internet traffic from clients is always directed  to  healthy
       endpoints.
