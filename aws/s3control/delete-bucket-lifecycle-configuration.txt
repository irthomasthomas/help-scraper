NAME
       delete-bucket-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This action deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's lifecycle con-
          figuration. To delete an S3 bucket's  lifecycle  configuration,  see
          DeleteBucketLifecycle in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

       Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified Outposts bucket.
       Amazon S3 on Outposts removes all the lifecycle configuration rules  in
       the  lifecycle  subresource  associated  with  the bucket. Your objects
       never expire, and Amazon S3 on Outposts no longer automatically deletes
       any  objects  on  the basis of rules contained in the deleted lifecycle
       configuration. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in
       Amazon S3 User Guide .

       To  use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3-out-
       posts:PutLifecycleConfiguration action. By default,  the  bucket  owner
       has  this  permission and the Outposts bucket owner can grant this per-
       mission to others.

       All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require  an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request.
       In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts  endpoint  hostname  prefix
       instead of s3-control . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon
       S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts  endpoint  hostname  prefix
       and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the
       Examples section.

       For more information about object expiration, see Elements to  Describe
       Lifecycle Actions .

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID of the lifecycle configuration to delete.

       --bucket (string)
          Specifies the bucket.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and  CLI,  you must specify the ARN of the bucket ac-
          cessed in the format  arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:out-
          post/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>  .  For example, to access
          the bucket reports  through  Outpost  my-outpost  owned  by  account
          123456789012   in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding  of
          arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
          post/bucket/reports . The value must be URL encoded.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
