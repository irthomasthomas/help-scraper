NAME
       create-access-grant -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  access  grant that gives a grantee access to your S3 data.
       The grantee can be an IAM user or role or a directory user,  or  group.
       Before  you  can  create a grant, you must have an S3 Access Grants in-
       stance in the same Region as the S3 data. You can create an  S3  Access
       Grants  instance  using  the CreateAccessGrantsInstance . You must also
       have registered at least one S3 data location in your S3 Access  Grants
       instance using CreateAccessGrantsLocation .
          Permissions

       You  must  have  the s3:CreateAccessGrant permission to use this opera-
       tion.
          Additional Permissions

       For any directory identity - sso:DescribeInstance  and  sso:DescribeAp-
       plication

       For directory users - identitystore:DescribeUser

       For directory groups - identitystore:DescribeGroup

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services account that is making this re-
          quest.

       --access-grants-location-id (string)
          The ID of the registered location to which you are granting  access.
          S3  Access Grants assigns this ID when you register the location. S3
          Access Grants assigns the ID default to the default  location  s3://
          and  assigns an auto-generated ID to other locations that you regis-
          ter.

          If you are passing the default location, you cannot create an access
          grant  for  the  entire  default  location.  You must also specify a
          bucket or a bucket and prefix in the Subprefix field.

       --access-grants-location-configuration (structure)
          The configuration options of the grant location. The grant  location
          is the S3 path to the data to which you are granting access. It con-
          tains the S3SubPrefix field. The grant scope is the  result  of  ap-
          pending  the subprefix to the location scope of the registered loca-
          tion.

          S3SubPrefix -> (string)
              The S3SubPrefix is appended to the location scope  creating  the
              grant  scope. Use this field to narrow the scope of the grant to
              a subset of the location scope. This field is  required  if  the
              location  scope is the default location s3:// because you cannot
              create a grant for all of your S3 data in the  Region  and  must
              narrow  the scope. For example, if the location scope is the de-
              fault location s3:// , the S3SubPrefx can be a <bucket-name>/
              *
              , so the full grant scope path would be  s3://<bucket-name>/*  .
              Or  the  S3SubPrefx can be <bucket-name>/<prefix-name>* , so the
              full grant  scope  path  would  be  or  s3://<bucket-name>/<pre-
              fix-name>* .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 107)
                     Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

                     If the S3SubPrefix includes a prefix, append the wildcard
                     character * after the prefix to indicate that you want to
                     include  all  object  key  names in the bucket that start
                     with that prefix.

          {
            "S3SubPrefix": "string"
          }

       --grantee (structure)
          The user, group, or role to which you are granting access.  You  can
          grant  access  to an IAM user or role. If you have added your corpo-
          rate directory to Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Center and  asso-
          ciated  your Identity Center instance with your S3 Access Grants in-
          stance, the grantee can also be a corporate directory user or group.

          GranteeType -> (string)
              The type of the grantee to which access has been granted. It can
              be one of the following values:

              o IAM - An IAM user or role.

              o DIRECTORY_USER  -  Your  corporate directory user. You can use
                this option if you have added your corporate  identity  direc-
                tory  to  IAM  Identity Center and associated the IAM Identity
                Center instance with your S3 Access Grants instance.

              o DIRECTORY_GROUP - Your corporate directory group. You can  use
                this  option  if you have added your corporate identity direc-
                tory to IAM Identity Center and associated  the  IAM  Identity
                Center instance with your S3 Access Grants instance.

          GranteeIdentifier -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  of the Grantee . If the grantee type is
              IAM , the identifier is the IAM Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of
              the  user  or  role.  If the grantee type is a directory user or
              group, the identifier is 128-bit universally  unique  identifier
              (UUID)  in the format a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 . You
              can obtain this UUID from your Amazon Web Services IAM  Identity
              Center instance.

          stance. If an application ARN is included in the request  to  create
          an  access  grant,  the  grantee can only access the S3 data through
          this application.

       --s3-prefix-type (string)
          The type of S3SubPrefix . The only possible value is Object  .  Pass
          this  value if the access grant scope is an object. Do not pass this
          value if the access grant scope is a bucket or a bucket and  a  pre-
          fix.

          Possible values:

          o Object

       --tags (list)
          The Amazon Web Services resource tags that you are adding to the ac-

              location  scope is the default location s3:// because you cannot
              create a grant for all of your S3 data in the  Region  and  must
              narrow  the scope. For example, if the location scope is the de-
              fault location s3:// , the S3SubPrefx can be a <bucket-name>/
              *
              , so the full grant scope path would be  s3://<bucket-name>/*  .
              Or  the  S3SubPrefx can be <bucket-name>/<prefix-name>* , so the
              full grant  scope  path  would  be  or  s3://<bucket-name>/<pre-
              fix-name>* .

          only access the S3 data through this application.

       GrantScope -> (string)
          The S3 path of the data to which you are granting access. It is  the
          result of appending the Subprefix to the location scope.
