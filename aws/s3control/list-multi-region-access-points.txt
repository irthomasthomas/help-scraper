DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Returns  a  list of the Multi-Region Access Points currently associated
       with the specified Amazon Web Services account. Each call can return up
       to  100  Multi-Region Access Points, the maximum number of Multi-Region
       Access Points that can be associated with a single account.

       This action will always be routed to the US West (Oregon)  Region.  For
       more  information  about the restrictions around working with Multi-Re-
       gion Access Points, see Multi-Region Access Point restrictions and lim-
       itations in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --next-token (string)
          Not currently used. Do not use this parameter.

       --max-results (integer)
          Not currently used. Do not use this parameter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

OUTPUT
       AccessPoints -> (list)
          The list of Multi-Region Access Points associated with the user.

          (structure)
              A collection of statuses for a Multi-Region Access Point in  the
              various Regions it supports.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the Multi-Region Access Point.

              Alias -> (string)
                 The  alias for the Multi-Region Access Point. For more infor-
                 mation about the distinction between the name and  the  alias
                 of  an Multi-Region Access Point, see Rules for naming Amazon
                 S3 Multi-Region Access Points .

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 When the Multi-Region Access Point  create  request  was  re-
                 ceived.

              PublicAccessBlock -> (structure)
                 The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to apply to
                 this Amazon S3 account. You can enable the configuration  op-
                 tions  in  any  combination.  For more information about when
                 Amazon S3 considers a bucket or object public, see The  Mean-
                 ing of "Public" in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 This data type is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  Amazon  S3 should block public access
                     control lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting
                     this element to TRUE causes the following behavior:

                     o PutBucketAcl  and PutObjectAcl calls fail if the speci-
                       fied ACL is public.

                     o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a  public
                       ACL.

                     o PUT  Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public
                       ACL.

                     Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or
                     ACLs.

                     This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for
                     buckets in this account. Setting  this  element  to  TRUE
                     causes  Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in
                     this account and any objects that they contain.

                     Enabling this setting doesn't affect the  persistence  of
                     any  existing  ACLs  and  doesn't prevent new public ACLs
                     from being set.

                     This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should  block  public  bucket
                     policies  for  buckets in this account. Setting this ele-
                     ment to TRUE causes Amazon S3  to  reject  calls  to  PUT
                     Bucket  policy if the specified bucket policy allows pub-
                     lic access.

                     Enabling this  setting  doesn't  affect  existing  bucket
                     policies.

                     This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket
                     policies for buckets in this account. Setting  this  ele-
                     ment  to  TRUE  restricts  access  to buckets with public
                     policies to only Amazon Web Services  service  principals
                     and authorized users within this account.

                     Enabling  this  setting  doesn't affect previously stored
                     bucket policies, except that public and cross-account ac-
                     cess  within any public bucket policy, including non-pub-
                     lic delegation to specific accounts, is blocked.

                     This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the Multi-Region Access Point.
                     CREATING and DELETING are  temporary  states  that  exist
                     while  the request is propagating and being completed. If
                     a  Multi-Region  Access  Point  has  a  status  of   PAR-
                     TIALLY_CREATED , you can retry creation or send a request
                     to delete the Multi-Region Access Point. If  a  Multi-Re-
                     gion Access Point has a status of PARTIALLY_DELETED , you
                     can retry a delete request to finish the deletion of  the
                     Multi-Region Access Point.

              Regions -> (list)
                 A  collection  of the Regions and buckets associated with the
                 Multi-Region Access Point.

                 (structure)
                     A combination of a bucket and Region  that's  part  of  a
                     Multi-Region Access Point.

                     Bucket -> (string)
                        The name of the bucket.

                     Region -> (string)
                        The name of the Region.

                     BucketAccountId -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Web Services account ID that owns the Ama-
                        zon S3 bucket that's associated with this Multi-Region
                        Access Point.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the specified bucket has more Multi-Region Access Points than can
          be returned in one call to this action, this field contains  a  con-
          tinuation token. You can use this token tin subsequent calls to this
          action to retrieve additional Multi-Region Access Points.
