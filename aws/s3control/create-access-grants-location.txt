DESCRIPTION
       The  S3 data location that you would like to register in your S3 Access
       Grants instance. Your S3 data must be in the same Region as your S3 Ac-
       cess Grants instance. The location can be one of the following:

       o The default S3 location s3://

       o A bucket - S3://<bucket-name>

       o A bucket and prefix - S3://<bucket-name>/<prefix>

       When  you  register  a location, you must include the IAM role that has
       permission to manage the S3 location that you are registering. Give  S3
       Access Grants permission to assume this role using a policy . S3 Access

       temporary credentials to grantees or client applications.

       operation.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services account that is making this re-
          quest.

       --location-scope (string)
          The S3 path to the location that you are registering.  The  location
          scope can be the default S3 location s3:// , the S3 path to a bucket
          s3://<bucket>  ,  or  the  S3  path   to   a   bucket   and   prefix
          s3://<bucket>/<prefix> . A prefix in S3 is a string of characters at
          the beginning of an object key name used  to  organize  the  objects
          that  you  store  in  your S3 buckets. For example, object key names

          start with the marketing/campaigns/ prefix.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM role for the registered

       --tags (list)
          The  Amazon Web Services resource tags that you are adding to the S3
          Access Grants location. Each tag is a label consisting of a user-de-
          fined  key  and value. Tags can help you manage, identify, organize,
          search for, and filter resources.

          (structure)
              An Amazon Web Services resource tag that's associated with  your

              NOTE:
                 This operation is only supported for S3 Storage  Lens  groups
                 and  for  S3 Access Grants . The tagged resource can be an S3
                 Storage Lens group or S3 Access Grants  instance,  registered
                 location, or grant.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  of the key-value pair of a tag added to your Amazon
                 Web Services resource. A tag key can be  up  to  128  Unicode
                 characters  in  length  and is case-sensitive. System created

                 The value of the key-value pair of a tag added to your Amazon
                 Web  Services  resource. A tag value can be up to 256 Unicode
                 characters in length and is case-sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
