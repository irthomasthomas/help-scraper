OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the S3 Access Grants instance.

       --access-grants-location-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the registered location that you are deregistering from
          your S3 Access Grants instance. S3 Access Grants  assigned  this  ID
          when  you  registered  the location. S3 Access Grants assigns the ID
          default to the default location s3:// and assigns an  auto-generated
          ID to other locations that you register.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
