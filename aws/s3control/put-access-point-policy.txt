PUT-ACCESS-POINT-POLICY()                            PUT-ACCESS-POINT-POLICY()



NAME
       put-access-point-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Associates  an  access policy with the specified access point. Each ac-
       cess point can have only one policy, so a request made to this API  re-
       places any existing policy associated with the specified access point.

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request.
       In  addition,  you  must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix
       instead of s3-control . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon
       S3  on  Outposts  that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix
       and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the
       Examples section.

       The following actions are related to PutAccessPointPolicy :

       o GetAccessPointPolicy

       o DeleteAccessPointPolicy

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web Services account ID for owner of the bucket associ-
          ated with the specified access point.

       --name (string)
          The name of the access point that you want  to  associate  with  the
          specified policy.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the access point
          accessed    in    the    format    arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<ac-
          count-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/accesspoint/<my-accesspoint-name>   .
          For example, to access the access point reports-ap  through  Outpost
          my-outpost  owned  by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2 , use
          the URL encoding of  arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:out-
          post/my-outpost/accesspoint/reports-ap  .  The value must be URL en-
          coded.

       --policy (string)
          The policy that you want to apply to the specified access point. For
          more  information about access point policies, see Managing data ac-
          cess with Amazon S3 access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set an access point policy

       The following put-access-point-policy example places the specified  ac-
       cess   point   policy  for  the  access  point  finance-ap  in  account
       123456789012. If the access point finance-ap already has a policy, this
       command  replaces  the  existing  policy with the one specified in this
       command. Before running this example, replace the account  number,  ac-
       cess point name, and policy statements with appropriate values for your
       use case.

          aws s3control put-access-point-policy \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --name finance-ap \
              --policy file://ap-policy.json

       Contents of ap-policy.json:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Principal": {
                          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
                      },
                      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/finance-ap/object/Alice/*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       This command produces no output.

       Points in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
