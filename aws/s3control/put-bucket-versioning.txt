PUT-BUCKET-VERSIONING()                                PUT-BUCKET-VERSIONING()



NAME
       put-bucket-versioning -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  operation sets the versioning state for S3 on Outposts buckets
          only.  To  set  the  versioning  state  for  an   S3   bucket,   see
          PutBucketVersioning in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

       Sets  the  versioning  state for an S3 on Outposts bucket. With S3 Ver-
       sioning, you can save multiple distinct copies of your objects and  re-
       cover from unintended user actions and application failures.

       You can set the versioning state to one of the following:

       o Enabled  -  Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All ob-
         jects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

       o Suspended - Suspends versioning for the objects in  the  bucket.  All
         objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null .

       If  you've  never  set  versioning on your bucket, it has no versioning
       state. In that case, a GetBucketVersioning request does  not  return  a
       versioning state value.

       When you enable S3 Versioning, for each object in your bucket, you have
       a current version and zero or more noncurrent versions. You can config-
       ure  your bucket S3 Lifecycle rules to expire noncurrent versions after
       a specified time period. For more information, see Creating and  manag-
       ing  a  lifecycle  configuration  for your S3 on Outposts bucket in the
       Amazon S3 User Guide .

       If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned
       bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when
       you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The
       noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletions of the
       noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. For more  in-
       formation, see Versioning in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request.
       In  addition,  you  must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix
       instead of s3-control . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon
       S3  on  Outposts  that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix
       and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the
       Examples section.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the S3 on Outposts bucket.

       --bucket (string)
          The S3 on Outposts bucket to set the versioning state for.

       --mfa (string)
          The concatenation of the authentication device's  serial  number,  a
          space,  and  the  value that is displayed on your authentication de-
          vice.

       --versioning-configuration (structure)
          The root-level tag for the VersioningConfiguration parameters.

          MFADelete -> (string)
              Specifies whether MFA delete  is  enabled  or  disabled  in  the
              bucket versioning configuration for the S3 on Outposts bucket.

          Status -> (string)
              Sets the versioning state of the S3 on Outposts bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MFADelete=string,Status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MFADelete": "Enabled"|"Disabled",
            "Status": "Enabled"|"Suspended"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
