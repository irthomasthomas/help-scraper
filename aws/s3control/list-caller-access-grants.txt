LIST-CALLER-ACCESS-GRANTS()                        LIST-CALLER-ACCESS-GRANTS()



NAME
       list-caller-access-grants -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the access grants that were given to the caller using
       S3 Access Grants and that allow the caller to access the S3 data of the
       Amazon Web Services account specified in the request.
          Permissions

       You  must have the s3:ListCallerAccessGrants permission to use this op-
       eration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-caller-access-grants is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: CallerAccessGrantsList

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the S3 Access Grants instance.

       --grant-scope (string)
          The  S3  path  of the data that you would like to access. Must start
          with s3:// . You can optionally pass only the  beginning  characters
          of  a  path,  and  S3  Access  Grants will search for all applicable
          grants for the path fragment.

       --allowed-by-application | --no-allowed-by-application (boolean)
          If this optional parameter is passed in the request, a filter is ap-
          plied  to  the  results.  The  results  will include only the access
          grants for the caller's Identity Center application or for any other
          applications (ALL ).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A  pagination token that you can use to request the next page of re-
          sults. Pass this value into a subsequent List Caller  Access  Grants
          request in order to retrieve the next page of results.

       CallerAccessGrantsList -> (list)
          A  list of the caller's access grants that were created using S3 Ac-
          cess Grants and that grant the caller access to the S3 data  of  the
          Amazon Web Services account ID that was specified in the request.

          (structure)
              Part  of  ListCallerAccessGrantsResult . Each entry includes the
              permission level (READ, WRITE, or READWRITE) and the grant scope
              of  the  access grant. If the grant also includes an application
              ARN, the grantee can only access the S3 data through this appli-
              cation.

              Permission -> (string)
                 The  type of permission granted, which can be one of the fol-
                 lowing values:

                 o READ - Grants read-only access to the S3 data.

                 o WRITE - Grants write-only access to the S3 data.

                 o READWRITE - Grants both read and write  access  to  the  S3
                   data.

              GrantScope -> (string)
                 The  S3  path  of the data to which you have been granted ac-
                 cess.

              ApplicationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services  IAM
                 Identity  Center  application  associated  with your Identity
                 Center instance. If the grant includes  an  application  ARN,
                 the grantee can only access the S3 data through this applica-
                 tion.
