NAME
       put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  action  puts a lifecycle configuration to an Amazon S3 on Out-
          posts bucket. To put a lifecycle configuration to an S3 bucket,  see
          PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

       Creates  a new lifecycle configuration for the S3 on Outposts bucket or
       replaces an existing lifecycle  configuration.  Outposts  buckets  only
       support  lifecycle  configurations  that  delete/expire objects after a
       certain period of time and abort incomplete multipart uploads.

       All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require  an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request.
       In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts  endpoint  hostname  prefix
       instead of s3-control . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon
       S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts  endpoint  hostname  prefix
       and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the
       Examples section.

       The following actions are related to PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration :

       o GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration

       o DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to set the configuration.

          Rules -> (list)
              A lifecycle rule for individual objects in an Outposts bucket.

              (structure)

                 Expiration -> (structure)
                     Specifies the expiration for the lifecycle of the  object
                     in  the  form of date, days and, whether the object has a
                     delete marker.

                     Date -> (timestamp)
                        Indicates at what date the object is  to  be  deleted.

                        the  delete  marker  will be expired. If set to false,
                        the policy takes no action. This cannot  be  specified
                        with Days or Date in a Lifecycle Expiration Policy.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Unique  identifier  for  the  rule.  The  value cannot be

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
