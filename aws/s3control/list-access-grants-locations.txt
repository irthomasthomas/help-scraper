OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services account that is making this re-
          quest.

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token to request the next page of  results.  Pass  this
          value  into a subsequent List Access Grants Locations request in or-
          der to retrieve the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of access grants that you would like returned  in
          the  List Access Grants response. If the results include the pagina-
          tion token NextToken , make another call using the NextToken to  de-
          termine if there are more results.

       --location-scope (string)
          The  S3  path to the location that you are registering. The location
          scope can be the default S3 location s3:// , the S3 path to a bucket
          s3://<bucket>   ,   or   the   S3   path  to  a  bucket  and  prefix
          s3://<bucket>/<prefix> . A prefix in S3 is a string of characters at
          the  beginning  of  an  object key name used to organize the objects
          that you store in your S3 buckets. For  example,  object  key  names
          that  start  with  the  engineering/ prefix or object key names that
          start with the marketing/campaigns/ prefix.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A  pagination  token  to request the next page of results. Pass this
          value into a subsequent List Access Grants Locations request in  or-
          der to retrieve the next page of results.

       AccessGrantsLocationsList -> (list)
          A  container  for  a  list  of  registered locations in an S3 Access
          Grants instance.

          (structure)

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when you registered the location.

              AccessGrantsLocationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the registered location to which you  are  granting
                 access.  S3  Access  Grants assigns this ID when you register
                 the location. S3 Access Grants assigns the ID default to  the
                 default  location  s3://  and assigns an auto-generated ID to
                 other locations that you register.

              AccessGrantsLocationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the registered location.

              LocationScope -> (string)
                 The S3 path to the location that you are registering. The lo-
                 cation  scope  can  be the default S3 location s3:// , the S3
                 path to a bucket s3://<bucket> , or the S3 path to  a  bucket
                 and  prefix  s3://<bucket>/<prefix>  .  A  prefix  in S3 is a
                 string of characters at the beginning of an object  key  name
                 used  to organize the objects that you store in your S3 buck-
                 ets. For example, object key names that start with the  engi-
                 neering/  prefix or object key names that start with the mar-
                 keting/campaigns/ prefix.

              IAMRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for the regis-
                 tered  location. S3 Access Grants assumes this role to manage
                 access to the registered location.
