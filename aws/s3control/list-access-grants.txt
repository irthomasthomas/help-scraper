OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the S3 Access Grants instance.

       --next-token (string)
          A  pagination  token  to request the next page of results. Pass this
          value into a subsequent List Access Grants request in order  to  re-
          trieve the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of access grants that you would like returned in
          the List Access Grants response. If the results include the  pagina-
          tion  token NextToken , make another call using the NextToken to de-
          termine if there are more results.

       --grantee-type (string)
          The type of the grantee to which access has been granted. It can  be
          one of the following values:

          o IAM - An IAM user or role.

          o DIRECTORY_USER  -  Your corporate directory user. You can use this
            option if you have added your corporate identity directory to  IAM
            Identity  Center  and  associated the IAM Identity Center instance
            with your S3 Access Grants instance.

          o DIRECTORY_GROUP - Your corporate directory group. You can use this
            option  if you have added your corporate identity directory to IAM
            Identity Center and associated the IAM  Identity  Center  instance
            with your S3 Access Grants instance.

          Possible values:

          o DIRECTORY_USER

          o DIRECTORY_GROUP

          o IAM

       --grantee-identifier (string)
          The  unique  identifer of the Grantee . If the grantee type is IAM ,
          the identifier is the IAM Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user  or
          role.  If the grantee type is a directory user or group, the identi-
          fier is 128-bit universally unique identifier (UUID) in  the  format
          a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 . You can obtain this UUID from
          your Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Center instance.

       --permission (string)
          The type of permission granted to your S3 data, which can be set  to
          one of the following values:

          o READ  Grant read-only access to the S3 data.

          o WRITE  Grant write-only access to the S3 data.

          o READWRITE  Grant both read and write access to the S3 data.

          Possible values:

          o READ

          o WRITE

          o READWRITE

       --grant-scope (string)
          The  S3 path of the data to which you are granting access. It is the
          result of appending the Subprefix to the location scope.

       --application-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services  IAM  Iden-
          tity  Center  application  associated  with your Identity Center in-
          stance. If the grant includes an application ARN,  the  grantee  can
          only access the S3 data through this application.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the access grant.

              Grantee -> (structure)
                 The user, group, or role to which you  are  granting  access.
                 You  can  grant  access  to  an IAM user or role. If you have
                 added your corporate directory to  Amazon  Web  Services  IAM
                 Identity  Center and associated your Identity Center instance
                 with your S3 Access Grants instance, the grantee can also  be
                 a corporate directory user or group.

                 GranteeType -> (string)
                     The type of the grantee to which access has been granted.
                     It can be one of the following values:

                     o IAM - An IAM user or role.

                     o DIRECTORY_USER - Your corporate directory user. You can
                       use  this option if you have added your corporate iden-
                       tity directory to IAM Identity  Center  and  associated
                       the  IAM  Identity  Center instance with your S3 Access
                       Grants instance.

                     o DIRECTORY_GROUP - Your corporate directory  group.  You
                       can  use  this  option if you have added your corporate
                       identity directory to IAM Identity Center  and  associ-
                       ated  the IAM Identity Center instance with your S3 Ac-
                       cess Grants instance.

                 GranteeIdentifier -> (string)
                     The unique identifier of the Grantee  .  If  the  grantee
                     type  is  IAM , the identifier is the IAM Amazon Resource
                     Name (ARN) of the user or role. If the grantee type is  a
                     directory  user  or group, the identifier is 128-bit uni-
                     versally  unique  identifier   (UUID)   in   the   format
                     a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111  .  You  can  obtain
                     this UUID from your Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Cen-
                     ter instance.

              Permission -> (string)
                 The  type of access granted to your S3 data, which can be set
                 to one of the following values:

                 o READ  Grant read-only access to the S3 data.

                 o WRITE  Grant write-only access to the S3 data.

                 o READWRITE  Grant both read and write access to the S3 data.

              AccessGrantsLocationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the registered location to which you  are  granting
                 access.  S3  Access  Grants assigns this ID when you register
                 the location. S3 Access Grants assigns the ID default to  the
                 default  location  s3://  and assigns an auto-generated ID to
                 other locations that you register.

              AccessGrantsLocationConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration options of the grant  location.  The  grant
                 location is the S3 path to the data to which you are granting
                 access.

                 S3SubPrefix -> (string)
                     The S3SubPrefix is appended to the location scope  creat-
                     ing  the  grant scope. Use this field to narrow the scope
                     of the grant to a subset  of  the  location  scope.  This
                     field  is  required  if the location scope is the default
                     location s3:// because you cannot create a grant for  all
                     of  your S3 data in the Region and must narrow the scope.
                     For example, if the location scope is the  default  loca-
                     tion s3:// , the S3SubPrefx can be a <bucket-name>/
                     *
                     ,    so    the   full   grant   scope   path   would   be
                     s3://<bucket-name>/*  .  Or   the   S3SubPrefx   can   be
                     <bucket-name>/<prefix-name>*  ,  so  the full grant scope
                     path would be or s3://<bucket-name>/<prefix-name>* .

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 402)
                            Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

                            If the S3SubPrefix includes a prefix,  append  the
                            wildcard  character * after the prefix to indicate
                            that you want to include all object key  names  in
                            the bucket that start with that prefix.

              GrantScope -> (string)
                 The  S3 path of the data to which you are granting access. It
                 is the result of appending  the  Subprefix  to  the  location
                 scope.

              ApplicationArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services IAM
                 Identity Center application  associated  with  your  Identity
                 Center  instance.  If  the grant includes an application ARN,
                 the grantee can only access the S3 data through this applica-
                 tion.
