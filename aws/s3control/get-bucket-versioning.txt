GET-BUCKET-VERSIONING()                                GET-BUCKET-VERSIONING()



NAME
       get-bucket-versioning -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  operation returns the versioning state only for S3 on Outposts
          buckets. To return the  versioning  state  for  an  S3  bucket,  see
          GetBucketVersioning in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

       Returns  the  versioning  state for an S3 on Outposts bucket. With ver-
       sioning, you can save multiple distinct copies of your data and recover
       from unintended user actions and application failures.

       If  you've  never  set  versioning on your bucket, it has no versioning
       state. In that case, the GetBucketVersioning request does not return  a
       versioning state value.

       For  more information about versioning, see Versioning in the Amazon S3
       User Guide .

       All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require  an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request.
       In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts  endpoint  hostname  prefix
       instead of s3-control . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon
       S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts  endpoint  hostname  prefix
       and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the
       Examples section.

       The following operations are related to GetBucketVersioning for  S3  on
       Outposts.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the S3 on Outposts bucket.

       --bucket (string)
          The S3 on Outposts bucket to return the versioning state for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          The versioning state of the S3 on Outposts bucket.

       MFADelete -> (string)
          Specifies whether MFA delete is enabled  in  the  bucket  versioning
          configuration.  This element is returned only if the bucket has been
          configured with MFA delete. If MFA delete has never been  configured
          for the bucket, this element is not returned.
