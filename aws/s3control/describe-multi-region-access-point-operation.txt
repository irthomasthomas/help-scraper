OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --request-token-arn (string)
          The  request  token  associated  with  the  request you want to know
          about. This request token is returned as part of the  response  when
          you  make  an  asynchronous request. You provide this token to query
          about the status of the asynchronous action.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AsyncOperation -> (structure)

          ation.

              The time that the request was sent to the service.

          Operation -> (string)
              The specific operation for the asynchronous request.

          RequestTokenARN -> (string)
              The request token associated with the request.

          RequestParameters -> (structure)
              The parameters associated with the request.

                 CreateMultiRegionAccessPoint request.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the Multi-Region Access Point associated with
                     this request.

                 PublicAccessBlock -> (structure)
                     The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to  ap-
                     ply to this Amazon S3 account. You can enable the config-
                     uration options in any combination. For more  information
                     about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or object public,
                     see The Meaning of "Public" in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                     BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access
                        control lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Set-
                        ting this element to TRUE causes the following  behav-
                        ior:

                        o PUT  Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the
                          specified ACL is public.

                        o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a pub-
                          lic ACL.

                        o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a pub-
                          lic ACL.

                        Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies
                        or ACLs.

                        This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                     IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
                        Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs
                        for buckets in this account. Setting this  element  to
                        TRUE  causes  Amazon  S3  to ignore all public ACLs on
                        buckets in this account and any objects that they con-
                        tain.

                        Enabling  this  setting doesn't affect the persistence
                        of any existing ACLs and doesn't  prevent  new  public
                        ACLs from being set.

                        This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                     BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket
                        policies for buckets in this account. Setting this el-
                        ement  to TRUE causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT
                        Bucket policy if the specified  bucket  policy  allows
                        public access.

                        Enabling  this  setting doesn't affect existing bucket
                        policies.

                        This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                     RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether Amazon  S3  should  restrict  public
                        bucket  policies  for buckets in this account. Setting
                        this element to TRUE restricts access to buckets  with
                        public  policies to only Amazon Web Service principals
                        and authorized users within this account.

                        Enabling this setting doesn't affect previously stored
                        bucket  policies, except that public and cross-account
                        access within  any  public  bucket  policy,  including
                        non-public   delegation   to   specific  accounts,  is
                        blocked.

                        This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
