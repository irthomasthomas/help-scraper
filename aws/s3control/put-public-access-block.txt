OPTIONS
       --public-access-block-configuration (structure)
          The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to  apply  to  the
          specified Amazon Web Services account.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should block public access control
              lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting  this  element
              to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PutBucketAcl  and PutObjectAcl calls fail if the specified ACL
                is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for  buck-
              ets  in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes Amazon
              S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and  any
              objects that they contain.

              Enabling  this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any ex-
              isting ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket  policies
              for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes
              Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the  specified
              bucket policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket poli-
              cies for buckets in this account. Setting this element  to  TRUE
              restricts  access to buckets with public policies to only Amazon
              Web Servicesservice principals and authorized users within  this
              account.

              Enabling  this  setting  doesn't affect previously stored bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public  bucket  policy,  including non-public delegation to spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BlockPublicAcls=boolean,IgnorePublicAcls=boolean,BlockPublicPolicy=boolean,RestrictPublicBuckets=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BlockPublicAcls": true|false,
            "IgnorePublicAcls": true|false,
            "BlockPublicPolicy": true|false,
            "RestrictPublicBuckets": true|false
          }

       --account-id (string)
          The account ID for the Amazon Web Services account  whose  PublicAc-
          cessBlock configuration you want to set.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
