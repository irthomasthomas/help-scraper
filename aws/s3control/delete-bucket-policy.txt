DELETE-BUCKET-POLICY()                                  DELETE-BUCKET-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-bucket-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  action  deletes  an  Amazon  S3  on Outposts bucket policy. To
          delete an S3 bucket policy, see DeleteBucketPolicy in the Amazon  S3
          API Reference .

       This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to
       delete the policy of a specified Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket.  If  you
       are  using  an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have  the
       s3-outposts:DeleteBucketPolicy  permissions  on  the specified Outposts
       bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account to use this action. For
       more  information,  see  Using  Amazon S3 on Outposts in Amazon S3 User
       Guide .

       If you don't have DeleteBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3  returns  a
       403  Access  Denied  error.  If  you  have the correct permissions, but
       you're not using an identity that belongs to  the  bucket  owner's  ac-
       count, Amazon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

       WARNING:
          As  a  security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services
          account that owns a bucket can always use this action, even  if  the
          policy  explicitly  denies the root user the ability to perform this
          action.

       For more information about bucket policies, see Using  Bucket  Policies
       and User Policies .

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request.
       In  addition,  you  must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix
       instead of s3-control . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon
       S3  on  Outposts  that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix
       and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the
       Examples section.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID of the Outposts bucket.

       --bucket (string)
          Specifies the bucket.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and  CLI,  you must specify the ARN of the bucket ac-
          cessed in the format  arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:out-
          post/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>  .  For example, to access
          the bucket reports  through  outpost  my-outpost  owned  by  account
          123456789012   in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding  of
          arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
          post/bucket/reports . The value must be URL encoded.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.
