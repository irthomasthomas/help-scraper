NAME
       list-access-points-for-object-lambda -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Returns some or all (up to 1,000) access points associated with the Ob-
       ject Lambda Access Point per call. If there are more access points than
       what can be returned in one call, the response will include a continua-
       tion token that you can use to list the additional access points.

       The following actions are related to ListAccessPointsForObjectLambda :

       o CreateAccessPointForObjectLambda

       o DeleteAccessPointForObjectLambda

       o GetAccessPointForObjectLambda

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-access-points-for-object-lambda is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: ObjectLambdaAccessPointList

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID for the account that owns the specified Object Lambda
          Access Point.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ObjectLambdaAccessPointList -> (list)
          Returns list of Object Lambda Access Points.

          (structure)
              An access point with an attached Lambda function used to  access
              transformed data from an Amazon S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the Object Lambda Access Point.

              ObjectLambdaAccessPointArn -> (string)
                 Specifies the ARN for the Object Lambda Access Point.

              Alias -> (structure)
                 The alias of the Object Lambda Access Point.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The alias value of the Object Lambda Access Point.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The  status  of  the Object Lambda Access Point alias. If
                     the status is PROVISIONING ,  the  Object  Lambda  Access
                     Point  is  provisioning  the  alias  and the alias is not
                     ready for use yet. If the status is READY  ,  the  Object
                     Lambda Access Point alias is successfully provisioned and
                     ready for use.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the list has more access points than can be returned in one  call
          to  this  API, this field contains a continuation token that you can
          provide in subsequent calls to this API to retrieve  additional  ac-
          cess points.
