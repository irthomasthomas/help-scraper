DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Creates  a  Multi-Region Access Point and associates it with the speci-
       fied buckets. For more information about creating  Multi-Region  Access
       Points,  see  Creating Multi-Region Access Points in the Amazon S3 User
       Guide .

       This action will always be routed to the US West (Oregon)  Region.  For
       more  information  about  the restrictions around managing Multi-Region
       Access Points, see Managing Multi-Region Access Points in the Amazon S3
       User Guide .

       This request is asynchronous, meaning that you might receive a response
       before the command has completed. When  this  request  provides  a  re-
       sponse,  it  provides a token that you can use to monitor the status of
       the request with DescribeMultiRegionAccessPointOperation .

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access  Point.  The owner of the Multi-Region Access Point also must
          own the underlying buckets.

       --client-token (string)
          An idempotency token used to identify the request and guarantee that
          requests are unique.

       --details (structure)
          A container element containing details about the Multi-Region Access
          Point.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the Multi-Region Access Point associated  with  this
              request.

          PublicAccessBlock -> (structure)
              The  PublicAccessBlock  configuration  that you want to apply to
              this Amazon S3 account. You can enable the configuration options
              in  any  combination.  For more information about when Amazon S3
              considers a bucket or object public, see The Meaning of "Public"
              in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              This data type is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should block public access con-
                 trol lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account.  Setting  this
                 element to TRUE causes the following behavior:

                 o PutBucketAcl  and  PutObjectAcl calls fail if the specified
                   ACL is public.

                 o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

                 o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

                 Enabling this setting doesn't  affect  existing  policies  or
                 ACLs.

                 This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  Amazon  S3  should ignore public ACLs for
                 buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE  causes
                 Amazon  S3  to  ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this ac-
                 count and any objects that they contain.

                 Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence  of  any
                 existing  ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being
                 set.

                 This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket  poli-
                 cies  for  buckets  in  this account. Setting this element to
                 TRUE causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if
                 the specified bucket policy allows public access.

                 Enabling  this  setting  doesn't affect existing bucket poli-
                 cies.

                 This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether Amazon S3  should  restrict  public  bucket
                 policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to
                 TRUE restricts access to buckets with public policies to only
                 Amazon  Web  Service  principals  and authorized users within
                 this account.

                 Enabling this setting doesn't affect previously stored bucket
                 policies,  except that public and cross-account access within
                 any public bucket policy, including non-public delegation  to
                 specific accounts, is blocked.

                 This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          Regions -> (list)
              The  buckets  in  different Regions that are associated with the
              Multi-Region Access Point.

              (structure)
                 A Region that supports a Multi-Region Access Point as well as
                 the associated bucket for the Region.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The name of the associated bucket for the Region.

                 BucketAccountId -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Web Services account ID that owns the Amazon
                     S3 bucket that's associated with this Multi-Region Access
                     Point.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,PublicAccessBlock={BlockPublicAcls=boolean,IgnorePublicAcls=boolean,BlockPublicPolicy=boolean,RestrictPublicBuckets=boolean},Regions=[{Bucket=string,BucketAccountId=string},{Bucket=string,BucketAccountId=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "PublicAccessBlock": {
              "BlockPublicAcls": true|false,
              "IgnorePublicAcls": true|false,
              "BlockPublicPolicy": true|false,
              "RestrictPublicBuckets": true|false
            },
            "Regions": [
              {
                "Bucket": "string",
                "BucketAccountId": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       RequestTokenARN -> (string)
          The request token associated with the request. You can use this  to-
          ken  with  DescribeMultiRegionAccessPointOperation  to determine the
