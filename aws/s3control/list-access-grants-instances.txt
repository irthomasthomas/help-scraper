NAME
       list-access-grants-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of S3 Access Grants instances. An S3 Access Grants in-
       stance serves as a logical grouping for your individual access  grants.
       You can only have one S3 Access Grants instance per Region per account.
          Permissions

       You  must  have the s3:ListAccessGrantsInstances permission to use this
       operation.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the S3 Access Grants instance.

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token to request the next page of  results.  Pass  this
          value  into a subsequent List Access Grants Instances request in or-
          der to retrieve the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of access grants that you would like returned  in
          the  List Access Grants response. If the results include the pagina-
          tion token NextToken , make another call using the NextToken to  de-
          termine if there are more results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token to request the next page of  results.  Pass  this
          value  into a subsequent List Access Grants Instances request in or-
          der to retrieve the next page of results.

       AccessGrantsInstancesList -> (list)
          A container for a list of S3 Access Grants instances.

          (structure)
              Information about the S3 Access Grants instance.

              AccessGrantsInstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the S3 Access Grants instance. The ID is default  .
                 You can have one S3 Access Grants instance per Region per ac-
                 count.

              AccessGrantsInstanceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3  Access  Grants  in-
                 stance.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time when you created the S3 Access Grants in-
                 stance.

              IdentityCenterArn -> (string)
                 If you associated your S3 Access Grants instance with an Ama-
                 zon Web Services IAM Identity Center instance, this field re-
                 turns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM Identity Cen-
                 ter instance application; a subresource of the original Iden-
                 tity Center instance. S3 Access Grants creates this  Identity
                 Center  application  for  the  specific  S3 Access Grants in-
                 stance.

              IdentityCenterInstanceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services IAM
                 Identity  Center  instance that you are associating with your
                 S3 Access Grants instance. An IAM Identity Center instance is
                 your  corporate  identity directory that you added to the IAM
                 Identity Center. You can use the ListInstances API  operation
                 to  retrieve  a  list  of  your Identity Center instances and
                 their ARNs.

              IdentityCenterApplicationArn -> (string)
                 If you associated your S3 Access Grants instance with an Ama-
                 zon Web Services IAM Identity Center instance, this field re-
                 turns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM Identity Cen-
                 ter instance application; a subresource of the original Iden-
                 tity Center instance. S3 Access Grants creates this  Identity
                 Center  application  for  the  specific  S3 Access Grants in-
                 stance.
