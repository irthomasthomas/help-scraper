SUBMIT-MULTI-REGION-ACCESS-POINT-ROUTSUBMIT-MULTI-REGION-ACCESS-POINT-ROUTES()



NAME
       submit-multi-region-access-point-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Submits an updated route configuration for a Multi-Region Access Point.
       This API operation updates the routing status for the specified Regions
       from  active  to passive, or from passive to active. A value of 0 indi-
       cates a passive status, which means that traffic won't be routed to the
       specified  Region.  A  value  of  100 indicates an active status, which
       means that traffic will be routed to the specified Region. At least one
       Region must be active at all times.

       When  the  routing configuration is changed, any in-progress operations
       (uploads, copies, deletes, and so on) to formerly active  Regions  will
       continue  to  run to their final completion state (success or failure).
       The routing configurations of any Regions that arent  specified  remain
       unchanged.

       NOTE:
          Updated  routing configurations might not be immediately applied. It
          can take up to 2 minutes for your changes to take effect.

       To submit routing control changes and failover requests, use the Amazon
       S3  failover  control infrastructure endpoints in these five Amazon Web
       Services Regions:

       o us-east-1

       o us-west-2

       o ap-southeast-2

       o ap-northeast-1

       o eu-west-1

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --mrap (string)
          The Multi-Region Access Point ARN.

       --route-updates (list)
          The  different  routes that make up the new route configuration. Ac-
          tive routes return a value of 100 ,  and  passive  routes  return  a
          value of 0 .

          (structure)
              A structure for a Multi-Region Access Point that indicates where
              Amazon S3 traffic can be routed. Routes can be either active  or
              passive.  Active  routes  can process Amazon S3 requests through
              the Multi-Region Access Point, but passive routes are not eligi-
              ble to process Amazon S3 requests.

              Each route contains the Amazon S3 bucket name and the Amazon Web
              Services Region that the bucket is located in.  The  route  also
              includes  the  TrafficDialPercentage  value, which shows whether
              the bucket and Region are active (indicated by a value of 100  )
              or passive (indicated by a value of 0 ).

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the Amazon S3 bucket for which you'll submit a
                 routing configuration change. Either the Bucket or the Region
                 value must be provided. If both are provided, the bucket must
                 be in the specified Region.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region to which you'll be  submitting
                 a  routing configuration change. Either the Bucket or the Re-
                 gion value must be provided. If both are provided, the bucket
                 must be in the specified Region.

              TrafficDialPercentage -> (integer)
                 The traffic state for the specified bucket or Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Region.

                 A value of 0 indicates a passive state, which means  that  no
                 new traffic will be routed to the Region.

                 A  value  of  100 indicates an active state, which means that
                 traffic will be routed to the specified Region.

                 When the routing configuration for a Region is  changed  from
                 active  to  passive,  any  in-progress  operations  (uploads,
                 copies, deletes, and so on) to  the  formerly  active  Region
                 will continue to run to until a final success or failure sta-
                 tus is reached.

                 If all Regions in the routing configuration are designated as
                 passive, you'll receive an InvalidRequest error.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bucket=string,Region=string,TrafficDialPercentage=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Region": "string",
              "TrafficDialPercentage": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update your Multi-Region Access Point routing configuration

       The following submit-multi-region-access-point-routes  example  updates
       the  routing  statuses of DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-1 and DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-2
       in the ap-southeast-2 Region for your Multi-Region Access Point.

          aws s3control submit-multi-region-access-point-routes \
              --region ap-southeast-2 \
              --account-id 111122223333 \
              --mrap MultiRegionAccessPoint_ARN \
              --route-updates Bucket=DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-1,TrafficDialPercentage=100 Bucket=DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-2,TrafficDialPercentage=0

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
