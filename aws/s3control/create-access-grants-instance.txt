       Region per account.
          Permissions

       You  must have the s3:CreateAccessGrantsInstance permission to use this
       operation.
          Additional Permissions

       To associate an IAM Identity Center instance with your S3 Access Grants
       instance,  you  must also have the sso:DescribeInstance , sso:CreateAp-
       plication , sso:PutApplicationGrant , and sso:PutApplicationAuthentica-

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services account that is making this re-
          quest.

       --identity-center-arn (string)
          If you would like to associate your S3 Access Grants  instance  with
          an  Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Center instance, use this field
          to pass the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Amazon  Web  Services
          IAM  Identity  Center instance that you are associating with your S3
          Access Grants instance. An IAM Identity Center instance is your cor-
          porate identity directory that you added to the IAM Identity Center.
          You can use the ListInstances API operation to retrieve  a  list  of
          your Identity Center instances and their ARNs.

       --tags (list)
          The  Amazon Web Services resource tags that you are adding to the S3
          Access Grants instance. Each tag is a label consisting of a user-de-
          fined  key  and value. Tags can help you manage, identify, organize,
          search for, and filter resources.

          (structure)
              An Amazon Web Services resource tag that's associated with  your
              S3  resource.  You  can  add tags to new objects when you upload
              them, or you can add object tags to existing objects.

              NOTE:
                 This operation is only supported for S3 Storage  Lens  groups
                 and  for  S3 Access Grants . The tagged resource can be an S3
                 Storage Lens group or S3 Access Grants  instance,  registered
                 location, or grant.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  of the key-value pair of a tag added to your Amazon
                 Web Services resource. A tag key can be  up  to  128  Unicode
                 characters  in  length  and is case-sensitive. System created
                 tags that begin with aws: arent supported.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the key-value pair of a tag added to your Amazon
                 Web  Services  resource. A tag value can be up to 256 Unicode
                 characters in length and is case-sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when you created the S3 Access Grants instance.

       AccessGrantsInstanceId -> (string)
          The ID of the S3 Access Grants instance. The ID is default . You can
          have one S3 Access Grants instance per Region per account.

       AccessGrantsInstanceArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 Access Grants instance.

       IdentityCenterArn -> (string)
          If you associated your S3 Access Grants instance with an Amazon  Web
          Services IAM Identity Center instance, this field returns the Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM Identity Center instance application;
          a subresource of the original Identity Center instance passed in the
          request. S3 Access Grants creates this Identity  Center  application
          for this specific S3 Access Grants instance.
