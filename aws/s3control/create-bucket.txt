DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This action creates an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To create an S3
          bucket, see Create Bucket in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

       Creates a new Outposts bucket. By creating the bucket, you  become  the
       bucket  owner.  To  create an Outposts bucket, you must have S3 on Out-
       posts. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in  Amazon
       S3 User Guide .

       Not  every  string  is  an  acceptable  bucket name. For information on
       bucket naming restrictions, see Working with Amazon S3 Buckets .

       S3 on Outposts buckets support:

       o Tags

       o LifecycleConfigurations for deleting expired objects

       For a complete list of restrictions and Amazon S3  feature  limitations

       tions .

       For an example of the request syntax for Amazon  S3  on  Outposts  that
       uses  the  S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and x-amz-outpost-id
       in your API request, see the Examples section.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON

       the string will be taken literally.

          The location of the bucket.

       BucketArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and  CLI,  you must specify the ARN of the bucket ac-
          cessed in the format  arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:out-
          post/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>  .  For example, to access
          the bucket reports  through  Outpost  my-outpost  owned  by  account
          123456789012   in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding  of
          arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
          post/bucket/reports . The value must be URL encoded.
