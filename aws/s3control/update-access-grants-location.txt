OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)

       --access-grants-location-id (string)
          The  ID  of the registered location that you are updating. S3 Access
          Grants assigns this ID when you register  the  location.  S3  Access
          Grants  assigns the ID default to the default location s3:// and as-
          signs an auto-generated ID to other locations that you register.

          The ID of the registered location to which you are granting  access.
          S3  Access Grants assigned this ID when you registered the location.
          S3 Access Grants assigns the ID  default  to  the  default  location
          s3://  and  assigns an auto-generated ID to other locations that you
          register.

          If you are passing the default location, you cannot create an access
          grant  for  the  entire  default  location.  You must also specify a
          bucket or a bucket and prefix in the Subprefix field.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role  for  the  registered

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
