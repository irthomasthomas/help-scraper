PUT-BUCKET-TAGGING()                                      PUT-BUCKET-TAGGING()



NAME
       put-bucket-tagging -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  action  puts  tags  on an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To put
          tags on an S3 bucket, see PutBucketTagging in the Amazon S3 API Ref-
          erence .

       Sets  the  tags for an S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information, see
       Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your  own
       cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services ac-
       count bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of  com-
       bined  resources,  organize  your  billing information according to re-
       sources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag  several
       resources  with  a  specific  application  name, and then organize your
       billing information to see the total cost of  that  application  across
       several services. For more information, see Cost allocation and tagging
       .

       NOTE:
          Within a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an exist-
          ing  tag,  the new value overwrites the old value. For more informa-
          tion, see Using cost allocation in Amazon S3 bucket tags .

       To use this action, you must have permissions to  perform  the  s3-out-
       posts:PutBucketTagging  action. The Outposts bucket owner has this per-
       mission by default and can grant this permission to  others.  For  more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing access permissions to your Amazon S3 re-
       sources .
          PutBucketTagging has the following special errors:

       o Error code: InvalidTagError

         o Description:  The  tag provided was not a valid tag. This error can
           occur if the tag did not pass  input  validation.  For  information
           about  tag  restrictions,  see  User-Defined  Tag  Restrictions and
           Amazon Web Services-Generated Cost Allocation Tag Restrictions .

       o Error code: MalformedXMLError

         o Description: The XML provided does not match the schema.

       o Error code: OperationAbortedError

         o Description: A  conflicting  conditional  action  is  currently  in
           progress against this resource. Try again.

       o Error code: InternalError

         o Description:  The  service  was unable to apply the provided tag to
           the bucket.

       All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require  an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request.
       In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts  endpoint  hostname  prefix
       instead of s3-control . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon
       S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts  endpoint  hostname  prefix
       and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the
       Examples section.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

       --bucket (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.

          For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts  with  the  REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For  using  this  parameter  with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
          Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN  of  the  bucket  ac-
          cessed  in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:out-
          post/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name> . For example,  to  access
          the  bucket  reports  through  outpost  my-outpost  owned by account
          123456789012  in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding   of
          arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
          post/bucket/reports . The value must be URL encoded.

       --tagging (structure)
          TagSet -> (list)
              A collection for a set of tags.

              (structure)
                 Key -> (string)

                 Value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagSet=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TagSet": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
