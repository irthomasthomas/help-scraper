NAME
       list-regional-buckets -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Returns  a list of all Outposts buckets in an Outpost that are owned by
       the authenticated sender of the  request.  For  more  information,  see
       Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       For  an  example  of  the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that
       uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix  and  x-amz-outpost-id
       in your request, see the Examples section.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

       --next-token (string)

       --max-results (integer)

       --outpost-id (string)
          The ID of the Outposts resource.

          NOTE:
              This ID is required by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RegionalBucketList -> (list)
          (structure)
              The container for the regional bucket.

              Bucket -> (string)

              BucketArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the regional bucket.

              PublicAccessBlockEnabled -> (boolean)

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date of the regional bucket

              OutpostId -> (string)
                 The Outposts ID of the regional bucket.

       NextToken -> (string)
          NextToken  is  sent  when isTruncated is true, which means there are
          more buckets that can be listed. The next list requests to Amazon S3
          can  be  continued with this NextToken . NextToken is obfuscated and
          is not a real key.
