CREATE-ACCESS-POINT()                                    CREATE-ACCESS-POINT()



NAME
       create-access-point -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  access  point and associates it with the specified bucket.
       For more information, see Managing Data Access with  Amazon  S3  Access
       Points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
          S3 on Outposts only supports VPC-style access points.

          For more information, see Accessing Amazon S3 on Outposts using vir-
          tual private cloud (VPC) only access points in the  Amazon  S3  User
          Guide .

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request.
       In  addition,  you  must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix
       instead of s3-control . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon
       S3  on  Outposts  that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix
       and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the
       Examples section.

       The following actions are related to CreateAccessPoint :

       o GetAccessPoint

       o DeleteAccessPoint

       o ListAccessPoints

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  account ID for the account that owns the
          specified access point.

       --name (string)
          The name you want to assign to this access point.

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket that you want to associate this access  point
          with.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and  CLI,  you must specify the ARN of the bucket ac-
          cessed in the format  arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:out-
          post/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>  .  For example, to access
          the bucket reports  through  Outpost  my-outpost  owned  by  account
          123456789012   in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding  of
          arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
          post/bucket/reports . The value must be URL encoded.

       --vpc-configuration (structure)
          If you include this field, Amazon S3 restricts access to this access
          point to requests from the specified virtual private cloud (VPC).

          NOTE:
              This is required for creating an access point for Amazon  S3  on
              Outposts buckets.

          VpcId -> (string)
              If  this  field  is specified, this access point will only allow
              connections from the specified VPC ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VpcId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VpcId": "string"
          }

       --public-access-block-configuration (structure)
          The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to  apply  to  the
          access point.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should block public access control
              lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting  this  element
              to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PutBucketAcl  and PutObjectAcl calls fail if the specified ACL
                is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for  buck-
              ets  in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes Amazon
              S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and  any
              objects that they contain.

              Enabling  this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any ex-
              isting ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket  policies
              for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes
              Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the  specified
              bucket policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket poli-
              cies for buckets in this account. Setting this element  to  TRUE
              restricts  access to buckets with public policies to only Amazon
              Web Service principals and authorized users within this account.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect  previously  stored  bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public bucket policy, including non-public  delegation  to  spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BlockPublicAcls=boolean,IgnorePublicAcls=boolean,BlockPublicPolicy=boolean,RestrictPublicBuckets=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BlockPublicAcls": true|false,
            "IgnorePublicAcls": true|false,
            "BlockPublicPolicy": true|false,
            "RestrictPublicBuckets": true|false
          }

       --bucket-account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the S3 bucket as-
          sociated with this access point.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an access point

       The following create-access-point example creates an access point named
       finance-ap for the bucket business-records in account 123456789012. Be-
       fore running this example, replace the access point name, bucket  name,
       and account number with appropriate values for your use case.

          aws s3control create-access-point \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --bucket business-records \
              --name finance-ap

       This command produces no output.
