DESCRIPTION
       This  operation allows you to list all the Amazon Web Services resource
       tags for a specified resource. Each tag is  a  label  consisting  of  a

          group or S3 Access Grants instance, registered location, or grant.

       For  more  information  about  the required Storage Lens Groups permis-
       sions, see Setting account permissions to use S3 Storage Lens groups .

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the resource owner.

       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 resource that you want to
          list the tags for. The tagged resource can be  an  S3  Storage  Lens
          group or S3 Access Grants instance, registered location, or grant.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 and for S3 Access Grants . The tagged resource can be  an  S3
                 Storage  Lens  group or S3 Access Grants instance, registered

                 The key of the key-value pair of a tag added to  your  Amazon
