CREATE-STORAGE-LENS-GROUP()                        CREATE-STORAGE-LENS-GROUP()



NAME
       create-storage-lens-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new S3 Storage Lens group and associates it with the speci-
       fied Amazon Web Services account ID. An S3 Storage Lens group is a cus-
       tom  grouping  of  objects based on prefix, suffix, object tags, object
       size, object age, or a combination of these filters. For  each  Storage
       Lens  group  that youve created, you can also optionally add Amazon Web
       Services resource tags. For more  information  about  S3  Storage  Lens
       groups, see Working with S3 Storage Lens groups .

       To  use  this  operation,  you  must have the permission to perform the
       s3:CreateStorageLensGroup action. If youre trying to create  a  Storage
       Lens  group  with Amazon Web Services resource tags, you must also have
       permission to perform the s3:TagResource action. For  more  information
       about the required Storage Lens Groups permissions, see Setting account
       permissions to use S3 Storage Lens groups .

       For information about Storage Lens groups errors, see List of Amazon S3
       Storage Lens error codes .

       --tags (list)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  resource tags that you're adding to your
          Storage Lens group. This parameter is optional.

          (structure)
              An Amazon Web Services resource tag that's associated with  your
              S3  resource.  You  can  add tags to new objects when you upload
              them, or you can add object tags to existing objects.

              NOTE:
                 This operation is only supported for S3 Storage  Lens  groups
                 and  for  S3 Access Grants . The tagged resource can be an S3

                 The  key  of the key-value pair of a tag added to your Amazon
                 Web Services resource. A tag key can be  up  to  128  Unicode
                 characters  in  length  and is case-sensitive. System created
                 tags that begin with aws: arent supported.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
