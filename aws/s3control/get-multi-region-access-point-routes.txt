NAME
       get-multi-region-access-point-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Returns  the routing configuration for a Multi-Region Access Point, in-
       dicating which Regions are active or passive.

       To obtain routing control changes and failover requests, use the Amazon
       S3  failover  control infrastructure endpoints in these five Amazon Web
       Services Regions:

       o us-east-1

       o us-west-2

       o ap-southeast-2

       o ap-northeast-1

       o eu-west-1

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --mrap (string)
          The Multi-Region Access Point ARN.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To query the current Multi-Region Access Point route configuration

       The following get-multi-region-access-point-routes example returns  the
       current  routing  configuration  for  the specified Multi-Region Access
       Point.

          aws s3control get-multi-region-access-point-routes \
              --region Region \
              --account-id 111122223333 \
              --mrap MultiRegionAccessPoint_ARN

       Output:

          {
              "Mrap": "arn:aws:s3::111122223333:accesspoint/0000000000000.mrap",
              "Routes": [
                  {
                      "Bucket": "DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-1",
                      "Region": "ap-southeast-2",
                      "TrafficDialPercentage": 100
                  },
                  {
                      "Bucket": "DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-2",
                      "Region": "us-west-1",
                      "TrafficDialPercentage": 0
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Mrap -> (string)
          The Multi-Region Access Point ARN.

       Routes -> (list)
          The different routes that make up the  route  configuration.  Active
          routes  return a value of 100 , and passive routes return a value of
          0 .

          (structure)
              A structure for a Multi-Region Access Point that indicates where
              Amazon  S3 traffic can be routed. Routes can be either active or
              passive. Active routes can process Amazon  S3  requests  through
              the Multi-Region Access Point, but passive routes are not eligi-
              ble to process Amazon S3 requests.

              Each route contains the Amazon S3 bucket name and the Amazon Web
              Services  Region  that  the bucket is located in. The route also
              includes the TrafficDialPercentage value,  which  shows  whether
              the  bucket and Region are active (indicated by a value of 100 )
              or passive (indicated by a value of 0 ).

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon S3 bucket for which  you'll  submit  a
                 routing configuration change. Either the Bucket or the Region
                 value must be provided. If both are provided, the bucket must
                 be in the specified Region.

              Region -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services Region to which you'll be submitting
                 a routing configuration change. Either the Bucket or the  Re-
                 gion value must be provided. If both are provided, the bucket
                 must be in the specified Region.

              TrafficDialPercentage -> (integer)
                 The traffic state for the specified bucket or Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Region.

                 A  value  of 0 indicates a passive state, which means that no
                 new traffic will be routed to the Region.

                 A value of 100 indicates an active state,  which  means  that
                 traffic will be routed to the specified Region.

                 When  the  routing configuration for a Region is changed from
                 active  to  passive,  any  in-progress  operations  (uploads,
                 copies,  deletes,  and  so  on) to the formerly active Region
                 will continue to run to until a final success or failure sta-
                 tus is reached.

                 If all Regions in the routing configuration are designated as
                 passive, you'll receive an InvalidRequest error.
