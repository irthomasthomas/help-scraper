OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  account  ID for the Amazon Web Services account whose PublicAc-
          cessBlock configuration you want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list public block access settings for an account

       The following get-public-access-block example displays the block public
       access settings for the specified account.

          aws s3control get-public-access-block \
              --account-id 123456789012

       Output:

          {
             "PublicAccessBlockConfiguration": {
                "BlockPublicPolicy": true,
                "RestrictPublicBuckets": true,
                "IgnorePublicAcls": true,
                "BlockPublicAcls": true
             }
          }

OUTPUT
       PublicAccessBlockConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  PublicAccessBlock  configuration  currently  in effect for this
          Amazon Web Services account.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public  access  control
              lists  (ACLs)  for buckets in this account. Setting this element
              to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PutBucketAcl and PutObjectAcl calls fail if the specified  ACL
                is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buck-
              ets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes  Amazon
              S3  to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and any
              objects that they contain.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any  ex-
              isting ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies
              for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes
              Amazon  S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified
              bucket policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket  poli-
              cies  for  buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE
              restricts access to buckets with public policies to only  Amazon
              Web Service principals and authorized users within this account.

              Enabling  this  setting  doesn't affect previously stored bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public  bucket  policy,  including non-public delegation to spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
