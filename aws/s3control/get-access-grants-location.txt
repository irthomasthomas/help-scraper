OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services account that is making this re-
          quest.

       --access-grants-location-id (string)
          The ID of the registered location that you are retrieving. S3 Access
          Grants  assigns  this  ID  when you register the location. S3 Access
          Grants assigns the ID default to the default location s3:// and  as-
          signs an auto-generated ID to other locations that you register.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

          The date and time when you registered the location.

       AccessGrantsLocationId -> (string)
          The ID of the registered location to which you are granting  access.
          S3  Access Grants assigns this ID when you register the location. S3
          Access Grants assigns the ID default to the default  location  s3://

          The S3 URI path to the registered location. The location  scope  can
          be  the  default S3 location s3:// , the S3 path to a bucket, or the
          S3 path to a bucket and prefix. A prefix in S3 is a string of  char-
          acters  at  the beginning of an object key name used to organize the
          objects that you store in your S3 buckets. For example,  object  key
          names  that  start  with the engineering/ prefix or object key names
          that start with the marketing/campaigns/ prefix.

       IAMRoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role  for  the  registered
          location. S3 Access Grants assumes this role to manage access to the
          registered location.
