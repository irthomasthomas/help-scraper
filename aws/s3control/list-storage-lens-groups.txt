OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  account  ID  that  owns the Storage Lens
          groups.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no  more
          results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

          available.  The  value of NextToken is a unique pagination token for
          each page. Make the call again using the returned token to  retrieve
