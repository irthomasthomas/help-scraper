OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the S3 Batch  Op-
          erations job.

       --job-id (string)
          The ID for the job whose information you want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                     Specifies the schema version for the payload  that  Batch
                     Operations  sends  when invoking an Lambda function. Ver-
                     sion 1.0 is the default. Version 2.0 is required when you
                     use  Batch Operations to invoke Lambda functions that act
                     on directory buckets, or if you need to specify UserArgu-
                     ments  .  For  more information, see Automate object pro-

                     erations  and  Lambda  in the Amazon Web Services Storage
                     Blog .

                     WARNING:
                        Ensure that your Lambda function code expects  Invoca-
                        tionSchemaVersion   2.0  and  uses  bucket name rather
                        than bucket ARN. If the  InvocationSchemaVersion  does
                        not  match  what  your  Lambda  function expects, your
                        function might not work as expected.

                     NOTE:

                 UserArguments -> (map)
                     Key-value pairs that are passed in the payload that Batch
                     Operations  sends  when  invoking an Lambda function. You
                     must specify InvocationSchemaVersion  2.0  for  LambdaIn-
                     voke operations that include UserArguments . For more in-
                     formation, see Automate object processing  in  Amazon  S3

                     specified,  the  tags of the source objects are copied to
                     destination objects by default.

                     NOTE:
                        Directory buckets - Tags aren't supported by directory

                     tiers  are  not  subject to restore expiry, so specifying
                     ExpirationInDays results in restore request failure.

                     S3 Batch Operations jobs can operate either on S3 Glacier
                     and  S3  Glacier Deep Archive storage class objects or on
                     S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access  and  Deep  Archive
                     Access  storage  tier  objects, but not both types in the
                     same job. If you need to restore objects  of  both  types
                     you must create separate Batch Operations jobs.
