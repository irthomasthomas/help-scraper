          --account-id <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the S3 Batch Op-
          erations job.

       --job-id (string)
          The ID for the job whose information you want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 RedirectLocation -> (string)
                     Specifies an optional metadata property for website redi-
                     rects, x-amz-website-redirect-location .  Allows  webpage

                     objects to be copied. For example, to copy objects into a
                     folder named Folder1 in the destination bucket,  set  the
                     TargetKeyPrefix to Folder1 .

                     for  object  encryption with server-side encryption using
                     Amazon Web Services KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting this header to
                     true  causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object
                     encryption with SSE-KMS.

                     Specifying this header with an object action  doesnt  af-
                     fect bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.

                     This  argument  specifies  how  long the S3 Glacier or S3
                     Glacier Deep Archive object remains available  in  Amazon
                     S3.  S3  Initiate  Restore  Object  jobs  that  target S3
                     Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive objects require Expi-
                     rationInDays set to 1 or greater.

                     Conversely,  do not set ExpirationInDays when creating S3
                     Initiate Restore Object  jobs  that  target  S3  Intelli-
                     gent-Tiering  Archive Access and Deep Archive Access tier
                     objects. Objects in S3 Intelligent-Tiering archive access
                     tiers  are  not  subject to restore expiry, so specifying
                     ExpirationInDays results in restore request failure.

                     S3 Batch Operations jobs can operate either on S3 Glacier
                     and  S3  Glacier Deep Archive storage class objects or on

                     Access  storage  tier  objects, but not both types in the
                     same job. If you need to restore objects  of  both  types
                     you must create separate Batch Operations jobs.
