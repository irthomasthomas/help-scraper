OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that is  making  this  re-
          quest.

       --target (string)
          The  S3  URI  path of the data to which you are requesting temporary
          access credentials. If the requesting account has  an  access  grant
          for  this  data, S3 Access Grants vends temporary access credentials
          in the response.

       --permission (string)
          The type of permission granted to your S3 data, which can be set  to
          one of the following values:

          o READ  Grant read-only access to the S3 data.

          o WRITE  Grant write-only access to the S3 data.

          o READWRITE  Grant both read and write access to the S3 data.

          Possible values:

          o READ

          o WRITE

          o READWRITE

       --duration-seconds (integer)
          The session duration, in seconds, of the temporary access credential
          that S3 Access Grants vends to the grantee  or  client  application.
          The  default  value  is  1 hour, but the grantee can specify a range
          from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to 43200 seconds (12 hours). If the
          grantee  requests  a  value  higher than this maximum, the operation
          fails.

       --privilege (string)
          The scope of the temporary access credential that S3  Access  Grants
          vends to the grantee or client application.

          o Default   The  scope of the returned temporary access token is the
            scope of the grant that is closest to the target scope.

          o Minimal  The scope of the returned temporary access token  is  the
            same  as the requested target scope as long as the requested scope
            is the same as or a subset of the grant scope.

          Possible values:

          o Minimal

          o Default

       --target-type (string)
          The type of Target . The only possible value is Object .  Pass  this
          value  if the target data that you would like to access is a path to
          an object. Do not pass this value if the target data is a bucket  or
          a bucket and a prefix.

          Possible values:

          o Object

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
