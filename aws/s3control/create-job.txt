OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID that creates the job.

       --confirmation-required | --no-confirmation-required (boolean)
          Indicates whether confirmation is required before Amazon S3 runs the
          job. Confirmation is only required for jobs created through the Ama-
          zon S3 console.

       --operation (structure)
          The action that you want this job to perform on every object  listed
          in  the  manifest. For more information about the available actions,
          see Operations in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          LambdaInvoke -> (structure)
              Directs the specified job to invoke an Lambda function on  every
              object in the manifest.

              FunctionArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for the Lambda function that
                 the specified job will invoke on every object  in  the  mani-
                 fest.

              InvocationSchemaVersion -> (string)
                 Specifies the schema version for the payload that Batch Oper-
                 ations sends when invoking an Lambda function. Version 1.0 is
                 the default. Version 2.0 is required when you use Batch Oper-
                 ations to invoke Lambda functions that act on directory buck-
                 ets,  or  if you need to specify UserArguments . For more in-
                 formation, see Automate object processing in Amazon S3 direc-
                 tory  buckets with S3 Batch Operations and Lambda in the Ama-
                 zon Web Services Storage Blog .

                 WARNING:
                     Ensure that your Lambda function code expects Invocation-
                     SchemaVersion   2.0  and  uses  bucket  name  rather than
                     bucket ARN. If the InvocationSchemaVersion does not match
                     what  your  Lambda  function expects, your function might
                     not work as expected.

                 NOTE:
                     Directory buckets  -  To  initiate  Amazon  Web  Services
                     Lambda  function  to perform custom actions on objects in
                     directory buckets, you must specify 2.0 .

              UserArguments -> (map)
                 Key-value pairs that are passed in the payload that Batch Op-
                 erations  sends  when  invoking  an Lambda function. You must
                 specify InvocationSchemaVersion  2.0 for LambdaInvoke  opera-
                 tions  that include UserArguments . For more information, see
                 Automate object processing in  Amazon  S3  directory  buckets

                        with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256 ) is sup-
                        ported.

              NewObjectTagging -> (list)
                 Specifies a list of tags to add to  the  destination  objects
                 after  they are copied. If NewObjectTagging is not specified,
                 the tags of the source objects are copied to destination  ob-
                 jects by default.

                 NOTE:
                     Directory  buckets  -  Tags aren't supported by directory
                     buckets. If your source objects have tags and your desti-
                     nation bucket is a directory bucket, specify an empty tag
                     set in the NewObjectTagging field to prevent copying  the
                     source object tags to the directory bucket.

                 (structure)
                     A container for a key-value name pair.

                     Key -> (string)
                        Key of the tag

                     Value -> (string)
                        Value of the tag

              RedirectLocation -> (string)
                 If  the destination bucket is configured as a website, speci-
                 fies an optional metadata  property  for  website  redirects,
                 x-amz-website-redirect-location . Allows webpage redirects if
                 the object copy is accessed through a website endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

              RequesterPays -> (boolean)

                 NOTE:
                     This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 Specify the storage class for the destination  objects  in  a
                 Copy operation.

                 NOTE:
                     Directory  buckets  - This functionality is not supported
                     by directory buckets.

              UnModifiedSinceConstraint -> (timestamp)

              SSEAwsKmsKeyId -> (string)

                 NOTE:

              TargetKeyPrefix -> (string)
                 Specifies the folder prefix that you want the objects  to  be
                 copied into. For example, to copy objects into a folder named
                 Folder1 in the destination bucket,  set  the  TargetKeyPrefix
                 property to Folder1 .

              ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus -> (string)
                 The  legal  hold  status  to be applied to all objects in the
                 Batch Operations job.

                 NOTE:
                     This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

                 The retention mode to be applied to all objects in the  Batch
                 Operations job.

                 NOTE:
                     This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

              ObjectLockRetainUntilDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date when the applied object retention configuration ex-
                 pires on all objects in the Batch Operations job.

                 NOTE:
                     This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

              BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket  Key  for
                 object  encryption  with  server-side encryption using Amazon
                 Web Services KMS  (SSE-KMS).  Setting  this  header  to  true
                 causes  Amazon  S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryp-
                 tion with SSE-KMS.

                 Specifying this header with an object  action  doesnt  affect
                 bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.

                 NOTE:
                     This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

                 ject integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          S3PutObjectAcl -> (structure)
              Directs  the  specified  job to run a PutObjectAcl call on every
              object in the manifest.

              NOTE:
                 This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

              AccessControlPolicy -> (structure)
                 AccessControlList -> (structure)
                     Owner -> (structure)
                        ID -> (string)

                        DisplayName -> (string)

                     Grants -> (list)
                        (structure)
                            Grantee -> (structure)
                               TypeIdentifier -> (string)

                               Identifier -> (string)

                            Permission -> (string)

                 CannedAccessControlList -> (string)

          S3PutObjectTagging -> (structure)
              Directs the specified job to run a PUT Object  tagging  call  on
              every object in the manifest.

              NOTE:
                 This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

              TagSet -> (list)
                 (structure)
                     A container for a key-value name pair.

                     Key -> (string)
                        Key of the tag

                     Value -> (string)
                        Value of the tag

          S3DeleteObjectTagging -> (structure)
              Directs  the  specified  job  to execute a DELETE Object tagging
              call on every object in the manifest.

              NOTE:
                 This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

          S3InitiateRestoreObject -> (structure)
              Directs the specified job to initiate restore requests for every
              archived object in the manifest.

              NOTE:
                 This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

              ExpirationInDays -> (integer)
                 This argument specifies how long the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier
                 Deep Archive object remains available in Amazon S3. S3 Initi-
                 ate Restore Object jobs that target S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier
                 Deep Archive objects require ExpirationInDays  set  to  1  or
                 greater.

                 Conversely, do not set ExpirationInDays when creating S3 Ini-
                 tiate Restore Object jobs that target S3  Intelligent-Tiering
                 Archive  Access and Deep Archive Access tier objects. Objects
                 in S3 Intelligent-Tiering archive access tiers are  not  sub-
                 ject  to  restore  expiry, so specifying ExpirationInDays re-
                 sults in restore request failure.

                 S3 Batch Operations jobs can operate either on S3 Glacier and
                 S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class objects or on S3 Intel-
                 ligent-Tiering Archive Access and Deep Archive Access storage
                 tier objects, but not both types in the same job. If you need
                 to restore objects of both types  you  must  create  separate
                 Batch Operations jobs.

              GlacierJobTier -> (string)
                 S3  Batch  Operations  supports  STANDARD  and BULK retrieval
                 tiers, but not the EXPEDITED retrieval tier.

          S3PutObjectLegalHold -> (structure)
              Contains the configuration for an S3 Object Lock legal hold  op-
              eration  that  an S3 Batch Operations job passes to every object
              to the underlying PutObjectLegalHold API operation. For more in-
              formation, see Using S3 Object Lock legal hold with S3 Batch Op-
              erations in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     objects in the Batch Operations job.

          S3PutObjectRetention -> (structure)
              Contains the configuration parameters for the Object Lock reten-
              tion  action  for  an  S3 Batch Operations job. Batch Operations
              passes every object to the underlying PutObjectRetention API op-
              eration.  For  more information, see Using S3 Object Lock reten-
              tion with S3 Batch Operations in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              NOTE:
                 This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

              BypassGovernanceRetention -> (boolean)
                 Indicates if the action should be applied to objects  in  the
                 Batch Operations job even if they have Object Lock GOVERNANCE
                 type in place.

              Retention -> (structure)
                 Contains the Object Lock retention mode to be applied to  all
                 objects  in  the  Batch Operations job. For more information,

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an Amazon S3 batch operations job

       The  following create-job example creates an Amazon S3 batch operations
       job to tag objects as confidential` in the bucket ``employee-records.

          aws s3control create-job \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --operation '{"S3PutObjectTagging": { "TagSet": [{"Key":"confidential", "Value":"true"}] }}' \
              --report '{"Bucket":"arn:aws:s3:::employee-records-logs","Prefix":"batch-op-create-job", "Format":"Report_CSV_20180820","Enabled":true,"ReportScope":"AllTasks"}' \
              --manifest '{"Spec":{"Format":"S3BatchOperations_CSV_20180820","Fields":["Bucket","Key"]},"Location":{"ObjectArn":"arn:aws:s3:::employee-records-logs/inv-report/7a6a9be4-072c-407e-85a2-ec3e982f773e.csv","ETag":"69f52a4e9f797e987155d9c8f5880897"}}' \
              --priority 42 \
              --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3BatchJobRole

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "93735294-df46-44d5-8638-6356f335324e"
          }

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The ID for this job. Amazon S3 generates this ID  automatically  and
          returns it after a successful Create Job request.
