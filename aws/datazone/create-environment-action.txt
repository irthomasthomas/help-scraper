OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          The description of the environment action that is being  created  in
          the environment.

       --domain-identifier (string)

          is created.

       --environment-identifier (string)

          ated.

       --name (string)
          The name of the environment action.

       --parameters (tagged union structure)
          The parameters of the environment action.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: awsConsoleLink.

          awsConsoleLink -> (structure)
              The console link specified as part of the environment action.

              uri -> (string)
                 The URI of the console link specified as part of the environ-
                 ment action.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          awsConsoleLink={uri=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "awsConsoleLink": {
              "uri": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
