              level keys can be set: listing.

          listing -> (structure)
              The listing for which a subscription is to be granted.

              identifier -> (string)
                 An identifier of revision to be made to an asset published in
                 a Amazon DataZone catalog.

       JSON Syntax:

          {

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON

       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
