OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          The  description  to be updated as part of the UpdateEnvironment ac-
          tion.

       --domain-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the domain in which the environment is to  be  up-
          dated.

       --glossary-terms (list)
          The  glossary  terms  to be updated as part of the UpdateEnvironment
          action.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --identifier (string)
          The identifier of the environment that is to be updated.

       --name (string)
          The name to be updated as part of the UpdateEnvironment action.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
