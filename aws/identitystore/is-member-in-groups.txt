NAME
       is-member-in-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Checks the user's membership in all requested groups and returns if the

OPTIONS
       --identity-store-id (string)
          The globally unique identifier for the identity store.

       --member-id (tagged union structure)
          An object containing the identifier of a group member.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: UserId.

          UserId -> (string)
              An  object  containing  the identifiers of resources that can be
              members.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          UserId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "UserId": "string"
          }

       --group-ids (list)
          A list of identifiers for groups in the identity store.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

OUTPUT
       Results -> (list)
          A list containing the results of membership existence checks.

          (structure)
              Indicates whether a resource is a member of a group in the iden-
              tity store.

              GroupId -> (string)
                 The identifier for a group in the identity store.

              MemberId -> (tagged union structure)
                 An object that contains the identifier  of  a  group  member.
                 Setting  the  UserID  field  to the specific identifier for a
                 user indicates that the user is a member of the group.

                 UserId -> (string)
