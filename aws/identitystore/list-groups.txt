LIST-GROUPS()                                                    LIST-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  groups  in  the identity store. Returns a paginated list of
       complete Group objects. Filtering for a Group by the DisplayName attri-
       bute is deprecated. Instead, use the GetGroupId API action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-groups  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Groups

OPTIONS
       --identity-store-id (string)
          The globally unique identifier  for  the  identity  store,  such  as
          d-1234567890 . In this example, d- is a fixed prefix, and 1234567890
          is a randomly generated string that contains numbers and lower  case
          letters.  This  value  is  generated at the time that a new identity
          store is created.

       --filters (list)
          A list of Filter objects, which is used in the ListUsers  and  List-
          Groups requests.

          (structure)
              A  query  filter  used by ListUsers and ListGroups . This filter
              object provides the attribute name and attribute value to search
              users or groups.

              AttributePath -> (string)
                 The  attribute  path  that is used to specify which attribute
                 name to search. Length limit is 255 characters. For  example,
                 UserName is a valid attribute path for the ListUsers API, and
                 DisplayName is a valid attribute path for the ListGroups API.

              AttributeValue -> (string)
                 Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is
                 described as a name-value pair.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributePath=string,AttributeValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AttributePath": "string",
              "AttributeValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                 ated  and  stored  as an attribute of the group object in the
                 identity store.

          ations. This value is generated by the identity store service. It is
