CREATE-ORIGIN-ENDPOINT()                              CREATE-ORIGIN-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       create-origin-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       The endpoint is attached to a channel, and represents the output of the
       live content. You can associate multiple endpoints to a single channel.
       Each  endpoint gives players and downstream CDNs (such as Amazon Cloud-
       Front) access to the content for playback. Content can't be served from
       a  channel  until  it has an endpoint. You can create only one endpoint
       with each request.

OPTIONS
       --channel-group-name (string)
          The name that describes the channel group. The name is  the  primary
          identifier  for  the  channel group, and must be unique for your ac-
          count in the AWS Region.

       --channel-name (string)
          The name that describes the channel. The name is the primary identi-
          fier for the channel, and must be unique for your account in the AWS
          Region and channel group.

       --origin-endpoint-name (string)
          The name that describes the origin endpoint. The name is the primary
          identifier  for the origin endpoint, and must be unique for your ac-
          count in the AWS Region and channel. You can't  use  spaces  in  the
          name. You can't change the name after you create the endpoint.

       --container-type (string)
          The type of container to attach to this origin endpoint. A container
          type is a file format that encapsulates one or more  media  streams,
          such  as  audio  and video, into a single file. You can't change the
          container type after you create the endpoint.

          Possible values:

          o TS

          o CMAF

       --segment (structure)
          The segment configuration, including the segment name, duration, and
          other configuration values.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              The  duration  (in seconds) of each segment. Enter a value equal
              to, or a multiple of, the input segment duration. If  the  value
              that you enter is different from the input segment duration, Me-
              diaPackage rounds segments to the nearest multiple of the  input
              segment duration.

          SegmentName -> (string)
              The  name  that describes the segment. The name is the base name
              of the segment used in all content manifests inside of the  end-
              point. You can't use spaces in the name.

          TsUseAudioRenditionGroup -> (boolean)
              When selected, MediaPackage bundles all audio tracks in a rendi-
              tion group. All other tracks in the stream can be used with  any
              audio rendition from the group.

          IncludeIframeOnlyStreams -> (boolean)
              When  selected,  the  stream  set includes an additional I-frame
              only stream, along with the other tracks. If false,  this  extra
              stream  is  not included. MediaPackage generates an I-frame only
              stream from the first rendition in the manifest. The service in-
              serts  EXT-I-FRAMES-ONLY  tags  in the output manifest, and then
              generates and includes an I-frames only playlist in the  stream.
              This playlist permits player functionality like fast forward and
              rewind.

          TsIncludeDvbSubtitles -> (boolean)
              By default, MediaPackage excludes all digital video broadcasting
              (DVB)  subtitles  from  the  output. When selected, MediaPackage
              passes through DVB subtitles into the output.

          Scte -> (structure)
              The SCTE configuration options in the segment settings.

              ScteFilter -> (list)
                 The SCTE-35 message types that you want to be treated  as  ad
                 markers in the output.

                 (string)

          Encryption -> (structure)
              The parameters for encrypting content.

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 A  128-bit,  16-byte  hex value represented by a 32-character
                 string, used in conjunction with the key for encrypting  con-
                 tent. If you don't specify a value, then MediaPackage creates
                 the constant initialization vector (IV).

              EncryptionMethod -> (structure)
                 The encryption method to use.

                 TsEncryptionMethod -> (string)
                     The encryption method to use.

                 CmafEncryptionMethod -> (string)
                     The encryption method to use.

              KeyRotationIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                 The frequency (in seconds) of key changes for live workflows,
                 in which content is streamed real time. The service retrieves
                 content keys before the live content  begins  streaming,  and
                 then  retrieves them as needed over the lifetime of the work-
                 flow. By default, key rotation is set to 300 seconds (5  min-
                 utes),  the minimum rotation interval, which is equivalent to
                 setting it to 300. If you don't enter  an  interval,  content
                 keys aren't rotated.

                 The  following  example  setting causes the service to rotate
                 keys every thirty minutes: 1800

              SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                 The parameters for the SPEKE key provider.

                 EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Configure one or more content encryption  keys  for  your
                     endpoints that use SPEKE Version 2.0. The encryption con-
                     tract defines which content keys are used to encrypt  the
                     audio  and  video tracks in your stream. To configure the
                     encryption contract, specify which audio  and  video  en-
                     cryption presets to use.

                     PresetSpeke20Audio -> (string)
                        A collection of audio encryption presets.

                        Value description:

                 ResourceId -> (string)
                     The  unique identifier for the content. The service sends
                     this to the key server to identify the current  endpoint.
                     How  unique you make this depends on how fine-grained you
                     want access controls to be. The service does  not  permit
                     you  to  use  the same ID for two simultaneous encryption
                     processes. The resource ID is also known as  the  content
                     ID.

                     The    following    example    shows   a   resource   ID:
                     MovieNight20171126093045

                 DrmSystems -> (list)
                     The DRM solution provider you're using  to  protect  your
                     content during distribution.

                     (string)

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The ARN for the IAM role granted by the key provider that
                     provides access to the key provider API. This  role  must
                     have  a  trust  policy that allows MediaPackage to assume
                     the role, and it must have a sufficient permissions  pol-
                     icy  to  allow  access to the specific key retrieval URL.
                     Get this from your DRM solution provider.

                     Valid format: arn:aws:iam::{accountID}:role/{name} .  The
                     following      example      shows     a     role     ARN:
                     arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/SpekeAccess

                 Url -> (string)
                     The URL of the API Gateway proxy that you set up to  talk
                     to  your key server. The API Gateway proxy must reside in
                     the same AWS Region as MediaPackage and must  start  with
                     https://.

                     The following example shows a URL: https://1wm2dx1f33.ex-

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the idem-
          potency of the request.

       --description (string)
          Enter any descriptive text that helps you  to  identify  the  origin
          endpoint.

       --startover-window-seconds (integer)
          The  size  of the window (in seconds) to create a window of the live
          stream  that's  available  for  on-demand   viewing.   Viewers   can
          start-over  or catch-up on content that falls within the window. The
          maximum startover window is 1,209,600 seconds (14 days).

       --hls-manifests (list)
          An HTTP live streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

          (structure)
              Create an HTTP live streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

              ManifestName -> (string)
                 A short short string that's appended to the endpoint URL. The
                 manifest  name creates a unique path to this endpoint. If you
                 don't enter a value, MediaPackage uses the  default  manifest
                 name,  index.  MediaPackage  automatically inserts the format
                 extension, such as .m3u8. You can't  use  the  same  manifest
                 name  if  you  use HLS manifest and low-latency HLS manifest.
                 The manifestName on the HLSManifest object overrides the man-
                 ifestName you provided on the originEndpoint object.

              ChildManifestName -> (string)
                 A short string that's appended to the endpoint URL. The child
                 manifest name creates a unique path to this endpoint. If  you
                 don't  enter  a value, MediaPackage uses the default manifest
                 name, index, with an added suffix to distinguish it from  the
                 manifest  name.  The  manifestName  on the HLSManifest object
                 overrides the manifestName you provided on the originEndpoint
                 object.

              ScteHls -> (structure)
                 The SCTE configuration.

                 AdMarkerHls -> (string)
                     Ad  markers  indicate  when ads should be inserted during
                     playback. If you include ad markers in the content stream
                     in your upstream encoders, then you need to inform Media-
                     Package what to do with the ad  markers  in  the  output.
                     Choose what you want MediaPackage to do with the ad mark-

                       and program transition events in TS and CMAF manifests.
                       If you use DATERANGE, you must set a programDateTimeIn-
                       tervalSeconds value of 1 or higher. To learn more about
                       DATERANGE, see SCTE-35 Ad Marker EXT-X-DATERANGE .

              ManifestWindowSeconds -> (integer)
                 The total duration (in seconds) of the manifest's content.

              ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                 Inserts EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags in the  output  manifest
                 at  the  interval that you specify. If you don't enter an in-
                 terval, EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags aren't included  in  the
                 manifest.  The tags sync the stream to the wall clock so that
                 viewers can seek to a specific time in the playback  timeline
                 on  the  player.  ID3Timed metadata messages generate every 5
                 seconds whenever the content is ingested.

                 Irrespective of this parameter, if any ID3Timed  metadata  is
                 in the HLS input, it is passed through to the HLS output.

       --low-latency-hls-manifests (list)
          A low-latency HLS manifest configuration.

          (structure)
              Create a low-latency HTTP live streaming (HLS) manifest configu-
              ration.

              ManifestName -> (string)
                 A short short string that's appended to the endpoint URL. The
                 manifest  name creates a unique path to this endpoint. If you
                 don't enter a value, MediaPackage uses the  default  manifest
                 name,  index.  MediaPackage  automatically inserts the format
                 extension, such as .m3u8. You can't  use  the  same  manifest
                 name  if  you  use HLS manifest and low-latency HLS manifest.
                 The manifestName on the HLSManifest object overrides the man-
                 ifestName you provided on the originEndpoint object.

              ChildManifestName -> (string)
                 A short string that's appended to the endpoint URL. The child
                 manifest name creates a unique path to this endpoint. If  you
                 don't  enter  a value, MediaPackage uses the default manifest
                 name, index, with an added suffix to distinguish it from  the
                 manifest  name.  The  manifestName  on the HLSManifest object
                 overrides the manifestName you provided on the originEndpoint
                 object.

              ScteHls -> (structure)
                 The SCTE configuration.

                 AdMarkerHls -> (string)
                     Ad  markers  indicate  when ads should be inserted during
                     playback. If you include ad markers in the content stream
                     in your upstream encoders, then you need to inform Media-
                     Package what to do with the ad  markers  in  the  output.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the resource.

       ChannelGroupName -> (string)
          The  name  that describes the channel group. The name is the primary
          identifier for the channel group, and must be unique  for  your  ac-
          count in the AWS Region.

       ChannelName -> (string)
          The name that describes the channel. The name is the primary identi-
          fier for the channel, and must be unique for your account in the AWS
          Region and channel group.

       OriginEndpointName -> (string)
          The name that describes the origin endpoint. The name is the primary
          identifier for the origin endpoint, and and must be unique for  your
          account in the AWS Region and channel.

       ContainerType -> (string)
          The type of container attached to this origin endpoint.

       Segment -> (structure)
          The segment configuration, including the segment name, duration, and
          other configuration values.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              The duration (in seconds) of each segment. Enter a  value  equal
              to,  or  a multiple of, the input segment duration. If the value
              that you enter is different from the input segment duration, Me-
              diaPackage  rounds segments to the nearest multiple of the input
              segment duration.

          SegmentName -> (string)
              The name that describes the segment. The name is the  base  name
              of  the segment used in all content manifests inside of the end-
              point. You can't use spaces in the name.

          TsUseAudioRenditionGroup -> (boolean)
              When selected, MediaPackage bundles all audio tracks in a rendi-
              tion  group. All other tracks in the stream can be used with any
              audio rendition from the group.

          IncludeIframeOnlyStreams -> (boolean)
              When selected, the stream set  includes  an  additional  I-frame
              only  stream,  along with the other tracks. If false, this extra
              stream is not included. MediaPackage generates an  I-frame  only
              stream from the first rendition in the manifest. The service in-
              serts EXT-I-FRAMES-ONLY tags in the output  manifest,  and  then
              generates  and includes an I-frames only playlist in the stream.
              This playlist permits player functionality like fast forward and
              rewind.

          TsIncludeDvbSubtitles -> (boolean)
              By default, MediaPackage excludes all digital video broadcasting
              (DVB) subtitles from the  output.  When  selected,  MediaPackage
              passes through DVB subtitles into the output.

                 markers in the output.

                 (string)

          Encryption -> (structure)
              The parameters for encrypting content.

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 A 128-bit, 16-byte hex value represented  by  a  32-character
                 string,  used in conjunction with the key for encrypting con-
                 tent. If you don't specify a value, then MediaPackage creates
                 the constant initialization vector (IV).

              EncryptionMethod -> (structure)
                 The encryption method to use.

                 TsEncryptionMethod -> (string)
                     The encryption method to use.

                 CmafEncryptionMethod -> (string)
                     The encryption method to use.

              KeyRotationIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                 The frequency (in seconds) of key changes for live workflows,
                 in which content is streamed real time. The service retrieves
                 content  keys  before  the live content begins streaming, and
                 then retrieves them as needed over the lifetime of the  work-
                 flow.  By default, key rotation is set to 300 seconds (5 min-
                 utes), the minimum rotation interval, which is equivalent  to
                 setting  it  to  300. If you don't enter an interval, content
                 keys aren't rotated.

                 The following example setting causes the  service  to  rotate
                 keys every thirty minutes: 1800

              SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                 The parameters for the SPEKE key provider.

                 EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)

                     endpoints that use SPEKE Version 2.0. The encryption con-
                     tract  defines which content keys are used to encrypt the
                     audio and video tracks in your stream. To  configure  the
                     encryption  contract,  specify  which audio and video en-
                     cryption presets to use.

                     PresetSpeke20Audio -> (string)
                        A collection of audio encryption presets.

                     this  to the key server to identify the current endpoint.
                     How unique you make this depends on how fine-grained  you
                     want  access  controls to be. The service does not permit
                     you to use the same ID for  two  simultaneous  encryption
                     processes.  The  resource ID is also known as the content
                     ID.

                     The   following   example   shows    a    resource    ID:

                 DrmSystems -> (list)
                     The  DRM  solution  provider you're using to protect your
                     content during distribution.

                     (string)

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The ARN for the IAM role granted by the key provider that
                     provides  access  to the key provider API. This role must
                     have a trust policy that allows  MediaPackage  to  assume
                     the  role, and it must have a sufficient permissions pol-
                     icy to allow access to the specific  key  retrieval  URL.
                     Get this from your DRM solution provider.

                     Valid  format: arn:aws:iam::{accountID}:role/{name} . The
                     following     example     shows     a      role      ARN:
                     arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/SpekeAccess

                 Url -> (string)
                     The  URL of the API Gateway proxy that you set up to talk
                     to your key server. The API Gateway proxy must reside  in
                     the  same  AWS Region as MediaPackage and must start with
                     https://.

                     The following example shows a URL: https://1wm2dx1f33.ex-
                     ecute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/SpekeSample/copyProtec-
                     tion

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the origin endpoint was created.

       ModifiedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the origin endpoint was modified.

       Description -> (string)
          The description for your origin endpoint.

       StartoverWindowSeconds -> (integer)
          The size of the window (in seconds) to create a window of  the  live
          stream   that's   available   for  on-demand  viewing.  Viewers  can
          start-over or catch-up on content that falls within the window.

       HlsManifests -> (list)
          An HTTP live streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

          (structure)
              Retrieve the HTTP live streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

              ManifestName -> (string)
                 A short short string that's appended to the endpoint URL. The
                 manifest  name creates a unique path to this endpoint. If you
                 don't enter a value, MediaPackage uses the  default  manifest
                 name,  index.  MediaPackage  automatically inserts the format
                 extension, such as .m3u8. You can't  use  the  same  manifest
                 name  if  you  use HLS manifest and low-latency HLS manifest.
                 The manifestName on the HLSManifest object overrides the man-
                 ifestName you provided on the originEndpoint object.

              Url -> (string)
                 The egress domain URL for stream delivery from MediaPackage.

              ChildManifestName -> (string)
                 A short string that's appended to the endpoint URL. The child
                 manifest name creates a unique path to this endpoint. If  you
                 don't enter a value, MediaPackage uses the default child man-
                 ifest name, index_1. The manifestName on the HLSManifest  ob-
                 ject  overrides  the  manifestName you provided on the origi-
                 nEndpoint object.

              ManifestWindowSeconds -> (integer)
                 The total duration (in seconds) of the manifest's content.

              ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                 Inserts EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags in the  output  manifest
                 at  the  interval that you specify. If you don't enter an in-
                 terval, EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags aren't included  in  the
                 manifest.  The tags sync the stream to the wall clock so that
                 viewers can seek to a specific time in the playback  timeline
                 on  the  player.  ID3Timed metadata messages generate every 5
                 seconds whenever the content is ingested.

                 Irrespective of this parameter, if any ID3Timed  metadata  is
                 in the HLS input, it is passed through to the HLS output.

              ScteHls -> (structure)
                 The SCTE configuration.

                 AdMarkerHls -> (string)
                     Ad  markers  indicate  when ads should be inserted during
                     playback. If you include ad markers in the content stream
                     in your upstream encoders, then you need to inform Media-
                     Package what to do with the ad  markers  in  the  output.
                     Choose what you want MediaPackage to do with the ad mark-
                     ers.

                       and program transition events in TS and CMAF manifests.
                       If you use DATERANGE, you must set a programDateTimeIn-
                       tervalSeconds value of 1 or higher. To learn more about
                       DATERANGE, see SCTE-35 Ad Marker EXT-X-DATERANGE .

       LowLatencyHlsManifests -> (list)

                 name if you use HLS manifest and  low-latency  HLS  manifest.
                 The manifestName on the HLSManifest object overrides the man-
                 ifestName you provided on the originEndpoint object.

              Url -> (string)
                 The egress domain URL for stream delivery from MediaPackage.

              ManifestWindowSeconds -> (integer)
                 The total duration (in seconds) of the manifest's content.

              ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                 Inserts  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME  tags in the output manifest
                 at the interval that you specify. If you don't enter  an  in-
