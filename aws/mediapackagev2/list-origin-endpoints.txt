LIST-ORIGIN-ENDPOINTS()                                LIST-ORIGIN-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       list-origin-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  all  origin endpoints in a specific channel that are config-
       ured in AWS Elemental MediaPackage.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-origin-endpoints is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Items

OPTIONS
       --channel-group-name (string)
          The  name  that describes the channel group. The name is the primary
          identifier for the channel group, and must be unique  for  your  ac-
          count in the AWS Region.

       --channel-name (string)
          The name that describes the channel. The name is the primary identi-
          fier for the channel, and must be unique for your account in the AWS
          Region and channel group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

                 primary identifier for the origin endpoint, and and  must  be
                 unique for your account in the AWS Region and channel.

              ContainerType -> (string)

                 The date and time the origin endpoint was created.

              ModifiedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the origin endpoint was modified.

              HlsManifests -> (list)
                 An HTTP live streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                 (structure)
                     List the HTTP live streaming  (HLS)  manifest  configura-
                     tion.

                     ManifestName -> (string)
                        A  short  short string that's appended to the endpoint
                        URL. The manifest name creates a unique path  to  this
                        endpoint.  If  you  don't  enter a value, MediaPackage
                        uses the default manifest  name,  index.  MediaPackage
                        automatically  inserts  the  format extension, such as
                        .m3u8. You can't use the same manifest name if you use
                        HLS  manifest  and low-latency HLS manifest. The mani-
                        festName on the HLSManifest object overrides the mani-
                        festName you provided on the originEndpoint object.

                     ChildManifestName -> (string)
                        A  short  string  that's appended to the endpoint URL.
                        The child manifest name creates a unique path to  this
                        endpoint.  If  you  don't  enter a value, MediaPackage
                        uses the default child  manifest  name,  index_1.  The
                        manifestName  on  the HLSManifest object overrides the
                        manifestName you provided on  the  originEndpoint  ob-
                        ject.

                     Url -> (string)
                        The  egress domain URL for stream delivery from Media-

                        A  short  short string that's appended to the endpoint
                        URL. The manifest name creates a unique path  to  this
                        endpoint.  If  you  don't  enter a value, MediaPackage
                        uses the default manifest  name,  index.  MediaPackage
                        automatically  inserts  the  format extension, such as
                        .m3u8. You can't use the same manifest name if you use
                        HLS  manifest  and low-latency HLS manifest. The mani-
                        festName on the HLSManifest object overrides the mani-

                        manifestName you provided on  the  originEndpoint  ob-
                        ject.

                     Url -> (string)
                        The  egress domain URL for stream delivery from Media-
                        Package.
