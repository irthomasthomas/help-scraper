CREATE-CHANNEL()                                              CREATE-CHANNEL()



NAME
       create-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Create a channel to start receiving content streams. The channel repre-
       sents the input to MediaPackage for incoming live content from  an  en-
       coder  such  as  AWS Elemental MediaLive. The channel receives content,
       and after packaging it, outputs it through an origin endpoint to  down-
       stream  devices  (such  as video players or CDNs) that request the con-
       tent. You can create only one channel with each request.  We  recommend
       that  you  spread  out channels between channel groups, such as putting
       redundant channels in the same AWS Region in different channel groups.

OPTIONS
       --channel-group-name (string)
          The name that describes the channel group. The name is  the  primary
          identifier  for  the  channel group, and must be unique for your ac-
          count in the AWS Region.

       --channel-name (string)
          The name that describes the channel. The name is the primary identi-
          fier for the channel, and must be unique for your account in the AWS
          Region and channel group. You can't change the name after you create
          the channel.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the idem-
          potency of the request.

       --input-type (string)
          The input type will be an immutable field which will be used to  de-
          fine  whether  the  channel will allow CMAF ingest or HLS ingest. If
          unprovided, it will default to HLS to preserve current behavior.

          The allowed values are:

          o HLS - The HLS streaming specification (which  defines  M3U8  mani-
            fests and TS segments).

          o CMAF  -  The DASH-IF CMAF Ingest specification (which defines CMAF
            segments with optional DASH manifests).

          Possible values:

          o HLS

          o CMAF

       --description (string)
          Enter any descriptive text that helps you to identify the channel.

       --tags (map)
          A comma-separated list of tag key:value pairs that you  define.  For
          example:
              "Key1": "Value1",

              "Key2": "Value2"

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
