DESCRIPTION

       or egress access logs to the CloudWatch log group, if content  will  be
       encrypted, the description on a channel, and your channel's policy set-
       tings. You can't edit the name of the channel or  CloudFront  distribu-
       tion details.

       Any  edits  you  make that impact the video output may not be reflected

OPTIONS
       --channel-group-name (string)
          The name that describes the channel group. The name is  the  primary
          identifier  for  the  channel group, and must be unique for your ac-
          count in the AWS Region.

       --channel-name (string)
          The name that describes the channel. The name is the primary identi-
          fier for the channel, and must be unique for your account in the AWS
          Region and channel group.

       --description (string)
          Any descriptive information that you want to add to the channel  for
          future identification purposes.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
