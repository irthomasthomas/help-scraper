LIST-OPPORTUNITIES()                                      LIST-OPPORTUNITIES()



NAME
       list-opportunities -

DESCRIPTION
       This  request  accepts a list of filters that retrieve opportunity sub-
       sets as well as sort options. This feature  is  available  to  partners
       from Partner Central using the ListOpportunities API action.

       To  synchronize your system with Amazon Web Services, only list the op-
       portunities that were newly created or updated. We recommend  you  rely
       on events emitted by the service into your Amazon Web Services accounts
       Amazon EventBridge default event bus, you can also use the ListOpportu-
       nities action.

       We recommend the following approach:

       o Find  the  latest  LastModifiedDate that you stored, and only use the
         values that came from Amazon Web Services. Dont use values  generated
         by your system.

       o When  you  send  a  ListOpportunities request, submit the date in ISO
         8601 format in the AfterLastModifiedDate filter.

       o Amazon Web Services only returns opportunities created or updated  on
         or after that date and time. Use NextToken to iterate over all pages.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-opportunities  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: OpportunitySummaries

OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          Specifies the catalog associated with the request. This field  takes
          a  string value from a predefined list: AWS or Sandbox . The catalog
          determines which environment the opportunities are  listed  in.  Use
          AWS  for listing real opportunities in the Amazon Web Services cata-
          log, and Sandbox for testing in secure, isolated environments.

       --customer-company-name (list)
          Filters the opportunities based on the customer's company name. This
          allows  partners  to search for opportunities associated with a spe-
          cific customer by matching the provided company name string.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --identifier (list)
          Filters the opportunities based on the opportunity identifier.  This
          allows  partners  to  retrieve  specific  opportunities by providing
          their unique identifiers, ensuring precise results.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --last-modified-date (structure)
          Filters the opportunities based on their last  modified  date.  This
          filter  helps  retrieve  opportunities  that  were updated after the
          specified date, allowing partners to track  recent  changes  or  up-
          dates.

          AfterLastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              Specifies  the date after which the opportunities were modified.
              Use this filter to retrieve only those opportunities  that  were
              modified after a given timestamp.

          BeforeLastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the date before which the opportunities were modified.
              Use this filter to retrieve only those opportunities  that  were
              modified before a given timestamp.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AfterLastModifiedDate=timestamp,BeforeLastModifiedDate=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AfterLastModifiedDate": timestamp,
            "BeforeLastModifiedDate": timestamp
          }

       --life-cycle-review-status (list)
          Filters  the opportunities based on their current lifecycle approval
          status. Use this filter to retrieve opportunities with statuses such
          as Pending Submission , In Review , Action Required , or Approved .

          (string)

       Syntax:

            Submitted
            In review
            Approved
            Rejected
            Action Required

       --life-cycle-stage (list)
          Filters  the opportunities based on their lifecycle stage. This fil-
          ter allows partners to retrieve opportunities at various  stages  in
          the sales cycle, such as Qualified , Technical Validation , Business
          Validation , or Closed Won .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:

            Committed
            Launched
            Closed Lost

       --sort (structure)
          An object that specifies how the response  is  sorted.  The  default
          Sort.SortBy value is LastModifiedDate .

          SortBy -> (string)
              Field name to sort by.

          SortOrder -> (string)
              Sort order.

              Default: Descending

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SortBy": "LastModifiedDate"|"Identifier"|"CustomerCompanyName",
            "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

                     solved,  and  the opportunity's Lifecycle.ReviewStatus is
                     set to Approved or Rejected .

                     o Approved: Validated and converted into the  Amazon  Web

                     Indicates the reason a specific decision was taken during
                     the opportunity review process. This field  combines  the
                     reasons  for  both  disqualified and action required sta-
                     tuses, and provides clarity for why  an  opportunity  was
                     disqualified or required further action.

                 Stage -> (string)
                     Specifies the current stage of the Opportunity 's lifecy-
                     cle as it maps to Amazon Web  Services  stages  from  the
                     current  stage  in the partner CRM. This field provides a
                     translated value of the stage, and  offers  insight  into
                     the  Opportunity  's  progression in the sales cycle, ac-
                     cording to Amazon Web Services definitions.

                     NOTE:
                        A lead and a prospect must be  further  matured  to  a
                        Qualified opportunity before submission. Opportunities
                        that were closed/lost before submission  aren't  suit-
                        able for submission.

                     The descriptions of each sales stage are:

                     o Prospect:  Amazon  Web Services identifies the opportu-
                       nity. It can be active (Comes  directly  from  the  end
                       customer  through  a lead) or latent (Your account team
                       believes it exists based on  research,  account  plans,
                       sales plays).

                     o Qualified:  Your account team engaged with the customer
                       to discuss viability and understand  requirements.  The
                       customer agreed that the opportunity is real, of inter-
                       est, and may solve business/technical needs.

                     o Technical Validation: All parties understand the imple-
                       mentation plan.

                     o Business Validation: Pricing was proposed, and all par-
                       ties agree to the steps to close.

                     o Committed: The customer signed the contract, but Amazon
                       Web Services hasn't started billing.

                     o Launched: The workload is complete, and Amazon Web Ser-
                       vices has started billing.

                     o Closed Lost: The opportunity is lost, and there are  no
                       steps to move forward.

                 TargetCloseDate -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  date  when Amazon Web Services expects to
                     start significant billing, when the project finishes, and
                     when  it  moves  into  production. This field informs the
                     Amazon Web Services seller  about  when  the  opportunity
                     launches and starts to incur Amazon Web Services usage.

                     Ensure the Target Close Date isn't in the past.

              OpportunityType -> (string)
                 Specifies opportunity type as a renewal, new, or expansion.

                 Opportunity types:

                 o Renewal  Opportunity: Represents an opportunity to renew an
                   existing contract or subscription with a current  customer,

                   the scope of an existing contract or  subscription,  either

                 cile because it's included in the outbound payload sent  back
                 to  the partner. It allows partners to link an opportunity to
