START-ENGAGEMENT-BY-ACCEPTING-ISTART-ENGAGEMENT-BY-ACCEPTING-INVITATION-TASK()



NAME
       start-engagement-by-accepting-invitation-task -

DESCRIPTION
       This  action starts the engagement by accepting an EngagementInvitation
       . The task is asynchronous and involves the following steps:  accepting
       the  invitation,  creating  an opportunity in the partners account from
       the AWS opportunity, and copying details for tracking. When  completed,
       an Opportunity Created event is generated, indicating that the opportu-
       nity has been successfully created in the partner's account.

OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          Specifies the catalog related to the task. Use  AWS  for  production
          engagements and Sandbox for testing scenarios.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  provided  by the client that
          helps to ensure the idempotency of the request. This can be a random
          or meaningful string but must be unique for each request.

       --identifier (string)
          Specifies  the  unique  identifier of the EngagementInvitation to be
          accepted. Providing the correct identifier  helps  ensure  that  the
          correct engagement is processed.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
