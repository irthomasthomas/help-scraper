DISASSOCIATE-OPPORTUNITY()                          DISASSOCIATE-OPPORTUNITY()



NAME
       disassociate-opportunity -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows you to remove an existing association between an Opportunity and
       related entities, such as a Partner Solution, Amazon Web Services prod-
       uct, or an Amazon Web Services Marketplace offer. This operation is the
       counterpart to AssociateOpportunity , and it  provides  flexibility  to
       manage associations as business needs change.

       Use  this operation to update the associations of an Opportunity due to
       changes in the related entities, or if an association was made  in  er-
       ror. Ensuring accurate associations helps maintain clarity and accuracy
       to track and manage business opportunities. When you replace an entity,
       first  attach  the  new  entity and then disassociate the one to be re-
       moved, especially if it's the last remaining entity that's required.

OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          Specifies the catalog associated with the request. This field  takes
          a  string value from a predefined list: AWS or Sandbox . The catalog
          determines which environment the opportunity disassociation is  made
          in. Use AWS to disassociate opportunities in the Amazon Web Services
          catalog, and Sandbox for testing in secure, isolated environments.

       --opportunity-identifier (string)
          The opportunity's unique identifier for when you want to  disassoci-
          ate  it  from related entities. This identifier helps to ensure that
          the correct opportunity is updated.

          Validation: Ensure that the provided identifier  corresponds  to  an
          existing  opportunity  in the Amazon Web Services system because in-
          correct identifiers result in an error and no changes are made.

       --related-entity-identifier (string)
          The related entity's identifier that you want to  disassociate  from
          the  opportunity.  Depending  on the type of entity, this could be a
          simple identifier or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for entities man-
          aged through Amazon Web Services Marketplace.

          For  Amazon  Web  Services  Marketplace entities, use the Amazon Web
          Services Marketplace API to obtain the necessary ARNs. For  guidance
          on  retrieving  these ARNs, see Amazon Web Services MarketplaceUsing
          the Amazon Web Services Marketplace Catalog API .

          Validation: Ensure the identifier or ARN is valid and corresponds to
          an existing entity. An incorrect or invalid identifier results in an
          error.

       --related-entity-type (string)
          The type of the entity that you're disassociating from the  opportu-
          nity.  When  you  specify  the entity type, it helps the system cor-
          rectly process the disassociation request to ensure that  the  right
          connections are removed.

          Examples  of  entity types include Partner Solution, Amazon Web Ser-
          vices product, and Amazon Web Services Marketplaceoffer. Ensure that
          the value matches one of the expected entity types.

          Validation:  Provide  a  valid entity type to help ensure successful
          disassociation. An invalid or incorrect entity type  results  in  an
          error.

          Possible values:

          o Solutions

          o AwsProducts

          o AwsMarketplaceOffers

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
