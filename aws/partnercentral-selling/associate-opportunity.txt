OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          Specifies the catalog associated with the request. This field  takes
          a  string value from a predefined list: AWS or Sandbox . The catalog
          determines which environment the opportunity association is made in.
          Use  AWS to associate opportunities in the Amazon Web Services cata-
          log, and Sandbox for testing in secure, isolated environments.

       --opportunity-identifier (string)
          Requires the Opportunity 's unique identifier when you want to asso-
          ciate  it  with  a related entity. Provide the correct identifier so
          the intended opportunity is updated with the association.

       --related-entity-identifier (string)
          Requires the related entity's unique identifier when you want to as-
          sociate  it  with  the Opportunity . For Amazon Web Services Market-
          place entities, provide the Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN).  Use  the
          Amazon Web Services Marketplace API to obtain the ARN.

       --related-entity-type (string)
          Specifies  the entity type that you're associating with the Opportu-
          nity . This helps to categorize and properly  process  the  associa-
          tion.

          Possible values:

          o Solutions

          o AwsProducts

          o AwsMarketplaceOffers

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
