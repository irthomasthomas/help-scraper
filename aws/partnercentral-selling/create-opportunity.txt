NAME
       create-opportunity -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Opportunity record in Partner Central. Use this operation to
       create a potential business opportunity for submission  to  Amazon  Web
       Services.  Creating an opportunity sets Lifecycle.ReviewStatus to Pend-
       ing Submission .

       To submit an opportunity, follow these steps:

       o To create the opportunity, use CreateOpportunity .

       o To associate a solution with the opportunity,  use  AssociateOpportu-
         nity .

       o To submit the opportunity, use StartEngagementFromOpportunityTask .

       After  submission,  you  can't edit the opportunity until the review is
       complete. But opportunities in the Pending Submission state  must  have
       complete  details.  You  can  update  the opportunity while it's in the
       Pending Submission state.

       There's a set of mandatory fields to create opportunities, but consider
       providing optional fields to enrich the opportunity record.

OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          Specifies  the catalog associated with the request. This field takes
          a string value from a predefined list: AWS or Sandbox . The  catalog
          determines  which environment the opportunity is created in. Use AWS
          to create opportunities in the  Amazon  Web  Services  catalog,  and
          Sandbox for testing in secure, isolated environments.

       --client-token (string)
          Required  to be unique, and should be unchanging, it can be randomly
          generated or a meaningful string.

          Default: None

          Best practice: To help ensure uniqueness and avoid conflicts, use  a
          Universally  Unique  Identifier  (UUID) as the ClientToken . You can
          use standard libraries from most programming languages  to  generate
          this.  If you use the same client token, the API returns the follow-
          ing error: "Conflicting client token submitted  for  a  new  request
          body."

          ReviewStatus -> (string)

                need  to  be addressed. Partners should use the UpdateOpportu-
                nity API action to update the opportunity and helps to  ensure

              portunity's  Lifecycle.ReviewStatus  is  set  to Approved or Re-
              jected .

              Indicates  the reason a decision was made during the opportunity
              review process. This field combines the reasons  for  both  dis-
              qualified  and action required statuses, and provide clarity for
              why an opportunity was disqualified or requires further action.

          Stage -> (string)
              Specifies the current stage of the Opportunity 's  lifecycle  as
              it  maps to Amazon Web Services stages from the current stage in

              stage, and offers insight into the Opportunity 's progression in
              the sales cycle, according to Amazon Web Services definitions.

              NOTE:
                 A lead and a prospect must be further matured to a  Qualified
                 opportunity   before   submission.  Opportunities  that  were
                 closed/lost before submission aren't suitable for submission.

              The descriptions of each sales stage are:

              o Prospect: Amazon Web Services identifies the  opportunity.  It
                can  be active (Comes directly from the end customer through a
                lead) or latent (Your account team believes it exists based on
                research, account plans, sales plays).

              o Qualified: Your account team engaged with the customer to dis-
                cuss viability and requirements. The customer agreed that  the
                opportunity is real, of interest, and may solve business/tech-
                nical needs.

              o Technical Validation: All parties understand  the  implementa-
                tion plan.

              o Business  Validation:  Pricing  was  proposed, and all parties
                agree to the steps to close.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          Read-only, system-generated Opportunity  unique  identifier.  Amazon

          missions.  It  helps  to  ensure that each opportunity is accurately
          tracked and managed.
