LIST-ENGAGEMENT-MEMBERS()                            LIST-ENGAGEMENT-MEMBERS()



NAME
       list-engagement-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the details of member partners in an engagement. This opera-
       tion can only be invoked by members of the engagement. The  ListEngage-
       mentMembers operation allows you to fetch information about the members
       of a specific engagement. This action is restricted to members  of  the
       engagement being queried.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-engagement-members  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: EngagementMemberList

OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          The catalog related to the request.

       --identifier (string)
          Identifier of the engagement record to retrieve members from.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EngagementMemberList -> (list)
          Provides a list of engagement members.

          (structure)
              Engagement  members are the participants in an Engagement, which
              is likely a collaborative project or business opportunity within
              the  AWS partner network. Members can be different partner orga-
              nizations or AWS accounts that are working together  on  a  spe-
              cific engagement.

              Each  member  is  represented  by  their AWS Account ID, Company
              Name, and associated details. Members have a status  within  the
              Engagement (PENDING, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, or WITHDRAWN), indicat-
              ing their current state of participation. Only existing  members
              of  an  Engagement  can view the list of other members. This im-
              plies a level of privacy and access control within  the  Engage-
              ment structure.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 This  is the unique identifier for the AWS account associated
                 with the member organization. It's used for AWS-related oper-
                 ations and identity verification.

              CompanyName -> (string)
                 The official name of the member's company or organization.

              WebsiteUrl -> (string)
                 The URL of the member company's website. This offers a way to
                 find more  information  about  the  member  organization  and
                 serves as an additional identifier.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  pagination  token  used  to  retrieve the next set of results. If
          there are more results available than can be returned  in  a  single
          response, this token will be present. Use this token in a subsequent
          request to retrieve the next page of results. If there are  no  more
          results, this value will be null.
