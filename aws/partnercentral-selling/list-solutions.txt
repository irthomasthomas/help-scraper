LIST-SOLUTIONS()                                              LIST-SOLUTIONS()



NAME
       list-solutions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of Partner Solutions that the partner registered on
       Partner Central. This API is used to generate a list of solutions  that
       an end user selects from for association with an opportunity.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-solutions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: SolutionSummaries

OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          Specifies the catalog associated with the request. This field  takes
          a  string value from a predefined list: AWS or Sandbox . The catalog
          determines which environment the solutions are listed in. Use AWS to
          list  solutions  in  the Amazon Web Services catalog, and Sandbox to
          list solutions in a secure and isolated testing environment.

       --category (list)
          Filters the solutions based on the category to  which  they  belong.
          This  allows  partners to search for solutions within specific cate-
          gories, such as Software , Consulting , or Managed Services .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --identifier (list)
          Filters the solutions based on their  unique  identifier.  Use  this
          filter  to  retrieve  specific solutions by providing the solution's
          identifier for accurate results.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --sort (structure)
          Object  that  configures  sorting  done  on  the  response.  Default
          Sort.SortBy is Identifier .

          SortBy -> (string)
              Specifies the attribute to sort by, such as Name , CreatedDate ,
              or Status .

          SortOrder -> (string)
              Specifies the sorting order, either Ascending  or  Descending  .
              The default is Descending .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SortBy=string,SortOrder=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SortBy": "Identifier"|"Name"|"Status"|"Category"|"CreatedDate",
            "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
          }

       --status (list)
          Filters  solutions based on their status. This filter helps partners
          manage their solution portfolios effectively.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Active
            Inactive
            Draft

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A  pagination token used to retrieve the next set of results in sub-
          sequent calls. This token is included in the response only if  there
          are additional result pages available.

       SolutionSummaries -> (list)
          An  array  with  minimal  details for solutions matching the request
          criteria.

          (structure)
              Specifies minimal information for the solution offered to  solve
              the customer's business problem.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  SolutionBase  structure  provides  essential information
                 about a solution.

              Catalog -> (string)
                 Specifies the catalog in which the solution is hosted, either
                 AWS  or  Sandbox  . This helps partners differentiate between
                 live solutions and those in testing environments.

              Category -> (string)
                 Specifies the solution category, which  helps  to  categorize
                 and  organize  the  solutions  partners  offer. Valid values:
                 Software Product | Consulting Service |  Hardware  Product  |
                 Communications  Product | Professional Service | Managed Ser-
                 vice | Value-Added Resale Amazon Web Services Service |  Dis-
                 tribution Service | Training Service | Merger and Acquisition
                 Advising Service .

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 Indicates the solution creation date. This is useful to track
                 and audit.

              Id -> (string)
                 Enables  the association of solutions (offerings) to opportu-
                 nities.

              Name -> (string)
                 Specifies the solution name.

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies the solution's current status, which indicates  its
                 state  in the system. Valid values: Active | Inactive | Draft
                 . The status helps partners and Amazon Web Services track the
                 solution's  lifecycle and availability. Filter for Active so-
                 lutions for association to an opportunity.
