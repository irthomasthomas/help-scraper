OPTIONS
       --aws-submission (structure)
          Indicates  the  level  of  AWS  involvement in the opportunity. This
          field helps track AWS participation throughout the engagement,  such
          as providing technical support, deal assistance, and sales support.

          InvolvementType -> (string)
              Specifies  the  type of AWS involvement in the opportunity, such
              as coselling, deal  support,  or  technical  consultation.  This
              helps categorize the nature of AWS participation.

          Visibility -> (string)
              Determines who can view AWS involvement in the opportunity. Typ-
              ically, this field is set to Full for most cases, but it may  be
              restricted  based  on  special program requirements or confiden-
              tiality needs.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InvolvementType=string,Visibility=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InvolvementType": "For Visibility Only"|"Co-Sell",
            "Visibility": "Full"|"Limited"
          }

       --catalog (string)
          Specifies the catalog in which the engagement is tracked. Acceptable
          values  include  AWS for production and Sandbox for testing environ-
          ments.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique token provided by the client to help ensure the idempotency
          of  the request. It helps prevent the same task from being performed
          multiple times.

       --identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the opportunity from which  the  engagement
          task  is to be initiated. This helps ensure that the task is applied
          to the correct opportunity.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
