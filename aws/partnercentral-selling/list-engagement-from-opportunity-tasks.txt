NAME
       list-engagement-from-opportunity-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  in-progress, completed, or failed EngagementFromOpportunity
       tasks that were initiated by the caller's account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-engagement-from-opportunity-tasks is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  ar-
       gument.   When  using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: TaskSummaries

OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          Specifies the catalog related to the request. Valid values are:

          o AWS: Retrieves the request from the production AWS environment.

          o Sandbox: Retrieves the request from a sandbox environment used for
            testing or development purposes.

       --engagement-identifier (list)
          Filters tasks by the identifiers of the engagements they created  or
          are associated with.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --opportunity-identifier (list)
          The  identifier  of  the  original  opportunity associated with this
          task.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --sort (structure)
          Specifies the sorting criteria for the returned results. This allows
          you to order the tasks based on specific attributes.

          SortBy -> (string)
              Specifies the field by which the task list should be sorted.

          SortOrder -> (string)
              Determines the order in which the sorted results are presented.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SortBy=string,SortOrder=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SortBy": "StartTime",
            "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
          }

       --task-identifier (list)
          Filters tasks by their unique identifiers. Use this when you want to
          retrieve information about specific tasks.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --task-status (list)
          Filters the tasks based on their current status. This allows you  to
          focus on tasks in specific states.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            IN_PROGRESS
            COMPLETE
            FAILED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A token used for pagination to retrieve the next page of results. If
          there  are  more  results available, this field will contain a token
          that can be used in a subsequent API call to retrieve the next page.

                 A detailed message providing additional information about the
                 task,  especially  useful in case of failures. This field may
                 contain error details or other relevant information about the
                 task's execution

              OpportunityId -> (string)

                 A  code  indicating  the  specific reason for a task failure.
                 This field is populated when the task status  is  FAILED  and
