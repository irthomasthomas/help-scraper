ASSIGN-OPPORTUNITY()                                      ASSIGN-OPPORTUNITY()



NAME
       assign-opportunity -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  you to reassign an existing Opportunity to another user within
       your Partner Central account. The specified user receives the  opportu-
       nity,  and it appears on their Partner Central dashboard, allowing them
       to take necessary actions or proceed with the opportunity.

       This is useful for distributing opportunities to the  appropriate  team
       members or departments within your organization, ensuring that each op-
       portunity is handled by the right person. By default,  the  opportunity
       owner is the one who creates it. Currently, there's no API to enumerate
       the list of available users.

OPTIONS
       --assignee (structure)
          Specifies the user or team member responsible for managing  the  as-
          signed  opportunity. This field identifies the Assignee based on the
          partner's internal team structure. Ensure that the email address  is
          associated with a registered user in your Partner Central account.

          BusinessTitle -> (string)
              Specifies the business title of the assignee managing the oppor-
              tunity. This helps clarify the individual's role  and  responsi-
              bilities  within the organization. Use the value PartnerAccount-
              Manager to update details of the opportunity owner.

          Email -> (string)
              Provides the email address of the assignee. This email  is  used
              for communications and notifications related to the opportunity.

          FirstName -> (string)
              Specifies  the  first name of the assignee managing the opportu-
              nity. The system automatically retrieves  this  value  from  the
              user profile by referencing the associated email address.

          LastName -> (string)
              Specifies  the  last  name of the assignee managing the opportu-
              nity. The system automatically retrieves  this  value  from  the
              user profile by referencing the associated email address.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BusinessTitle=string,Email=string,FirstName=string,LastName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BusinessTitle": "string",
            "Email": "string",
            "FirstName": "string",
            "LastName": "string"
          }

       --catalog (string)
          Specifies  the catalog associated with the request. This field takes
          a string value from a predefined list: AWS or Sandbox . The  catalog
          determines which environment the opportunity is assigned in. Use AWS
          to assign real opportunities in the Amazon Web Services catalog, and
          Sandbox for testing in secure, isolated environments.

       --identifier (string)
          Requires  the  Opportunity 's unique identifier when you want to as-
          sign it to another user. Provide the correct identifier so  the  in-
          tended opportunity is reassigned.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
