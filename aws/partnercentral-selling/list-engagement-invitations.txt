LIST-ENGAGEMENT-INVITATIONS()                    LIST-ENGAGEMENT-INVITATIONS()



NAME
       list-engagement-invitations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of engagement invitations sent to the partner. This
       allows partners to view all pending  or  past  engagement  invitations,
       helping them track opportunities shared by AWS.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-engagement-invitations  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: EngagementInvitationSummaries

          Specifies the sorting options for  listing  engagement  invitations.
          Invitations can be sorted by fields such as InvitationDate or Status
          to help partners view results in their preferred order.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          An  array  containing summaries of engagement invitations. Each sum-
          mary includes information such as the invitation  title,  invitation
          date, and the current status of the invitation.

          (structure)
              Provides a summarized view of the Engagement Invitation, includ-
              ing details like the identifier, status, and sender.  This  sum-
              mary  helps  partners track and manage AWS originated opportuni-
              ties.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Engagement  Invitation.
                 The ARN is a unique identifier that allows partners to refer-
                 ence the invitation in their system and manage its lifecycle.

              Catalog -> (string)
                 Specifies the catalog in which the Engagement Invitation  re-
                 sides.  This  can be either the AWS or Sandbox catalog, indi-
                 cating whether the opportunity is live or being tested.

              EngagementId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Engagement associated with this invita-
                 tion. This links the invitation to its parent Engagement.

              ExpirationDate -> (timestamp)
                 Indicates  the  date  and time when the Engagement Invitation
                 will expire. After this date, the invitation can no longer be
                 accepted,  and  the  opportunity  will  be unavailable to the
                 partner.

              Id -> (string)
                 Represents the unique identifier of  the  Engagement  Invita-
                 tion.  This identifier is used to track the invitation and to
                 manage responses like acceptance or rejection.

              InvitationDate -> (timestamp)
                 Indicates the date when the Engagement Invitation was sent to
                 the  partner.  This provides context for when the opportunity
                 was shared and helps in tracking the timeline for engagement.

              ParticipantType -> (string)
                 Identifies the role of the caller in the  engagement  invita-
                 tion.

                 Describes  the type of payload associated with the Engagement
                 Invitation, such as Opportunity or  MarketplaceOffer  .  This
                 helps  partners  understand  the nature of the engagement re-
                 quest from AWS.

              Receiver -> (tagged union structure)
                 Specifies the partner company or individual that received the
                 Engagement  Invitation.  This field is important for tracking
                 who the invitation was sent to within the  partner  organiza-
                 tion.

                 NOTE:
                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
                     ing top level keys can be set: Account.

                 Account -> (structure)
                     Specifies the AWS account of the partner who received the
                     Engagement  Invitation.  This  field is used to track the
                     invitation recipient within the AWS ecosystem.

                     Alias -> (string)
                        Represents the alias of the partner account  receiving
                        the  Engagement  Invitation, making it easier to iden-
                        tify and track the recipient in reports or logs.

                     AwsAccountId -> (string)
                        Indicates the AWS account ID of the  partner  who  re-
                        ceived  the  Engagement  Invitation.  This is a unique

                        accounts.

              SenderAwsAccountId -> (string)
                 Specifies  the AWS account ID of the sender who initiated the
                 Engagement Invitation. This allows the  partner  to  identify

                 opportunity.

              SenderCompanyName -> (string)
                 Indicates the name of the company or AWS division  that  sent
                 the  Engagement  Invitation.  This  information is useful for
                 partners to know which part of AWS is requesting engagement.

              Status -> (string)
                 Represents the current status of the  Engagement  Invitation,
                 such  as  Pending , Accepted , or Rejected . The status helps
                 track the progress and response to the invitation.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token returned when there are  more  results  available
          than  can  be  returned in a single call. Use this token to retrieve
          additional pages of engagement invitation summaries.
