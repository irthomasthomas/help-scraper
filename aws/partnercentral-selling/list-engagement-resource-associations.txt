NAME
       list-engagement-resource-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  associations  between  resources  and engagements where the
       caller is a member and has at least one snapshot in the engagement.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-engagement-resource-associations is a paginated operation.  Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  ar-
       gument.   When  using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of  the  following query expressions: EngagementResourceAssociationSum-
       maries

OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          Specifies the catalog in which to search for engagement-resource as-
          sociations.

       --created-by (string)
          Filters  the  results  to  include  only associations with resources
          owned by the specified AWS account. Use this when you want  to  find
          associations related to resources owned by a particular account.

       --engagement-identifier (string)
          Filters  the  results  to  include  only associations related to the
          specified engagement. Use this when you want to find  all  resources
          associated with a specific engagement.

       --resource-identifier (string)
          Filters  the results to include only associations with the specified
          resource. Varies depending on the resource type. Use this  when  you
          want to find all engagements associated with a specific resource.

       --resource-type (string)
          Filters  the  results to include only associations with resources of
          the specified type.

          Possible values:

          o Opportunity

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EngagementResourceAssociationSummaries -> (list)
          A list of engagement-resource association summaries.

          (structure)
              This provide a streamlined view of the relationships between en-
              gagements and resources. These summaries offer  a  crucial  link
              between collaborative engagements and the specific resources in-
              volved, such as opportunities.These summaries  are  particularly
              valuable for partners navigating complex engagements with multi-
              ple resources. They enable quick insights into resource  distri-
              bution  across  engagements,  support efficient resource manage-
              ment, and help maintain a clear overview of collaborative activ-
              ities.

              Catalog -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  environment in which the resource and engage-
                 ment exist.

              CreatedBy -> (string)
                 The AWS account ID of the entity that  created  the  associa-
                 tion.

              EngagementId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  for the engagement associated with the
                 resource.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the specific resource. Varies depend-
                 ing on the resource type.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 Categorizes  the type of resource associated with the engage-
                 ment.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token to retrieve the next set of results. Use  this  token  in  a
          subsequent  request  to  retrieve additional results if the response
          was truncated.
