NAME
       list-engagement-by-accepting-invitation-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all in-progress, completed, or failed StartEngagementByAccepting-
       InvitationTask tasks that were initiated by the caller's account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-engagement-by-accepting-invitation-tasks is a paginated operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults of the following query expressions: TaskSummaries

          o Sandbox: Retrieves the request from a sandbox environment used for
            testing or development purposes.

       --engagement-invitation-identifier (list)
          Filters tasks by the identifiers of the engagement invitations  they
          are processing.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --opportunity-identifier (list)
          Filters  tasks  by the identifiers of the opportunities they created
          or are associated with.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --sort (structure)
          Specifies the sorting criteria for the returned results. This allows
          you to order the tasks based on specific attributes.

          SortBy -> (string)
              Specifies the field by which the task list should be sorted.

          SortOrder -> (string)
              Determines the order in which the sorted results are presented.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SortBy=string,SortOrder=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SortBy": "StartTime",
            "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
          }

       --task-identifier (list)
          Filters tasks by their unique identifiers. Use this when you want to
          retrieve information about specific tasks.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --task-status (list)
          Filters the tasks based on their current status. This allows you  to
          focus on tasks in specific states.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            IN_PROGRESS
            COMPLETE
            FAILED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A token used for pagination to retrieve the next page of  results.If
          there  are  more  results available, this field will contain a token
          that can be used in a subsequent API call to retrieve the next page.
          If  there  are  no more results, this field will be null or an empty
          string.

                 accepted.

              Message -> (string)
                 Detailed message describing the failure and possible recovery
