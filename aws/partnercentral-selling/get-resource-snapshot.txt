OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          Specifies the catalog related to the request. Valid values are:

          o AWS: Retrieves the snapshot from the production AWS environment.

          o Sandbox:  Retrieves  the  snapshot from a sandbox environment used
            for testing or development purposes.

       --engagement-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the engagement associated  with  the  snap-
          shot.  This  field  links the snapshot to a specific engagement con-
          text.

       --resource-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the specific resource that was snapshotted.
          The  format  and  constraints  of  this identifier depend on the Re-
          sourceType specified. For Opportunity type, it will be  an  opportu-
          nity ID

       --resource-snapshot-template-identifier (string)
          he  name  of  the template that defines the schema for the snapshot.
          This template determines which subset of the resource  data  is  in-
          cluded  in the snapshot and must correspond to an existing and valid
          template for the specified ResourceType .

       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies the type of resource that was snapshotted. This field  de-
          termines  the  structure  and content of the snapshot payload. Valid
          value includes:Opportunity : For opportunity-related data.

          Possible values:

          o Opportunity

       --revision (integer)
          Specifies which revision of the snapshot to retrieve. If omitted re-
          turns the latest revision.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
