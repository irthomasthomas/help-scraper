OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          An optional description for the tracker resource.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          A key identifier for an Amazon Web Services KMS customer managed key
          . Enter a key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN.

       --position-filtering (string)
          Specifies the position filtering for the tracker resource.

          Valid values:

          o TimeBased - Location updates are evaluated against linked geofence
            collections, but not every location update is stored. If your  up-
            date  frequency is more often than 30 seconds, only one update per
            30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.

          o DistanceBased - If the device has moved less than 30 m (98.4  ft),
            location  updates  are  ignored. Location updates within this area
            are neither evaluated against  linked  geofence  collections,  nor
            stored.  This  helps  control  costs by reducing the number of ge-
            ofence evaluations and historical  device  positions  to  paginate
            through.  Distance-based  filtering can also reduce the effects of
            GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map.

          o AccuracyBased - If the device has moved less than the measured ac-
            curacy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two consecu-
            tive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5  m  and
            10  m,  the  second update is ignored if the device has moved less
            than 15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated  against
            linked  geofence  collections, nor stored. This can reduce the ef-
            fects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on  a  map,
            and can help control your costs by reducing the number of geofence
            evaluations.

          This field is optional. If not specified, the default value is Time-
          Based .

          Possible values:

          o TimeBased

          o DistanceBased

          o AccuracyBased

       --pricing-plan (string)
          No  longer used. If included, the only allowed value is RequestBase-
          dUsage .

          Possible values:

          o RequestBasedUsage

          o MobileAssetTracking

          o MobileAssetManagement

       --pricing-plan-data-source (string)
          This parameter is no longer used.

       --tags (map)
          Applies one or more tags  to  the  tracker  resource.  A  tag  is  a
          key-value  pair  helps manage, identify, search, and filter your re-
          sources by labelling them.

          Format: "key" : "value"

          Restrictions:

          o Maximum 50 tags per resource

          o Each resource tag must be unique with a maximum of one value.

          o Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Can use alphanumeric characters (AZ, az, 09),  and  the  following
            characters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Cannot use "aws:" as a prefix for a key.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --tracker-name (string)
          The name for the tracker resource.

          Requirements:

          o Contain  only  alphanumeric  characters  (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) , hyphens
            (-), periods (.), and underscores (_).

          o Must be a unique tracker resource name.

          o No spaces allowed. For example, ExampleTracker .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          The  timestamp for when the tracker resource was created in ISO 8601
          format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

       TrackerArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the tracker resource.  Used  when
          you need to specify a resource across all Amazon Web Services.
