OPTIONS
       --tracker-name (string)
          The name for the tracker resource.

          Requirements:

          o Contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z,  a-z,  0-9)  ,  hyphens
            (-), periods (.), and underscores (_).

          o Must be a unique tracker resource name.

          o No spaces allowed. For example, ExampleTracker .

       --pricing-plan (string)
          No  longer used. If included, the only allowed value is RequestBase-
          dUsage .

          Possible values:

          o RequestBasedUsage

          o MobileAssetTracking

          o MobileAssetManagement

       --kms-key-id (string)
          A key identifier for an Amazon Web Services KMS customer managed key
          . Enter a key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN.

       --pricing-plan-data-source (string)
          This parameter is no longer used.

       --description (string)
          An optional description for the tracker resource.

       --tags (map)
          Applies  one  or  more  tags  to  the  tracker  resource. A tag is a
          key-value pair helps manage, identify, search, and filter  your  re-
          sources by labelling them.

          Format: "key" : "value"

          Restrictions:

          o Maximum 50 tags per resource

          o Each resource tag must be unique with a maximum of one value.

          o Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Can  use  alphanumeric  characters (AZ, az, 09), and the following
            characters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Cannot use "aws:" as a prefix for a key.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --position-filtering (string)
          Specifies the position filtering for the tracker resource.

          Valid values:

          o TimeBased - Location updates are evaluated against linked geofence
            collections,  but not every location update is stored. If your up-
            date frequency is more often than 30 seconds, only one update  per
            30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.

          o DistanceBased  - If the device has moved less than 30 m (98.4 ft),
            location updates are ignored. Location updates  within  this  area
            are  neither  evaluated  against  linked geofence collections, nor
            stored. This helps control costs by reducing  the  number  of  ge-
            ofence  evaluations  and  historical  device positions to paginate
            through. Distance-based filtering can also reduce the  effects  of
            GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map.

          o AccuracyBased - If the device has moved less than the measured ac-
            curacy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two consecu-
            tive  updates  from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m and
            10 m, the second update is ignored if the device  has  moved  less
            than  15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated against
            linked geofence collections, nor stored. This can reduce  the  ef-
            fects  of  GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map,
            and can help control your costs by reducing the number of geofence
            evaluations.

          This field is optional. If not specified, the default value is Time-
          Based .

          Possible values:

          o TimeBased

          o DistanceBased

          o AccuracyBased

       --event-bridge-enabled | --no-event-bridge-enabled (boolean)
          Whether to enable position UPDATE events from  this  tracker  to  be
          sent to EventBridge.

          NOTE:
              You do not need enable this feature to get ENTER and EXIT events
              for geofences with this tracker. Those events are always sent to
              EventBridge.

       --kms-key-enable-geospatial-queries    |    --no-kms-key-enable-geospa-
       tial-queries (boolean)
          Enables GeospatialQueries for a tracker that uses a Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices KMS customer managed key .

          This  parameter is only used if you are using a KMS customer managed
          key.

          NOTE:
              If you wish to encrypt your data using  your  own  KMS  customer
              managed  key,  then the Bounding Polygon Queries feature will be
              disabled by default. This is because by using  this  feature,  a
              representation  of  your  device positions will not be encrypted
              using the your KMS managed key. The exact device position,  how-
              ever; is still encrypted using your managed key.

              You  can  choose to opt-in to the Bounding Polygon Quseries fea-
              ture. This is done by setting the  KmsKeyEnableGeospatialQueries
              parameter to true when creating or updating a Tracker.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TrackerName -> (string)
          The name of the tracker resource.

       TrackerArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for the tracker resource. Used when
          you need to specify a resource across all Amazon Web Services.
