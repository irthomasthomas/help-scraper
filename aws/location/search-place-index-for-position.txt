OPTIONS
       --index-name (string)
          The name of the place index resource you want to use for the search.

       --language (string)
          The  preferred  language used to return results. The value must be a
          valid BCP 47 language tag, for example, en for English.

          This setting affects the languages used in the results, but not  the
          results  themselves.  If  no language is specified, or not supported
          for a particular result, the partner automatically  chooses  a  lan-
          guage for the result.

          For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for a loca-
          tion around Athens, Greece, with the language parameter set to en  .
          The city in the results will most likely be returned as Athens .

          If  you  set the language parameter to el , for Greek, then the city
          in the results will more likely be returned as  .

          If the data provider does not have a value  for  Greek,  the  result
          will be in a language that the provider does support.

       --max-results (integer)
          An  optional  parameter.  The maximum number of results returned per
          request.

          Default value: 50

       --position (list)
          Specifies the longitude and latitude of the position to query.

          This parameter must contain a pair of numbers. The first number rep-
          resents the X coordinate, or longitude; the second number represents
          the Y coordinate, or latitude.

          For example, [-123.1174, 49.2847] represents a position with  longi-
          tude -123.1174 and latitude 49.2847 .

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Results -> (list)
          Returns a list of Places closest to the specified position. Each re-
          sult contains additional information about the Places returned.

          (structure)
              Contains  a  search  result from a position search query that is
              run on a place index resource.

                 The distance in meters of  a  great-circle  arc  between  the
                 query position and the result.

                 NOTE:
                     A  great-circle  arc is the shortest path on a sphere, in
                     this case the Earth. This returns the  shortest  distance
                     between two locations.

              Place -> (structure)
                 Details  about the search result, such as its address and po-
                 sition.

                 AddressNumber -> (string)
                     The numerical portion of an address, such as  a  building

                     try/region code. For example, CAN .

                 Geometry -> (structure)
                     Places uses a point geometry to specify a location  or  a
                     Place.

                     Point -> (list)
                        A  single  point  geometry  specifies a location for a
                        Place using WGS 84 coordinates:

                        o x  Specifies the x coordinate or longitude.

                        o y  Specifies the y coordinate or latitude.

                        (double)

                     is  found in the partner data, but returns True if an ad-
                     dress does not exist in the partner data and its location
                     is  calculated  by  interpolating between other known ad-
                     dresses.

                 Label -> (string)
