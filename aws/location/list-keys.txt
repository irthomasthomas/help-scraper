LIST-KEYS()                                                        LIST-KEYS()



NAME
       list-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists API key resources in your Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-keys is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Entries

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Optionally filter the list to only Active or Expired API keys.

          KeyStatus -> (string)
              Filter on Active or Expired API keys.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyStatus=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KeyStatus": "Active"|"Expired"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Entries -> (list)
          Contains  API key resources in your Amazon Web Services account. De-
          tails include API key name, allowed referers and timestamp for  when
          the API key will expire.

          (structure)
              An API key resource listed in your Amazon Web Services account.

              KeyName -> (string)
                 The name of the API key resource.

              ExpireTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  for when the API key resource will expire, in
                 ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

              Description -> (string)
                 The optional description for the API key resource.

              Restrictions -> (structure)
                 API Restrictions on the allowed actions, resources, and  ref-
                 erers for an API key resource.

                 AllowActions -> (list)
                     A list of allowed actions that an API key resource grants
                     permissions to perform. You must have at least one action
                     for  each  type  of  resource. For example, if you have a
                     place resource, you must include at least one  place  ac-
                     tion.

                     The following are valid values for the actions.

                     o Map actions

                       o geo:GetMap*  - Allows all actions needed for map ren-
                         dering.

                     o Place actions

                       o geo:SearchPlaceIndexForText - Allows geocoding.

                       o geo:SearchPlaceIndexForPosition  -   Allows   reverse
                         geocoding.

                       o geo:SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions  - Allows generat-
                         ing suggestions from text.

                       o GetPlace - Allows finding a place by place ID.

                     o Route actions

                       o geo:CalculateRoute - Allows point to point routing.

                       o geo:CalculateRouteMatrix - Allows calculating  a  ma-
                         trix of routes.

                     NOTE:
                        You  must  use  these strings exactly. For example, to
                        provide access to map rendering, the only valid action
                        is    geo:GetMap*   as   an   input   to   the   list.
                        ["geo:GetMap*"] is  valid  but  ["geo:GetMapTile"]  is
                        not. Similarly, you cannot use ["geo:SearchPlaceIndex-
                        For*"] - you must list each of the Place actions sepa-
                        rately.

                     (string)

                 AllowResources -> (list)
                     A list of allowed resource ARNs that a API key bearer can
                     perform actions on.

                     o The ARN must be the correct ARN for a  map,  place,  or
                       route ARN. You may include wildcards in the resource-id
                       to match multiple resources of the same type.

                     o The resources must be in the same partition , region  ,
                       and account-id as the key that is being created.

                     o Other  than  wildcards,  you must include the full ARN,
                       including the arn , partition , service , region ,  ac-
                       count-id and resource-id delimited by colons (:).

                     o No  spaces  allowed,  even with wildcards. For example,
                       arn:aws:geo:region:*account-id* :map/ExampleMap* .

                     For more information about ARN  format,  see  Amazon  Re-
                     source Names (ARNs) .

                     (string)

                 AllowReferers -> (list)
                     An  optional  list of allowed HTTP referers for which re-
                     quests must originate from. Requests using this  API  key
                     from other domains will not be allowed.

                     Requirements:

                     o Contain  only  alphanumeric  characters (AZ, az, 09) or
                       any symbols in this list $\-._+!*`(),;/?:@=&

                     o May contain a percent (%) if followed by 2  hexadecimal
                       digits  (A-F,  a-f, 0-9); this is used for URL encoding
                       purposes.

                     o May contain wildcard characters question mark  (?)  and
                       asterisk (*). Question mark (?) will replace any single
                       character (including hexadecimal digits). Asterisk  (*)
                       will  replace any multiple characters (including multi-
                       ple hexadecimal digits).

                     o No spaces allowed. For example, https://example.com .

                     (string)

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of when the API key was created,  in  ISO  8601
                 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

              UpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  of  when the API key was last updated, in ISO
                 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token indicating there are additional pages  available.
          You  can  use the token in a following request to fetch the next set
          of results.



                                                                   LIST-KEYS()
