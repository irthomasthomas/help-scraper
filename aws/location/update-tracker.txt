OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          Updates the description for the tracker resource.

       --position-filtering (string)
          Updates the position filtering for the tracker resource.

          Valid values:

          o TimeBased - Location updates are evaluated against linked geofence
            collections, but not every location update is stored. If your  up-
            date  frequency is more often than 30 seconds, only one update per
            30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.

          o DistanceBased - If the device has moved less than 30 m (98.4  ft),
            location  updates  are  ignored. Location updates within this dis-
            tance are neither evaluated against linked  geofence  collections,
            nor stored. This helps control costs by reducing the number of ge-
            ofence evaluations and historical  device  positions  to  paginate
            through.  Distance-based  filtering can also reduce the effects of
            GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map.

          o AccuracyBased - If the device has moved less than the measured ac-
            curacy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two consecu-
            tive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5  m  and
            10  m,  the  second update is ignored if the device has moved less
            than 15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated  against
            linked  geofence collections, nor stored. This helps educe the ef-
            fects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on  a  map,
            and  can  help  control  costs  by reducing the number of geofence
            evaluations.

          Possible values:

          o TimeBased

          o DistanceBased

          o AccuracyBased

       --pricing-plan (string)
          No longer used. If included, the only allowed value is  RequestBase-
          dUsage .

          Possible values:

          o RequestBasedUsage

          o MobileAssetTracking

          o MobileAssetManagement

       --pricing-plan-data-source (string)
          This parameter is no longer used.

       --tracker-name (string)
          The name of the tracker resource to update.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TrackerArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the updated tracker resource. Used
          to specify a resource across AWS.

          o Format   example:   arn:aws:geo:region:account-id:tracker/Example-
            Tracker

       TrackerName -> (string)
          The name of the updated tracker resource.

       UpdateTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp for when the tracker resource was last updated in  ISO
          8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .
