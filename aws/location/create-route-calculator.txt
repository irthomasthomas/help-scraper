CREATE-ROUTE-CALCULATOR()                            CREATE-ROUTE-CALCULATOR()



NAME
       create-route-calculator -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a route calculator resource in your AWS account.

       You can send requests to a route calculator resource to estimate travel
       time, distance, and get directions. A route calculator sources  traffic
       and road network data from your chosen data provider.

       NOTE:
          If  your  application  is tracking or routing assets you use in your
          business, such as delivery vehicles or employees, you must  not  use
          Esri as your geolocation provider. See section 82 of the AWS service
          terms for more details.

OPTIONS
       --calculator-name (string)
          The name of the route calculator resource.

          Requirements:

          o Can use alphanumeric characters (AZ, az, 09) , hyphens (-),  peri-
            ods (.), and underscores (_).

          o Must be a unique Route calculator resource name.

          o No spaces allowed. For example, ExampleRouteCalculator .

       --data-source (string)
          Specifies the data provider of traffic and road network data.

          NOTE:
              This  field  is case-sensitive. Enter the valid values as shown.
              For example, entering HERE returns an error.

          Valid values include:

          o Esri  For additional information about Esri 's  coverage  in  your
            region  of interest, see Esri details on street networks and traf-
            fic coverage . Route calculators that use Esri as  a  data  source
            only calculate routes that are shorter than 400 km.

          o Grab   Grab provides routing functionality for Southeast Asia. For
            additional information about GrabMaps  '  coverage,  see  GrabMaps
            countries and areas covered .

          o Here   For additional information about HERE Technologies ' cover-
            age in your region of interest, see HERE car routing coverage  and
            HERE truck routing coverage .

          For  additional information , see Data providers on the Amazon Loca-
          tion Service Developer Guide .

       --description (string)
          The optional description for the route calculator resource.

       --pricing-plan (string)
          No longer used. If included, the only allowed value is  RequestBase-
          dUsage .

          Possible values:

          o RequestBasedUsage

          o MobileAssetTracking

          o MobileAssetManagement

       --tags (map)
          Applies  one or more tags to the route calculator resource. A tag is
          a key-value pair helps manage, identify, search, and filter your re-
          sources by labelling them.

          o For example: { "tag1" : "value1" , "tag2" : "value2" }

          Format: "key" : "value"

          Restrictions:

          o Maximum 50 tags per resource

          o Each resource tag must be unique with a maximum of one value.

          o Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Can  use  alphanumeric  characters (AZ, az, 09), and the following
            characters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Cannot use "aws:" as a prefix for a key.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
