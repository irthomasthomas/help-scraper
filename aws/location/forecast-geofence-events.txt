FORECAST-GEOFENCE-EVENTS()                          FORECAST-GEOFENCE-EVENTS()



NAME
       forecast-geofence-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Evaluates device positions against geofence geometries from a given ge-
       ofence collection. The event forecasts three states for which a  device
       can be in relative to a geofence:
          ENTER  :  If a device is outside of a geofence, but would breach the
          fence if the device is moving at its current speed within time hori-
          zon window.

          EXIT  :  If  a  device is inside of a geofence, but would breach the
          fence if the device is moving at its current speed within time hori-
          zon window.

          IDLE  :  If  a device is inside of a geofence, and the device is not
          moving.

       forecast-geofence-events is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ForecastedEvents

OPTIONS
       --collection-name (string)
          The name of the geofence collection.

       --device-state (structure)
          The device's state, including current position and speed.

          Position -> (list)
              The device's position.

              (double)

          Speed -> (double)
              The device's speed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Position=double,double,Speed=double

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Position": [double, ...],
            "Speed": double
          }

       --time-horizon-minutes (double)
          Specifies the time horizon in minutes for the forecasted events.

       --distance-unit (string)
          The  distance unit used for the NearestDistance property returned in
          a forecasted event. The measurement system must match for DistanceU-
          nit  and  SpeedUnit  ; if Kilometers is specified for DistanceUnit ,
          then SpeedUnit must be KilometersPerHour .

          Default Value: Kilometers

          Possible values:

          o Kilometers

          o Miles

       --speed-unit (string)
          The speed unit for the device captured by the device state. The mea-
          surement system must match for DistanceUnit and SpeedUnit ; if Kilo-
          meters is specified for DistanceUnit , then SpeedUnit must be  Kilo-
          metersPerHour .

          Default Value: KilometersPerHour .

          Possible values:

          o KilometersPerHour

          o MilesPerHour

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
