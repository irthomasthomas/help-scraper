BATCH-EVALUATE-GEOFENCES()                          BATCH-EVALUATE-GEOFENCES()



NAME
       batch-evaluate-geofences -

DESCRIPTION
       Evaluates device positions against the geofence geometries from a given
       geofence collection.

       This operation always returns an empty response because  geofences  are
       asynchronously  evaluated.  The evaluation determines if the device has
       entered or exited a geofenced area, and then publishes one of the  fol-
       lowing events to Amazon EventBridge:

       o ENTER  if  Amazon Location determines that the tracked device has en-
         tered a geofenced area.

       o EXIT if Amazon Location determines that the tracked device has exited
         a geofenced area.

       NOTE:
          The  last  geofence that a device was observed within is tracked for
          30 days after the most recent device position update.

       NOTE:
          Geofence evaluation uses the given device position. It does not  ac-
          count for the optional Accuracy of a DevicePositionUpdate .

       NOTE:
          The DeviceID is used as a string to represent the device. You do not
          need to have a Tracker associated with the DeviceID .

OPTIONS
       --collection-name (string)
          The geofence collection used in evaluating the position  of  devices
          against its geofences.

       --device-position-updates (list)
          Contains  device details for each device to be evaluated against the
          given geofence collection.

          (structure)
              Contains the position update details for a device.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The device associated to the position update.

              SampleTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp at which the device's position was  determined.
                 Uses ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ

              Position -> (list)
                 The  latest  device  position defined in WGS 84 format: [X or
                 longitude, Y or latitude] .

                 (double)

              Accuracy -> (structure)
                 The accuracy of the device position.

                 Horizontal -> (double)
                     Estimated maximum distance, in meters, between  the  mea-
                     sured  position  and the true position of a device, along
                     the Earth's surface.

              PositionProperties -> (map)
                 Associates one of more properties with the position update. A
                 property  is a key-value pair stored with the position update
                 and added to any geofence event the update may trigger.

                 Format: "key" : "value"

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DeviceId=string,SampleTime=timestamp,Position=double,double,Accuracy={Horizontal=double},PositionProperties={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DeviceId": "string",
              "SampleTime": timestamp,
              "Position": [double, ...],
              "Accuracy": {
                "Horizontal": double
              },
              "PositionProperties": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
