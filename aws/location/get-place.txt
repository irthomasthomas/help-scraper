OPTIONS
       --index-name (string)
          The  name  of  the place index resource that you want to use for the
          search.

       --key (string)
          The optional API key to authorize the request.

       --language (string)
          The preferred language used to return results. The value must  be  a
          valid BCP 47 language tag, for example, en for English.

          This  setting affects the languages used in the results, but not the
          results themselves. If no language is specified,  or  not  supported
          for  a  particular  result, the partner automatically chooses a lan-
          guage for the result.

          For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for a loca-
          tion  around Athens, Greece, with the language parameter set to en .
          The city in the results will most likely be returned as Athens .

          If you set the language parameter to el , for Greek, then  the  city
          in the results will more likely be returned as  .

          If  the  data  provider  does not have a value for Greek, the result
          will be in a language that the provider does support.

       --place-id (string)
          The identifier of the place to find.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
