OPTIONS
       --map-name (string)
          The name of the map resource.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

                high  contrast  detailed  base map of the world that blends 3D

                 The VectorHereContrast  style  has  been  renamed  from  Vec-
                 torHereBerlin  .  VectorHereBerlin  has  been deprecated, but
                 will continue to work in applications that use it.

                tral,  global map and its features including roads, buildings,

                This  style will automatically retrieve both raster and vector
                tiles, and your charges will  be  based  on  total  tiles  re-
                trieved.

              NOTE:
                 Hybrid styles use both vector and raster tiles when rendering
                 the map that you see. This means  that  more  tiles  are  re-
                 trieved  than when using either vector or raster tiles alone.
                 Your charges will include all tiles retrieved.
