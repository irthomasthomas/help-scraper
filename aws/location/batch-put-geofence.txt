       A  batch  request for storing geofence geometries into a given geofence
       collection, or updates the geometry of an existing geofence  if  a  ge-
       ofence ID is included in the request.

OPTIONS
       --collection-name (string)
          The geofence collection storing the geofences.

       --entries (list)
          The batch of geofences to be stored in a geofence collection.

          (structure)
              Contains geofence geometry details.

              GeofenceId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for the geofence to be stored in a given ge-
                 ofence collection.

              Geometry -> (structure)
                 Contains the details of the position of the geofence. Can  be
                 either  a  polygon  or a circle. Including both will return a
                 validation error.

                 NOTE:
                     Each geofence polygon can have a maximum  of  1,000  ver-
                     tices.

                 Circle -> (structure)
                     A circle on the earth, as defined by a center point and a
                     radius.

                     Center -> (list)
                        A single point geometry, specifying the center of  the
                        circle,  using WGS 84 coordinates, in the form [longi-
                        tude, latitude] .

                        (double)

                     Radius -> (double)
                        The radius of the circle in meters.  Must  be  greater
                        than zero and no larger than 100,000 (100 kilometers).

                 Polygon -> (list)
                     An  array  of 1 or more linear rings. A linear ring is an
                     array of 4 or more vertices, where  the  first  and  last
                     vertex  are the same to form a closed boundary. Each ver-
                     tex is a 2-dimensional point  of  the  form:  [longitude,
                     latitude] .

                     The  first  linear  ring is an outer ring, describing the
                     polygon's boundary. Subsequent linear rings may be  inner
                     or outer rings to describe holes and islands. Outer rings
                     must  list  their  vertices  in  counter-clockwise  order
                     around  the  ring's  center,  where  the left side is the
                     polygon's exterior. Inner rings must list their  vertices
                     in  clockwise order, where the left side is the polygon's
                     interior.

                     A geofence polygon can consist of  between  4  and  1,000
                     vertices.

                     (list)
                        (list)
                            (double)

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "GeofenceId": "string",
              "Geometry": {
                "Circle": {
                  "Center": [double, ...],
                  "Radius": double
                },

              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
