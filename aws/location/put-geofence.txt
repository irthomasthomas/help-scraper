       Stores  a  geofence geometry in a given geofence collection, or updates
       the geometry of an existing geofence if a geofence ID  is  included  in
       the request.

OPTIONS
       --collection-name (string)
          The geofence collection to store the geofence in.

       --geofence-id (string)
          An identifier for the geofence. For example, ExampleGeofence-1 .

       --geometry (structure)
          Contains the details to specify the position of the geofence. Can be
          a polygon, a circle or a polygon encoded in Geobuf format. Including
          multiple selections will return a validation error.

          NOTE:
              The  geofence  polygon  format  supports a maximum of 1,000 ver-
              tices. The Geofence Geobuf format supports a maximum of  100,000
              vertices.

          Polygon -> (list)
              A  polygon is a list of linear rings which are each made up of a
              list of vertices.

              Each vertex is a 2-dimensional point of  the  form:  [longitude,
              latitude] . This is represented as an array of doubles of length
              2 (so [double, double] ).

              An array of 4 or more vertices, where the first and last  vertex
              are  the  same  (to  form a closed boundary), is called a linear
              ring. The linear ring vertices must be listed in  counter-clock-
              wise  order around the rings interior. The linear ring is repre-
              sented as an array of vertices, or an array of arrays of doubles
              ([[double, double], ...] ).

              A geofence consists of a single linear ring. To allow for future
              expansion, the Polygon parameter takes an array of linear rings,
              which  is represented as an array of arrays of arrays of doubles
              ([[[double, double], ...], ...] ).

              A linear ring for use in geofences can consist of between 4  and
              1,000 vertices.

              (list)
                 (list)
                     (double)

          Circle -> (structure)
              A  circle  on  the earth, as defined by a center point and a ra-
              dius.

              Center -> (list)
                 A single point geometry, specifying the center of the circle,
                 using WGS 84 coordinates, in the form [longitude, latitude] .

                 (double)

              Radius -> (double)
                 The radius of the circle in meters. Must be greater than zero
                 and no larger than 100,000 (100 kilometers).

          Geobuf -> (blob)
              Geobuf is a compact binary encoding  for  geographic  data  that
              provides  lossless  compression  of GeoJSON polygons. The Geobuf
              must be Base64-encoded.

              A polygon in Geobuf format can have up to 100,000 vertices.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Polygon": [
              [
                [double, ...]
                ...
              ]
              ...
            ],
            "Circle": {
              "Center": [double, ...],
              "Radius": double
            },
            "Geobuf": blob
          }

       --geofence-properties (map)
          Associates one of more properties with the geofence. A property is a
          key-value  pair  stored  with the geofence and added to any geofence
          event triggered with that geofence.

          Format: "key" : "value"

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          The geofence identifier entered in the request.

       CreateTime -> (timestamp)
          The  timestamp for when the geofence was created in ISO 8601 format:
