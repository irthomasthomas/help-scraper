NAME
       search-place-index-for-suggestions -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  suggestions  for  addresses  and points of interest based on
       partial or misspelled free-form text. This operation is also  known  as
       autocomplete, autosuggest, or fuzzy matching.

       Optional  parameters let you narrow your search results by bounding box
       or country, or bias your search  toward  a  specific  position  on  the
       globe.

       NOTE:
          You  can  search for suggested place names near a specified position
          by using BiasPosition , or filter results within a bounding  box  by
          using  FilterBBox  .  These parameters are mutually exclusive; using
          both BiasPosition and FilterBBox in the same command returns an  er-
          ror.

OPTIONS
       --bias-position (list)
          An  optional parameter that indicates a preference for place sugges-
          tions that are closer to a specified position.

          If provided, this parameter must contain  a  pair  of  numbers.  The
          first  number  represents the X coordinate, or longitude; the second
          number represents the Y coordinate, or latitude.

          For example, [-123.1174, 49.2847] represents the position with  lon-
          gitude -123.1174 and latitude 49.2847 .

          NOTE:
              BiasPosition  and  FilterBBox are mutually exclusive. Specifying
              both options results in an error.

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --filter-b-box (list)
          An optional parameter that limits the search  results  by  returning
          only suggestions within a specified bounding box.

          If provided, this parameter must contain a total of four consecutive
          numbers in two pairs. The first pair of numbers represents the X and
          Y  coordinates  (longitude and latitude, respectively) of the south-
          west corner of the bounding box; the second pair of  numbers  repre-
          sents the X and Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively)
          of the northeast corner of the bounding box.

          For example, [-12.7935, -37.4835, -12.0684, -36.9542]  represents  a
          bounding  box  where the southwest corner has longitude -12.7935 and
          latitude -37.4835 , and the northeast corner has longitude  -12.0684
          and latitude -36.9542 .

          NOTE:
              FilterBBox  and  BiasPosition are mutually exclusive. Specifying
              both options results in an error.

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --filter-categories (list)
          A list of one or more Amazon Location categories to filter  the  re-
          turned  places.  If  you include more than one category, the results
          will include results that match any of the categories listed.

          For more information about using categories,  including  a  list  of
          Amazon  Location  categories,  see Categories and filtering , in the
          Amazon Location Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filter-countries (list)
          An optional parameter that limits the search  results  by  returning
          only suggestions within the provided list of countries.

          o Use the ISO 3166 3-digit country code. For example, Australia uses
            three upper-case characters: AUS .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --index-name (string)
          The name of the place index resource you want to use for the search.

       --key (string)
          The optional API key to authorize the request.

       --language (string)
          The preferred language used to return results. The value must  be  a
          valid BCP 47 language tag, for example, en for English.

          This  setting  affects the languages used in the results. If no lan-
          guage is specified, or not supported for a  particular  result,  the
          partner automatically chooses a language for the result.

          For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for Athens,
          Gr to get suggestions with the language parameter set to  en  .  The
          results found will most likely be returned as Athens, Greece .

          If you set the language parameter to el , for Greek, then the result
          found will more likely be returned as ,  .

          If the data provider does not have a value  for  Greek,  the  result
          will be in a language that the provider does support.

       --max-results (integer)
          An  optional  parameter.  The maximum number of results returned per
          request.

          The default: 5

       --text (string)
          The free-form partial text to use to generate place suggestions. For
          example, eiffel tow .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          A list of place suggestions that best match the search text.

          (structure)

              query that is run on a place index resource.

              Categories -> (list)
                 The Amazon Location categories that describe the Place.

                 For more information about using categories, including a list

                 in the Amazon Location Service Developer Guide .

                 (string)

              PlaceId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the Place. You can use this with the

                 full information for the Place.

                 The GetPlace request must use the same PlaceIndex resource as
                 the SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions that generated  the  Place
                 ID.

                 NOTE:
                     For  SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions  operations, the Pla-

              resents the X coordinate, or longitude; the second number repre-
              sents the Y coordinate, or latitude.

              For example, [-123.1174, 49.2847] represents the  position  with
