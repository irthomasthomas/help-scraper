SEARCH-PLACE-INDEX-FOR-TEXT()                    SEARCH-PLACE-INDEX-FOR-TEXT()



NAME
       search-place-index-for-text -

DESCRIPTION
       Geocodes  free-form  text, such as an address, name, city, or region to
       allow you to search for Places or points of interest.

       Optional parameters let you narrow your search results by bounding  box
       or  country,  or  bias  your  search  toward a specific position on the
       globe.

       NOTE:
          You can search for places near a given position using BiasPosition ,
          or filter results within a bounding box using FilterBBox . Providing
          both parameters simultaneously returns an error.

       Search results are returned in order of highest to lowest relevance.

OPTIONS
       --index-name (string)
          The name of the place index resource you want to use for the search.

       --text (string)
          The address, name, city, or region to  be  used  in  the  search  in
          free-form text format. For example, 123 Any Street .

       --bias-position (list)
          An  optional  parameter  that indicates a preference for places that
          are closer to a specified position.

          If provided, this parameter must contain  a  pair  of  numbers.  The
          first  number  represents the X coordinate, or longitude; the second
          number represents the Y coordinate, or latitude.

          For example, [-123.1174, 49.2847] represents the position with  lon-
          gitude -123.1174 and latitude 49.2847 .

          NOTE:
              BiasPosition  and  FilterBBox are mutually exclusive. Specifying
              both options results in an error.

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --filter-b-box (list)
          An optional parameter that limits the search  results  by  returning
          only places that are within the provided bounding box.

          If provided, this parameter must contain a total of four consecutive
          numbers in two pairs. The first pair of numbers represents the X and
          Y  coordinates  (longitude and latitude, respectively) of the south-
          west corner of the bounding box; the second pair of  numbers  repre-
          sents the X and Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively)
          of the northeast corner of the bounding box.

          For example, [-12.7935, -37.4835, -12.0684, -36.9542]  represents  a
          bounding  box  where the southwest corner has longitude -12.7935 and
          latitude -37.4835 , and the northeast corner has longitude  -12.0684
          and latitude -36.9542 .

          NOTE:
              FilterBBox  and  BiasPosition are mutually exclusive. Specifying
              both options results in an error.

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --filter-countries (list)
          An optional parameter that limits the search  results  by  returning
          only places that are in a specified list of countries.

          o Valid  values include ISO 3166 3-digit country codes. For example,
            Australia uses three upper-case characters: AUS .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --max-results (integer)
          An optional parameter. The maximum number of  results  returned  per
          request.

          The default: 50

       --language (string)
          The  preferred  language used to return results. The value must be a
          valid BCP 47 language tag, for example, en for English.

          This setting affects the languages used in the results, but not  the
          results  themselves.  If  no language is specified, or not supported
          for a particular result, the partner automatically  chooses  a  lan-
          guage for the result.

          For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for Athens,
          Greece , with the language parameter set to en .  The  result  found
          will most likely be returned as Athens .

          If you set the language parameter to el , for Greek, then the result
          found will more likely be returned as  .

          If the data provider does not have a value  for  Greek,  the  result
          will be in a language that the provider does support.

       --filter-categories (list)
          A  list  of one or more Amazon Location categories to filter the re-
          turned places. If you include more than one  category,  the  results
          will include results that match any of the categories listed.

          For  more  information  about  using categories, including a list of
          Amazon Location categories, see Categories and filtering  ,  in  the
          Amazon Location Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --key (string)
          The optional API key to authorize the request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 The distance in meters of a great-circle arc between the bias
                 position  specified and the result. Distance will be returned
                 only if a bias position was specified in the query.

                 NOTE:
                     A great-circle arc is the shortest path on a  sphere,  in
                     this  case  the Earth. This returns the shortest distance
                     between two locations.

                 The relative confidence in the match for a result  among  the
                 results  returned. For example, if more fields for an address
                 match (including house number, street, city,  country/region,
                 and postal code), the relevance score is closer to 1.

                 Returned only when the partner selected is Esri or Grab.

              PlaceId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the place. You can use this with the
                 GetPlace operation to find the place again later.

                 NOTE:
                     For SearchPlaceIndexForText operations,  the  PlaceId  is
                     returned only by place indexes that use HERE or Grab as a
                     data provider.
