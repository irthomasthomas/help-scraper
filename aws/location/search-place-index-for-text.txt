SEARCH-PLACE-INDEX-FOR-TEXT()                    SEARCH-PLACE-INDEX-FOR-TEXT()



NAME
       search-place-index-for-text -

DESCRIPTION
       Geocodes  free-form  text, such as an address, name, city, or region to
       allow you to search for Places or points of interest.

       Optional parameters let you narrow your search results by bounding  box
       or  country,  or  bias  your  search  toward a specific position on the
       globe.

       NOTE:
          You can search for places near a given position using BiasPosition ,
          or filter results within a bounding box using FilterBBox . Providing
          both parameters simultaneously returns an error.

       Search results are returned in order of highest to lowest relevance.

OPTIONS
       --bias-position (list)
          An optional parameter that indicates a preference  for  places  that
          are closer to a specified position.

          If  provided,  this  parameter  must  contain a pair of numbers. The
          first number represents the X coordinate, or longitude;  the  second
          number represents the Y coordinate, or latitude.

          For  example, [-123.1174, 49.2847] represents the position with lon-
          gitude -123.1174 and latitude 49.2847 .

          NOTE:
              BiasPosition and FilterBBox are mutually  exclusive.  Specifying
              both options results in an error.

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --filter-b-box (list)
          An  optional  parameter  that limits the search results by returning
          only places that are within the provided bounding box.

          If provided, this parameter must contain a total of four consecutive
          numbers in two pairs. The first pair of numbers represents the X and
          Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively) of  the  south-
          west  corner  of the bounding box; the second pair of numbers repre-
          sents the X and Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively)
          of the northeast corner of the bounding box.

          For  example,  [-12.7935, -37.4835, -12.0684, -36.9542] represents a
          bounding box where the southwest corner has longitude  -12.7935  and
          latitude  -37.4835 , and the northeast corner has longitude -12.0684
          and latitude -36.9542 .

          NOTE:
              FilterBBox and BiasPosition are mutually  exclusive.  Specifying
              both options results in an error.

          (double)

       Syntax:

          double double ...

       --filter-categories (list)
          A  list  of one or more Amazon Location categories to filter the re-
          turned places. If you include more than one  category,  the  results
          will include results that match any of the categories listed.

          For  more  information  about  using categories, including a list of
          Amazon Location categories, see Categories and filtering  ,  in  the
          Amazon Location Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filter-countries (list)
          An  optional  parameter  that limits the search results by returning
          only places that are in a specified list of countries.

          o Valid values include ISO 3166 3-digit country codes. For  example,
            Australia uses three upper-case characters: AUS .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --index-name (string)
          The name of the place index resource you want to use for the search.

       --key (string)
          The optional API key to authorize the request.

       --language (string)
          The  preferred  language used to return results. The value must be a
          valid BCP 47 language tag, for example, en for English.

          This setting affects the languages used in the results, but not  the
          results  themselves.  If  no language is specified, or not supported
          for a particular result, the partner automatically  chooses  a  lan-
          guage for the result.

          For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for Athens,
          Greece , with the language parameter set to en .  The  result  found
          will most likely be returned as Athens .

          If you set the language parameter to el , for Greek, then the result
          found will more likely be returned as  .

          If the data provider does not have a value  for  Greek,  the  result
          will be in a language that the provider does support.

       --max-results (integer)
          An  optional  parameter.  The maximum number of results returned per
          request.

          The default: 50

       --text (string)
          The address, name, city, or region to  be  used  in  the  search  in
          free-form text format. For example, 123 Any Street .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       Results -> (list)
          A list of Places matching the input text. Each result contains addi-
          tional information about the specific point of interest.
