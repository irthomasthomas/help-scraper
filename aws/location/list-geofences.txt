LIST-GEOFENCES()                                              LIST-GEOFENCES()



NAME
       list-geofences -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists geofences stored in a given geofence collection.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-geofences  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Entries

OPTIONS
       --collection-name (string)
          The name of the geofence collection storing the list of geofences.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          (structure)
              Contains a list of geofences stored in a given geofence  collec-
              tion.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp for when the geofence was stored in a geofence
                 collection in ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ

                 User defined properties of the  geofence.  A  property  is  a
                 key-value  pair stored with the geofence and added to any ge-
                 ofence event triggered with that geofence.

                 Format: "key" : "value"

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              Geometry -> (structure)
                 Contains the geofence geometry details describing  a  polygon
                 or a circle.

                 Circle -> (structure)
                     A circle on the earth, as defined by a center point and a
                     radius.

                     Center -> (list)
                        A single point geometry, specifying the center of  the
                        circle,  using WGS 84 coordinates, in the form [longi-
                        tude, latitude] .

                        (double)

                     Radius -> (double)
                        The radius of the circle in meters.  Must  be  greater
                        than zero and no larger than 100,000 (100 kilometers).

                 Polygon -> (list)
                     A  polygon  is a list of linear rings which are each made
                     up of a list of vertices.

                     Each vertex is a 2-dimensional point of the form: [longi-
                     tude, latitude] . This is represented as an array of dou-
                     bles of length 2 (so [double, double] ).

                     An array of 4 or more vertices, where the first and  last
                     vertex  are  the  same  (to  form  a closed boundary), is
                     called a linear ring. The linear ring  vertices  must  be
                     listed  in counter-clockwise order around the rings inte-
                     rior. The linear ring is represented as an array of  ver-
                     tices,  or  an array of arrays of doubles ([[double, dou-
                     ble], ...] ).

                     A geofence consists of a single linear ring. To allow for
                     future expansion, the Polygon parameter takes an array of
                     linear rings, which is represented as an array of  arrays
                     of arrays of doubles ([[[double, double], ...], ...] ).

                     A linear ring for use in geofences can consist of between
                     4 and 1,000 vertices.

                     (list)
                        (list)
                            (double)

              Status -> (string)
                 Identifies the state of the geofence. A  geofence  will  hold
                 one of the following states:

                 o ACTIVE  The geofence has been indexed by the system.

                 o PENDING  The geofence is being processed by the system.

                 o FAILED  The geofence failed to be indexed by the system.

                 o DELETED   The geofence has been deleted from the system in-
                   dex.

                 o DELETING  The geofence is being deleted from the system in-
                   dex.

              UpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  for when the geofence was last updated in ISO
                 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token indicating there are additional pages  available.
          You  can  use the token in a following request to fetch the next set
          of results.
