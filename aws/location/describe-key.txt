OPTIONS
       --key-name (string)
          The name of the API key resource.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Key -> (string)
          The key value/string of an API key.

       KeyArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for the API key resource. Used when
          you need to specify a resource across all Amazon Web Services.

          o Format example: arn:aws:geo:region:account-id:key/ExampleKey

       KeyName -> (string)
          The name of the API key resource.

       Restrictions -> (structure)
          API Restrictions on the allowed actions, resources, and referers for
          an API key resource.

          AllowActions -> (list)
              A  list  of allowed actions that an API key resource grants per-
              missions to perform. You must have at least one action for  each
              type of resource. For example, if you have a place resource, you
              must include at least one place action.

              The following are valid values for the actions.

              o Map actions

                o geo:GetMap* - Allows all actions needed for map rendering.

              o Place actions

                o geo:SearchPlaceIndexForText - Allows geocoding.

                o geo:SearchPlaceIndexForPosition - Allows reverse geocoding.

                o geo:SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions - Allows generating  sug-
                  gestions from text.

                o GetPlace - Allows finding a place by place ID.

              o Route actions

                o geo:CalculateRoute - Allows point to point routing.

                o geo:CalculateRouteMatrix  -  Allows  calculating a matrix of
                  routes.

              NOTE:
                 You must use these strings exactly. For example,  to  provide
                 access to map rendering, the only valid action is geo:GetMap*
                 as an  input  to  the  list.  ["geo:GetMap*"]  is  valid  but
                 ["geo:GetMapTile"]   is   not.   Similarly,  you  cannot  use
                 ["geo:SearchPlaceIndexFor*"] - you  must  list  each  of  the
                 Place actions separately.

              (string)

          AllowResources -> (list)
              A  list  of allowed resource ARNs that a API key bearer can per-
              form actions on.

              o The ARN must be the correct ARN for a  map,  place,  or  route
                ARN.  You  may  include  wildcards in the resource-id to match
                multiple resources of the same type.

              o The resources must be in the same partition , region , and ac-
                count-id as the key that is being created.

              o Other than wildcards, you must include the full ARN, including
                the arn , partition , service , region ,  account-id  and  re-
                source-id delimited by colons (:).

              o No   spaces   allowed,   even  with  wildcards.  For  example,
                arn:aws:geo:region:*account-id* :map/ExampleMap* .

              For more information about ARN format, see Amazon Resource Names
              (ARNs) .

              (string)

          AllowReferers -> (list)
              An  optional  list  of  allowed HTTP referers for which requests
              must originate from. Requests using this API key from other  do-
              mains will not be allowed.

              Requirements:

              o Contain  only alphanumeric characters (AZ, az, 09) or any sym-
                bols in this list $\-._+!*`(),;/?:@=&

              o May contain a percent (%) if followed by 2 hexadecimal  digits
                (A-F, a-f, 0-9); this is used for URL encoding purposes.

              o May contain wildcard characters question mark (?) and asterisk
                (*). Question mark (?) will replace any single character  (in-
                cluding  hexadecimal  digits).  Asterisk  (*) will replace any
                multiple characters (including multiple hexadecimal digits).

              o No spaces allowed. For example, https://example.com .
