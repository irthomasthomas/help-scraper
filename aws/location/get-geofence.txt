OPTIONS
       --collection-name (string)
          The geofence collection storing the target geofence.

       --geofence-id (string)
          The geofence you're retrieving details for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       CreateTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp for when the geofence collection was  created  in  ISO
          8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ

       GeofenceId -> (string)
          The geofence identifier.

       GeofenceProperties -> (map)
          Contains  additional  user-defined  properties  stored  with the ge-
          ofence. An array of key-value pairs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Geometry -> (structure)
          Contains the geofence geometry details describing  a  polygon  or  a
          circle.

          Circle -> (structure)
              A  circle  on  the earth, as defined by a center point and a ra-
              dius.

              Center -> (list)
                 A single point geometry, specifying the center of the circle,
                 using WGS 84 coordinates, in the form [longitude, latitude] .

                 (double)

              Radius -> (double)
                 The radius of the circle in meters. Must be greater than zero
                 and no larger than 100,000 (100 kilometers).

          Polygon -> (list)
              A polygon is a list of linear rings which are each made up of  a
              list of vertices.

              Each  vertex  is  a 2-dimensional point of the form: [longitude,
              latitude] . This is represented as an array of doubles of length
              2 (so [double, double] ).

              An  array of 4 or more vertices, where the first and last vertex
              are the same (to form a closed boundary),  is  called  a  linear
              ring.  The linear ring vertices must be listed in counter-clock-
              wise order around the rings interior. The linear ring is  repre-
              sented as an array of vertices, or an array of arrays of doubles
              ([[double, double], ...] ).

              A geofence consists of a single linear ring. To allow for future
              expansion, the Polygon parameter takes an array of linear rings,
              which is represented as an array of arrays of arrays of  doubles
              ([[[double, double], ...], ...] ).

              A  linear ring for use in geofences can consist of between 4 and
              1,000 vertices.

              (list)
                 (list)
                     (double)

       Status -> (string)
          Identifies the state of the geofence. A geofence will  hold  one  of
          the following states:

          o ACTIVE  The geofence has been indexed by the system.

          o PENDING  The geofence is being processed by the system.

          o FAILED  The geofence failed to be indexed by the system.

          o DELETED  The geofence has been deleted from the system index.

          o DELETING  The geofence is being deleted from the system index.

       UpdateTime -> (timestamp)
          The  timestamp  for when the geofence collection was last updated in
          ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ
