CREATE-LISTENER()                                            CREATE-LISTENER()



NAME
       create-listener -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  listener  for a service. Before you start using your Amazon
       VPC Lattice service, you must add one or more listeners. A listener  is
       a  process  that  checks  for connection requests to your services. For
       more information, see Listeners in the Amazon VPC Lattice User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of  the  request. If you retry a request that completed
          successfully using the same client token and parameters,  the  retry
          succeeds  without  performing  any actions. If the parameters aren't
          identical, the retry fails.

       --default-action (tagged union structure)
          The action for the default rule. Each listener has a  default  rule.
          Each  rule  consists  of a priority, one or more actions, and one or
          more conditions. The default rule is the  rule  that's  used  if  no
          other rules match. Each rule must include exactly one of the follow-
          ing types of actions: forward or fixed-response , and it must be the
          last action to be performed.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: fixedResponse, forward.

          fixedResponse -> (structure)
              Describes the rule action that returns a custom HTTP response.

              statusCode -> (integer)
                 The HTTP response code.

          forward -> (structure)
              The forward action. Traffic that matches the rule  is  forwarded
              to the specified target groups.

              targetGroups -> (list)
                 The  target groups. Traffic matching the rule is forwarded to
                 the specified target groups. With forward  actions,  you  can
                 assign  a  weight that controls the prioritization and selec-
                 tion of each target group. This means that requests are  dis-
                 tributed  to individual target groups based on their weights.
                 For example, if two target groups have the same weight,  each
                 target group receives half of the traffic.

                 The  default  value  is 1. This means that if only one target
                 group is provided, there is no need to set the  weight;  100%
                 of traffic will go to that target group.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the weight of a target group.

                     targetGroupIdentifier -> (string)
                        The  ID  or  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the target
                        group.

                     weight -> (integer)
                        Only required if you specify  multiple  target  groups
                        for  a forward action. The "weight" determines how re-
                        quests are distributed to the target group. For  exam-
                        ple,  if  you  specify  two target groups, each with a
                        weight of 10, each target group receives half the  re-
                        quests.  If  you specify two target groups, one with a
                        weight of 10 and the other with a weight  of  20,  the
                        target  group  with  a  weight of 20 receives twice as
                        many requests as the other target  group.  If  there's
                        only  one  target  group  specified,  then the default
                        value is 100.

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a listener

       The following create-listener example creates an HTTPS listener with  a
       default  rule that forwards traffic to the specified VPC Lattice target
       group.

          aws vpc-lattice create-listener \
              --name my-service-listener \
              --protocol HTTPS \
              --port 443 \
              --service-identifier svc-0285b53b2eEXAMPLE \
              --default-action file://listener-config.json

       Contents of listener-config.json:

          {
              "forward": {
                  "targetGroups": [
                      {
                          "targetGroupIdentifier": "tg-0eaa4b9ab4EXAMPLE"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

       Output:

          {
              "arn": "arn:aws:vpc-lattice:us-east-2:123456789012:service/svc-0285b53b2eEXAMPLE/listener/listener-07cc7fb0abEXAMPLE",
