OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service network or  ser-
          vice.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about an auth policy

       The following get-auth-policy example gets information about  the  auth
       policy for the specified service.

          aws vpc-lattice get-auth-policy \
              --resource-identifier svc-0285b53b2eEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "createdAt": "2023-06-07T03:51:20.266Z",
              "lastUpdatedAt": "2023-06-07T04:39:27.082Z",
              "policy": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-clients\"},\"Action\":\"vpc-lattice-svcs:Invoke\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:vpc-lattice:us-east-2:123456789012:service/svc-0285b53b2eEXAMPLE\"}]}",
              "state": "Active"
          }

       For  more information, see Auth policies in the Amazon VPC Lattice User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       createdAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the auth policy  was  created,  specified  in
          ISO-8601 format.

       lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and time that the auth policy was last updated, specified
          in ISO-8601 format.

       policy -> (string)
          The auth policy.

       state -> (string)
          The state of the auth policy. The auth policy is  only  active  when
          the  auth type is set to AWS_IAM . If you provide a policy, then au-
          thentication and authorization decisions are made based on this pol-
          icy and the client's IAM policy. If the auth type is NONE , then any
          auth policy that you provide remains inactive. For more information,
          see Create a service network in the Amazon VPC Lattice User Guide .
