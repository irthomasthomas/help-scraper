DELETE-SERVICE()                                              DELETE-SERVICE()



NAME
       delete-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a service. A service can't be deleted if it's associated with a
       service network. If you delete a service, all resources related to  the
       service,  such as the resource policy, auth policy, listeners, listener
       rules, and access log subscriptions, are also deleted. For more  infor-
       mation, see Delete a service in the Amazon VPC Lattice User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --service-identifier (string)
          The ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a service

       The following delete-service example deletes the specified service.

          aws vpc-lattice delete-service \
              --service-identifier svc-0285b53b2eEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "arn": "arn:aws:vpc-lattice:us-west-2:123456789012:service/svc-0285b53b2eEXAMPLE",
              "id": "svc-0285b53b2eEXAMPLE",
              "name": "my-lattice-service",
              "status": "DELETE_IN_PROGRESS"
          }

       For more information, see Services in VPC Lattice  in  the  Amazon  VPC
       Lattice User Guide.

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service.

       id -> (string)
          The ID of the service.

       name -> (string)
          The name of the service.

       status -> (string)
          The   status.   You  can  retry  the  operation  if  the  status  is
          DELETE_FAILED . However,  if  you  retry  it  while  the  status  is
          DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , the status doesn't change.
