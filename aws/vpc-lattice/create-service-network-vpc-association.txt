CREATE-SERVICE-NETWORK-VPC-ASSOCIATIONCREATE-SERVICE-NETWORK-VPC-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       create-service-network-vpc-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a VPC with a service network. When you associate a VPC with
       the service network, it enables all the resources within that VPC to be
       clients and communicate with other services in the service network. For
       more information, see Manage VPC associations in the Amazon VPC Lattice
       User Guide .

       You  can't use this operation if there is a disassociation in progress.
       If the association fails, retry by deleting the association and  recre-
       ating it.

       As a result of this operation, the association gets created in the ser-
       vice network account and the VPC owner account.

       Once a security group is added to the VPC association it cannot be  re-
       moved. You can add or update the security groups being used for the VPC
       association once a security group is attached. To remove  all  security
       groups you must reassociate the VPC.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If you retry a  request  that  completed
          successfully  using  the same client token and parameters, the retry
          succeeds without performing any actions. If  the  parameters  aren't
          identical, the retry fails.

       --security-group-ids (list)
          The  IDs of the security groups. Security groups aren't added by de-
          fault. You can add a security group to apply network level  controls
          to  control  which resources in a VPC are allowed to access the ser-
          vice network and its services. For  more  information,  see  Control
          traffic  to  resources  using security groups in the Amazon VPC User
          Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --service-network-identifier (string)
          The ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  service  network.  You
          must  use  the ARN when the resources specified in the operation are
          in different accounts.

       --tags (map)
          The tags for the association.

          key -> (string)
              The key of the tag.

              Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of
              128  Unicode  characters.  Valid characters are Unicode letters,
              digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / =
              + - @ May not begin with aws: .

          value -> (string)
              The value of the tag.

              Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum
              of 256 Unicode characters. Valid characters are Unicode letters,
              digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / =
              + - @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --vpc-identifier (string)
          The ID of the VPC.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a VPC association

       The following create-service-network-vpc-association example associates
       the specified vpc with the specified service network. The specified se-
       curity group controls which resources in the VPC can access the service
       network and its services.

          aws vpc-lattice create-service-network-vpc-association \
              --vpc-identifier vpc-0a1b2c3d4eEXAMPLE \
              --service-network-identifier sn-080ec7dc93EXAMPLE \
              --security-group-ids sg-0aee16bc6cEXAMPLE

       Output:
