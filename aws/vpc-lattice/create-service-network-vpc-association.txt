CREATE-SERVICE-NETWORK-VPC-ASSOCIATIONCREATE-SERVICE-NETWORK-VPC-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       create-service-network-vpc-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a VPC with a service network. When you associate a VPC with
       the service network, it enables all the resources within that VPC to be
       clients and communicate with other services in the service network. For
       more information, see Manage VPC associations in the Amazon VPC Lattice
       User Guide .

       You  can't use this operation if there is a disassociation in progress.
       If the association fails, retry by deleting the association and  recre-
       ating it.

       As a result of this operation, the association gets created in the ser-
       vice network account and the VPC owner account.

       If you add a security group to the service network and VPC association,
       the  association  must  continue  to  always have at least one security
       group. You can add or edit security groups at any time. However, to re-
       move  all  security  groups,  you must first delete the association and
       recreate it without security groups.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of  the  request. If you retry a request that completed
          successfully using the same client token and parameters,  the  retry
          succeeds  without  performing  any actions. If the parameters aren't
          identical, the retry fails.

       --security-group-ids (list)
          The IDs of the security groups. Security groups aren't added by  de-
          fault.  You can add a security group to apply network level controls
          to control which resources in a VPC are allowed to access  the  ser-
          vice  network  and  its  services. For more information, see Control
          traffic to resources using security groups in the  Amazon  VPC  User
          Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --service-network-identifier (string)
          The  ID  or  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the service network. You
          must use the ARN when the resources specified in the  operation  are
          in different accounts.

       --tags (map)
          The tags for the association.

          key -> (string)
              The key of the tag.

              Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of
              128 Unicode characters. Valid characters  are  Unicode  letters,
              digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / =
              + - @ May not begin with aws: .

          value -> (string)
              The value of the tag.

              Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a  maximum
              of 256 Unicode characters. Valid characters are Unicode letters,
              digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / =
              + - @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --vpc-identifier (string)
          The ID of the VPC.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.
