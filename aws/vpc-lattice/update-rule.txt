OPTIONS
       --action (tagged union structure)
          Information about the action for the specified listener rule.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: fixedResponse, forward.

          fixedResponse -> (structure)
              The  fixed  response  action. The rule returns a custom HTTP re-
              sponse.

              statusCode -> (integer)
                 The HTTP response code.

          forward -> (structure)
              The forward action. Traffic that matches the rule  is  forwarded
              to the specified target groups.

              targetGroups -> (list)
                 The  target groups. Traffic matching the rule is forwarded to
                 the specified target groups. With forward  actions,  you  can
                 assign  a  weight that controls the prioritization and selec-
                 tion of each target group. This means that requests are  dis-
                 tributed  to individual target groups based on their weights.
                 For example, if two target groups have the same weight,  each
                 target group receives half of the traffic.

                 The  default  value  is 1. This means that if only one target
                 group is provided, there is no need to set the  weight;  100%
                 of the traffic goes to that target group.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the weight of a target group.

                     targetGroupIdentifier -> (string)
                        The  ID  or  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the target
                        group.

                     weight -> (integer)
                        Only required if you specify  multiple  target  groups
                        for  a  forward  action. The weight determines how re-
                        quests are distributed to the target group. For  exam-
                        ple,  if  you  specify  two target groups, each with a
                        weight of 10, each target group receives half the  re-
                        quests.  If  you specify two target groups, one with a
                        weight of 10 and the other with a weight  of  20,  the
                        target  group  with  a  weight of 20 receives twice as
                        many requests as the other target  group.  If  there's
                        only  one  target  group  specified,  then the default
                        value is 100.

       the string will be taken literally.

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
