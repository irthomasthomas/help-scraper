OPTIONS
       --target-group-identifier (string)
          The ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.

       --targets (list)
          The targets to deregister.

          (structure)
              Describes a target.

              id -> (string)
                 The  ID of the target. If the target type of the target group
                 is INSTANCE , this is an instance ID. If the target  type  is
                 IP  ,  this  is an IP address. If the target type is LAMBDA ,
                 this is the ARN of the Lambda function. If the target type is
                 ALB , this is the ARN of the Application Load Balancer.

              port -> (integer)
                 The  port on which the target is listening. For HTTP, the de-
                 fault is 80 . For HTTPS, the default is 443 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          id=string,port=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "id": "string",
              "port": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To deregister a target

       The following deregister-targets example deregisters the specified tar-
       get from the specified target group.

          aws vpc-lattice deregister-targets \
              --targets i-07dd579bc5EXAMPLE \
              --target-group-identifier tg-0eaa4b9ab4EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "successful": [
                  {
                      "id": "i-07dd579bc5EXAMPLE",
                      "port": 443
                  }
              ],
              "unsuccessful": []
          }

       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       successful -> (list)
          The targets that were successfully deregistered.

          (structure)
              Describes a target.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the target. If the target type of the target  group
                 is  INSTANCE  , this is an instance ID. If the target type is
                 IP , this is an IP address. If the target type  is  LAMBDA  ,
                 this is the ARN of the Lambda function. If the target type is
                 ALB , this is the ARN of the Application Load Balancer.

              port -> (integer)
                 The port on which the target is listening. For HTTP, the  de-
                 fault is 80 . For HTTPS, the default is 443 .

       unsuccessful -> (list)
          The targets that the operation couldn't deregister.

          (structure)
              Describes a target failure.

              id -> (string)
                 The  ID of the target. If the target type of the target group
                 is INSTANCE , this is an instance ID. If the target  type  is
                 IP  ,  this  is an IP address. If the target type is LAMBDA ,
                 this is the ARN of the Lambda function. If the target type is
