OPTIONS
       --health-check (structure)
          The health check configuration.

          enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether health checking is enabled.

          healthCheckIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
              The  approximate  amount  of  time,  in  seconds, between health
              checks of an individual target. The range is 5300  seconds.  The
              default is 30 seconds.

          healthCheckTimeoutSeconds -> (integer)
              The  amount of time, in seconds, to wait before reporting a tar-
              get as unhealthy. The range is 1120 seconds. The  default  is  5
              seconds.

          healthyThresholdCount -> (integer)
              The  number of consecutive successful health checks required be-
              fore considering an unhealthy target healthy. The range is  210.
              The default is 5.

          matcher -> (tagged union structure)
              The  codes to use when checking for a successful response from a
              target.

              NOTE:
                 This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the  following
                 top level keys can be set: httpCode.

              httpCode -> (string)
                 The  HTTP code to use when checking for a successful response
                 from a target.

          path -> (string)
              The destination for health checks on the targets. If the  proto-
              col version is HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 , specify a valid URI (for ex-
              ample, /path?query ). The default path is / . Health checks  are
              not supported if the protocol version is gRPC , however, you can
              choose HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 and specify a valid URI.

          port -> (integer)
              The port used when performing health checks on targets. The  de-
              fault setting is the port that a target receives traffic on.

          protocol -> (string)
              The  protocol used when performing health checks on targets. The
              possible protocols are HTTP and HTTPS . The default is HTTP .

          protocolVersion -> (string)
              The protocol version used when performing health checks on  tar-
              gets. The possible protocol versions are HTTP1 and HTTP2 .

          unhealthyThresholdCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of consecutive failed health checks required before
              considering a target unhealthy. The range is 210. The default is
              2.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          enabled=boolean,healthCheckIntervalSeconds=integer,healthCheckTimeoutSeconds=integer,healthyThresholdCount=integer,matcher={httpCode=string},path=string,port=integer,protocol=string,protocolVersion=string,unhealthyThresholdCount=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "enabled": true|false,
            "healthCheckIntervalSeconds": integer,
            "healthCheckTimeoutSeconds": integer,
            "healthyThresholdCount": integer,
            "matcher": {
              "httpCode": "string"
            },
            "path": "string",
            "port": integer,
            "protocol": "HTTP"|"HTTPS"|"TCP",
            "protocolVersion": "HTTP1"|"HTTP2",
            "unhealthyThresholdCount": integer
          }

       --target-group-identifier (string)
          The ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
