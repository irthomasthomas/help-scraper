CONTINUE-UPDATE-ROLLBACK()                          CONTINUE-UPDATE-ROLLBACK()



NAME
       continue-update-rollback -

DESCRIPTION
       For  a specified stack that's in the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state, con-
       tinues rolling it back to the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state. Depending
       on  the  cause  of the failure, you can manually fix the error and con-
       tinue the rollback. By continuing the rollback,  you  can  return  your
       stack to a working state (the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state), and then
       try to update the stack again.

       A stack goes into the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state when  CloudFormation
       can't  roll  back all changes after a failed stack update. For example,
       you might have a stack that's rolling back to an old database  instance
       that  was  deleted  outside  of  CloudFormation. Because CloudFormation
       doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the database in-
       stance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update
       rollback to fail.

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name or the unique ID of the stack that  you  want  to  continue
          rolling back.

          NOTE:
              Don't  specify the name of a nested stack (a stack that was cre-
              ated by using the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource). Instead,
              use  this operation on the parent stack (the stack that contains
              the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource).

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM  role  that  CloudFormation
          assumes  to roll back the stack. CloudFormation uses the role's cre-
          dentials to make calls on your behalf.  CloudFormation  always  uses
          this  role  for  all  future  operations on the stack. Provided that
          users have permission to operate on the stack,  CloudFormation  uses
          this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure
          that the role grants least permission.

          If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that  was
          previously  associated  with  the  stack.  If  no role is available,
          CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated  from  your
          user credentials.

       --resources-to-skip (list)
          A list of the logical IDs of the resources that CloudFormation skips
          during the continue update rollback operation. You can specify  only
          resources  that  are  in  the UPDATE_FAILED state because a rollback
          failed. You can't specify resources that are  in  the  UPDATE_FAILED
          state  for  other  reasons,  for example, because an update was can-
          celed.  To  check  why  a  resource  update  failed,  use  the   De-
          scribeStackResources action, and view the resource status reason.

          WARNING:
              Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that Cloud-
              Formation can't successfully roll back. We  recommend  that  you
              troubleshoot resources before skipping them. CloudFormation sets
              the status of the specified  resources  to  UPDATE_COMPLETE  and
              continues  to  roll  back  the stack. After the rollback is com-
              plete, the state of the skipped resources will  be  inconsistent
              with  the  state  of the resources in the stack template. Before
              performing another stack update, you must update  the  stack  or
              resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subse-
              quent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become  unre-
              coverable.

          Specify  the  minimum  number  of resources required to successfully
          roll back your stack. For example, a failed  resource  update  might
          cause  dependent  resources  to  fail. In this case, it might not be
          necessary to skip the dependent resources.

          To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the  following
          format:  NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID  . If you want to specify
          the logical ID of a stack resource (Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
          ) in the ResourcesToSkip list, then its corresponding embedded stack
          must be  in  one  of  the  following  states:  DELETE_IN_PROGRESS  ,
          DELETE_COMPLETE , or DELETE_FAILED .

          NOTE:
              Don't  confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logi-
              cal ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue
              update  rollback  operation  with  nested  stacks,  see Continue
              rolling back from failed nested stack updates .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this ContinueUpdateRollback request. Specify
          this  token  if  you  plan  to retry requests so that CloudFormation
          knows that you're not attempting to continue the rollback to a stack
          with  the same name. You might retry ContinueUpdateRollback requests
          to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retry an update rollback

       The following continue-update-rollback example resumes a rollback oper-
       ation from a previously failed stack update.

          aws cloudformation continue-update-rollback \
              --stack-name my-stack

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
