LIST-CHANGE-SETS()                                          LIST-CHANGE-SETS()



NAME
       list-change-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  ID  and status of each active change set for a stack. For
       example,  CloudFormation  lists  change  sets  that  are  in  the  CRE-
       ATE_IN_PROGRESS or CREATE_PENDING state.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-change-sets  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Summaries

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  stack  for  which
          you want to list change sets.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list change sets

       The following list-change-sets example displays a list of  the  pending
       change sets for the specified stack.

          aws cloudformation list-change-sets \
             --stack-name my-stack

       Output:

          {
              "Summaries": [
                  {
                      "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/my-stack/d0a825a0-e4cd-xmpl-b9fb-061c69e99204",
                      "StackName": "my-stack",
                      "ChangeSetId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:changeSet/my-change-set/70160340-7914-xmpl-bcbf-128a1fa78b5d",
                      "ChangeSetName": "my-change-set",
                      "ExecutionStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "Status": "CREATE_COMPLETE",
                      "CreationTime": "2019-10-02T05:38:54.297Z"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A  list of ChangeSetSummary structures that provides the ID and sta-
          tus of each change set for the specified stack.

          (structure)
              The ChangeSetSummary structure describes a change set, its  sta-
              tus, and the stack with which it's associated.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack with which the change set is associated.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the stack with which the change set is associ-
                 ated.

              ChangeSetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the change set.

              ChangeSetName -> (string)
                 The name of the change set.

              ExecutionStatus -> (string)
                 If the change set execution status is AVAILABLE , you can ex-
                 ecute  the  change  set. If you can't execute the change set,
                 the status indicates why. For example, a change set might  be
                 in  an UNAVAILABLE state because CloudFormation is still cre-
                 ating it or in an OBSOLETE state because the  stack  was  al-
                 ready updated.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  state  of  the  change set, such as CREATE_IN_PROGRESS ,
                 CREATE_COMPLETE , or FAILED .

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 A description of the change set's  status.  For  example,  if
                 your  change set is in the FAILED state, CloudFormation shows
                 the error message.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The start time when the change set was created, in UTC.

              Description -> (string)
                 Descriptive information about the change set.

              IncludeNestedStacks -> (boolean)
                 Specifies the current setting of IncludeNestedStacks for  the
                 change set.

              ParentChangeSetId -> (string)
                 The parent change set ID.

              RootChangeSetId -> (string)
                 The root change set ID.

              ImportExistingResources -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  if  the  change set imports resources that already
                 exist.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the output exceeds 1 MB, a string that identifies the  next  page
          of change sets. If there is no additional page, this value is null .
