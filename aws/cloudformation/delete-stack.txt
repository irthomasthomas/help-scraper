DELETE-STACK()                                                  DELETE-STACK()



NAME
       delete-stack -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a specified stack. Once the call completes successfully, stack
       deletion starts. Deleted stacks don't show up  in  the   DescribeStacks
       operation if the deletion has been completed successfully.

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name or the unique stack ID that's associated with the stack.

       --retain-resources (list)
          For  stacks  in  the DELETE_FAILED state, a list of resource logical
          IDs that are associated with the resources you want to retain.  Dur-
          ing  deletion,  CloudFormation  deletes the stack but doesn't delete
          the retained resources.

          Retaining resources is useful when you can't delete a resource, such
          as a non-empty S3 bucket, but you want to delete the stack.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes to delete the  stack.  Cloud-
          Formation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.

          If  you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was
          previously associated with the  stack.  If  no  role  is  available,
          CloudFormation  uses  a temporary session that's generated from your
          user credentials.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this DeleteStack request. Specify this token
          if  you  plan  to  retry  requests so that CloudFormation knows that
          you're not attempting to delete a stack  with  the  same  name.  You
          might  retry DeleteStack requests to ensure that CloudFormation suc-
          cessfully received them.

          All events initiated by a given stack  operation  are  assigned  the
          same  client  request  token, which you can use to track operations.
          For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with  the  token
          token1  ,  then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will
          have ClientRequestToken set as token1 .

          In the console, stack operations display the client request token on
          the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console
          use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID  ,  which  helps  you
          easily  identify  the stack operation . For example, if you create a
          stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same
          token      in     the     following     format:     Console-CreateS-
          tack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002 .

       --deletion-mode (string)
          Specifies the deletion mode for the stack. Possible values are:

          o STANDARD - Use the standard behavior. Specifying this value is the
            same as not specifying this parameter.

          o FORCE_DELETE_STACK   -  Delete  the  stack  if  it's  stuck  in  a
            DELETE_FAILED state due to resource deletion failure.

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o FORCE_DELETE_STACK

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
