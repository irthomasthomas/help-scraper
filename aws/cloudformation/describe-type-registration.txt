DESCRIBE-TYPE-REGISTRATION()                      DESCRIBE-TYPE-REGISTRATION()



NAME
       describe-type-registration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  an extension's registration, including its
       current status and type and version identifiers.

       When you initiate a registration request using ``   RegisterType  ``  ,
       you  can  then  use  ``   DescribeTypeRegistration  ``  to  monitor the
       progress of that registration request.

       Once the registration request has completed, use ``  DescribeType `` to
       return detailed information about an extension.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-type-registration
          --registration-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registration-token (string)
          The identifier for this registration request.

          This registration token is generated by CloudFormation when you ini-
          tiate a registration request using ``  RegisterType `` .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To display type registration information

       The following describe-type-registration example  displays  information
       about  the  specified  type  registration, including the type's current
       status, type, and version.

          aws cloudformation describe-type-registration \
              --registration-token a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "ProgressStatus": "COMPLETE",
              "TypeArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/resource/My-Logs-LogGroup",
              "Description": "Deployment is currently in DEPLOY_STAGE of status COMPLETED; ",
              "TypeVersionArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/resource/My-Logs-LogGroup/00000001"
          }
