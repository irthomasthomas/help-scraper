OPTIONS
       --target-type (string)
          The type of operation being targeted by the Hook.

          Possible values:

          o CHANGE_SET

          o STACK

          o RESOURCE

          o CLOUD_CONTROL

       --target-id (string)
          The logical ID of the target the operation is acting on by the Hook.
          If the target is a change set, it's the ARN of the change set.

          If  the  target  is  a Cloud Control API operation, this will be the
          HookRequestToken returned by the Cloud  Control  API  operation  re-
          quest.   For   more   information  on  the  HookRequestToken  ,  see
          ProgressEvent .

       --next-token (string)
          A string that identifies the next page of events that  you  want  to
          retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TargetType -> (string)
          The type of operation being targeted by the Hook.

       TargetId -> (string)
          The logical ID of the target the operation is acting on by the Hook.
          If the target is a change set, it's the ARN of the change set.

          If the target is a Cloud Control API operation,  this  will  be  the
          HooksRequestToken  returned  by  the Cloud Control API operation re-
          quest.  For  more  information  on  the  HooksRequestToken   ,   see
          ProgressEvent .

       HookResults -> (list)
          A  list of HookResultSummary structures that provides the status and
          Hook status reason for each Hook invocation for the  specified  tar-
          get.

          (structure)
              Describes  a Hook invocation, its status, and the reason for its
              status.

              InvocationPoint -> (string)
                 The exact point in the  provisioning  logic  where  the  Hook
                 runs.

              FailureMode -> (string)
                 The  failure mode of the invocation. The following are poten-
                 tial modes:

                 o FAIL : If the hook invocation returns a failure,  then  the
                   requested target operation should fail.

                 o WARN  :  If the hook invocation returns a failure, then the
                   requested target operation should warn.

              TypeName -> (string)
                 The type name of the Hook being invoked.

              TypeVersionId -> (string)
                 The version of the Hook being invoked.

              TypeConfigurationVersionId -> (string)
                 The version of the Hook type configuration.

              Status -> (string)
                 The state of the Hook invocation.

              HookStatusReason -> (string)
                 A description of the Hook results status. For example, if the
                 Hook result is in a FAILED state, this may contain additional
                 information for the FAILED state.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Pagination token, null or empty if no more results.
