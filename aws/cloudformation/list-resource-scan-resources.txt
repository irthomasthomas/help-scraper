LIST-RESOURCE-SCAN-RESOURCES()                  LIST-RESOURCE-SCAN-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-resource-scan-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  resources from a resource scan. The results can be filtered
       by resource identifier, resource type prefix, tag key, and  tag  value.
       Only  resources  that match all specified filters are returned. The re-
       sponse indicates whether each returned resource is already  managed  by
       CloudFormation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-resource-scan-resources  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: Resources

OPTIONS
       --resource-scan-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource scan.

       --resource-identifier (string)
          If specified, the returned resources will  have  the  specified  re-
          source identifier (or one of them in the case where the resource has
          multiple identifiers).

       --resource-type-prefix (string)
          If specified, the returned resources will be of any of the  resource
          types with the specified prefix.

       --tag-key (string)
          If specified, the returned resources will have a matching tag key.

       --tag-value (string)
          If specified, the returned resources will have a matching tag value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Resources -> (list)
          List of up to MaxResults resources in the  specified  resource  scan
          that match all of the specified filters.

          (structure)
              A  scanned  resource  returned  by  ListResourceScanResources or
              ListResourceScanRelatedResources .

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of the resource, such as AWS::DynamoDB::Table .  For
                 the  list  of  supported resources, see Resource type support
                 for imports and drift detection In  the  CloudFormation  User
                 Guide

              ResourceIdentifier -> (map)
                 A  list  of up to 256 key-value pairs that identifies for the
                 scanned resource. The key is the name of one of  the  primary
                 identifiers for the resource. (Primary identifiers are speci-
                 fied in the primaryIdentifier list in the  resource  schema.)
                 The  value is the value of that primary identifier. For exam-
                 ple, for a AWS::DynamoDB::Table resource, the primary identi-
                 fiers  is  TableName  so  the key-value pair could be "Table-
                 Name":   "MyDDBTable"   .   For   more    information,    see
                 primaryIdentifier  in  the CloudFormation Command Line Inter-
                 face (CLI) User Guide .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              ManagedByStack -> (boolean)
                 If true , the resource is managed by a CloudFormation stack.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all the remaining  results,  NextToken
          is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call ListRe-
          sourceScanResources again and use that value for the  NextToken  pa-
          rameter.  If the request returns all results, NextToken is set to an
          empty string.
