LIST-RESOURCE-SCANS()                                    LIST-RESOURCE-SCANS()



NAME
       list-resource-scans -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  resource scans from newest to oldest. By default it will re-
       turn up to 10 resource scans.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-resource-scans is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ResourceScanSummaries

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResourceScanSummaries -> (list)
          The list of scans returned.

          (structure)
              A  summary of the resource scan. This is returned by the ListRe-
              sourceScan API action.

              ResourceScanId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource scan.

              Status -> (string)
                 Status of the resource scan.
                     INPROGRESS

                 The resource scan is still in progress.
                     COMPLETE

                 The resource scan is complete.
                     EXPIRED

                 The resource scan has expired.
                     FAILED

                 The resource scan has failed.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 The reason for the resource scan status, providing  more  in-
                 formation if a failure happened.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the resource scan was started.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the resource scan was finished.

              PercentageCompleted -> (double)
                 The percentage of the resource scan that has been completed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  request doesn't return all the remaining results, NextToken
          is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call ListRe-
          sourceScans again and use that value for the NextToken parameter. If
          the request returns all  results,  NextToken  is  set  to  an  empty
          string.
