DETECT-STACK-RESOURCE-DRIFT()                    DETECT-STACK-RESOURCE-DRIFT()



NAME
       detect-stack-resource-drift -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  whether  a resource's actual configuration
       differs, or has drifted , from its expected configuration,  as  defined
       in  the stack template and any values specified as template parameters.
       This information includes actual and expected property values  for  re-
       sources in which CloudFormation detects drift. Only resource properties
       explicitly defined in the stack template are  checked  for  drift.  For
       more  information about stack and resource drift, see Detecting Unregu-
       lated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

       Use DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on  individual  resources,
       or   DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all resources in a given stack
       that support drift detection.

       Resources  that  don't  currently  support  drift  detection  can't  be
       checked.  For  a  list  of  resources that support drift detection, see
       Resources that Support Drift Detection .

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack to which the resource belongs.

       --logical-resource-id (string)
          The logical name of the resource for which to return drift  informa-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detect drift for a resource

       The following detect-stack-resource-drift  example  checks  a  resource
       named MyFunction in a stack named MyStack for drift:

          aws cloudformation detect-stack-resource-drift \
             --stack-name MyStack \
             --logical-resource-id MyFunction

       The output shows an AWS Lambda function that was modified out-of-band:

OUTPUT
       StackResourceDrift -> (structure)
          Information  about  whether  the resource's actual configuration has
          drifted from its expected template configuration,  including  actual
          and expected property values and any differences detected.

          StackId -> (string)
              The ID of the stack.

          LogicalResourceId -> (string)
              The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

          PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
              The name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical in-
              stance ID of a resource supported by CloudFormation.

          PhysicalResourceIdContext -> (list)
              Context information  that  enables  CloudFormation  to  uniquely
              identify a resource. CloudFormation uses context key-value pairs
              in cases where a resource's  logical  and  physical  IDs  aren't
              enough   to   uniquely  identify  that  resource.  Each  context
              key-value pair specifies a unique  resource  that  contains  the
              targeted resource.

              (structure)
                 Context  information  that enables CloudFormation to uniquely
                 identify a resource. CloudFormation  uses  context  key-value
                 pairs  in  cases  where a resource's logical and physical IDs
                 aren't enough to uniquely identify that resource.  Each  con-
                 text  key-value  pair  specifies a resource that contains the
                 targeted resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The resource context key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The resource context value.

          ResourceType -> (string)
              The type of the resource.

          ExpectedProperties -> (string)
              A JSON structure containing the expected property values of  the
              stack  resource, as defined in the stack template and any values
              specified as template parameters.

              For resources whose StackResourceDriftStatus is DELETED  ,  this
              structure will not be present.

          ActualProperties -> (string)
              A  JSON  structure  containing the actual property values of the
              stack resource.

              For resources whose StackResourceDriftStatus is DELETED  ,  this
              structure will not be present.

          PropertyDifferences -> (list)
              A collection of the resource properties whose actual values dif-
              fer from their expected values. These will be present  only  for
              resources whose StackResourceDriftStatus is MODIFIED .

              (structure)
                 Information about a resource property whose actual value dif-
                 fers from its expected value, as defined in  the  stack  tem-
                 plate  and any values specified as template parameters. These
                 will be present only for resources whose  StackResourceDrift-
                 Status  is MODIFIED . For more information, see Detecting Un-
                 regulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

                 PropertyPath -> (string)

                 ExpectedValue -> (string)
                     The expected property value of the resource property,  as
                     defined in the stack template and any values specified as
                     template parameters.

                 ActualValue -> (string)
                     The actual property value of the resource property.

                 DifferenceType -> (string)
                     The type of property difference.

                     o ADD : A value has been added  to  a  resource  property
                       that's an array or list data type.

                     o REMOVE : The property has been removed from the current
                       resource configuration.

                     o NOT_EQUAL : The current property value differs from its
                       expected  value  (as  defined in the stack template and
                       any values specified as template parameters).

          StackResourceDriftStatus -> (string)
              Status of the resource's actual configuration  compared  to  its
              expected configuration.

              o DELETED : The resource differs from its expected template con-
                figuration because the resource has been deleted.

              o MODIFIED : One or more resource properties differ  from  their
                expected values (as defined in the stack template and any val-
                ues specified as template parameters).

              o IN_SYNC : The resource's actual configuration matches its  ex-
                pected template configuration.

              o NOT_CHECKED  :  CloudFormation  does not currently return this
                value.

          Timestamp -> (timestamp)
              Time at which CloudFormation performed drift  detection  on  the
              stack resource.

          ModuleInfo -> (structure)
              Contains  information  about  the module from which the resource
              was created, if the resource was created from a module  included
              in the stack template.

              TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                 A  concatenated  list  of the module type or types containing
                 the resource. Module types are listed starting with  the  in-
                 ner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                 In  the  following  example,  the resource was created from a
                 module of type AWS::First::Example::MODULE  ,  that's  nested
                 inside a parent module of type AWS::Second::Example::MODULE .
                     AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MODULE

              LogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)
                 A  concatenated list of the logical IDs of the module or mod-
                 ules containing the resource.  Modules  are  listed  starting
                 with the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                 In  the  following  example,  the resource was created from a
                 module, moduleA , that's nested inside a parent module,  mod-
                 uleB .
                     moduleA/moduleB
