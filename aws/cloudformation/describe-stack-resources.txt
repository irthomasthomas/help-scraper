DESCRIBE-STACK-RESOURCES()                          DESCRIBE-STACK-RESOURCES()



NAME
       describe-stack-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  Amazon  Web  Services  resource  descriptions  for running and
       deleted stacks. If StackName is specified, all the associated resources
       that are part of the stack are returned. If PhysicalResourceId is spec-
       ified, the associated resources of the stack that the resource  belongs
       to are returned.

       NOTE:
          Only  the  first  100  resources will be returned. If your stack has
          more resources than this, you should use ListStackResources instead.

       For deleted stacks, DescribeStackResources returns resource information
       for up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted.

       You must specify either StackName or PhysicalResourceId , but not both.
       In addition, you can specify LogicalResourceId to filter  the  returned
       result. For more information about resources, the LogicalResourceId and
       PhysicalResourceId , go to the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NOTE:
          A ValidationError is returned if  you  specify  both  StackName  and
          PhysicalResourceId in the same request.

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name  or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack,
          which aren't always interchangeable:

          o Running stacks: You can specify either the  stack's  name  or  its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

          Required:  Conditional.  If  you  don't specify StackName , you must
          specify PhysicalResourceId .

       --logical-resource-id (string)
          The logical name of the resource as specified in the template.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --physical-resource-id (string)
          The name or unique identifier that corresponds  to  a  physical  in-
          stance ID of a resource supported by CloudFormation.

          For  example,  for  an  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance,
          PhysicalResourceId corresponds to the InstanceId . You can pass  the
          EC2 InstanceId to DescribeStackResources to find which stack the in-
          stance belongs to and what other resources are part of the stack.

          Required: Conditional. If you don't specify PhysicalResourceId , you
          must specify StackName .

          Default: There is no default value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following describe-stack-resources example displays details for the
       resources in the specified stack.

                 differs, or has drifted , from its expected configuration, as
                 defined  in  the  stack  template and any values specified as

                       have  a  status  of NOT_CHECKED . For more information,

              ModuleInfo -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the module from which the resource

                 cluded in the stack template.

                 TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                     A concatenated list of the module type or types  contain-
                     ing  the  resource. Module types are listed starting with

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module   of  type  AWS::First::Example::MODULE  ,  that's
                     nested inside a parent module of type  AWS::Second::Exam-
                     ple::MODULE .

                     modules  containing  the  resource.  Modules  are  listed
                     starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated
                     by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module, moduleA , that's nested inside a  parent  module,
                     moduleB .
                        moduleA/moduleB
