LIST-STACK-RESOURCES()                                  LIST-STACK-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-stack-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns descriptions of all resources of the specified stack.

       For deleted stacks, ListStackResources returns resource information for
       up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-stack-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: StackResourceSummaries

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name  or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack,
          which aren't always interchangeable:

          o Running stacks: You can specify either the  stack's  name  or  its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              DriftInformation -> (structure)
                 Information about whether the resource's actual configuration
                 differs, or has drifted , from its expected configuration, as
                 defined in the stack template and  any  values  specified  as
                 template  parameters. For more information, see Detecting Un-

                 StackResourceDriftStatus -> (string)
                     Status of the resource's actual configuration compared to
                     its expected configuration.

                     o DELETED  :  The resource differs from its expected con-
                       figuration in that it has been deleted.

                     o MODIFIED : The resource differs from its expected  con-

                       performed an   ContinueUpdateRollback  operation  on  a
                       stack,  any  resources included in ResourcesToSkip will
                       also have a status of NOT_CHECKED . For  more  informa-
                       tion  about  skipping  resources during rollback opera-

                       CloudFormation User Guide.

                     o IN_SYNC  :  The resource's actual configuration matches
                       its expected configuration.

                 LastCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     When CloudFormation last  checked  if  the  resource  had
                     drifted from its expected configuration.

              ModuleInfo -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the module from which the resource
                 was created, if the resource was created from  a  module  in-
                 cluded in the stack template.

                 TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                     A  concatenated list of the module type or types contain-
                     ing the resource. Module types are listed  starting  with
                     the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module  of  type  AWS::First::Example::MODULE  ,   that's
                     nested  inside a parent module of type AWS::Second::Exam-
                     ple::MODULE .
                        AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MOD-
                        ULE

                 LogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)
                     A  concatenated  list of the logical IDs of the module or
                     modules  containing  the  resource.  Modules  are  listed
                     starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated
                     by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module,  moduleA  , that's nested inside a parent module,
                     moduleB .
                        moduleA/moduleB

                     ule in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  output exceeds 1 MB, a string that identifies the next page
          of stack resources. If no additional  page  exists,  this  value  is
          null.
