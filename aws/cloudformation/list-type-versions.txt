OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          The kind of the extension.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

          o HOOK

       --type-name (string)
          The  name of the extension for which you want version summary infor-
          mation.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension for which  you  want
          version summary information.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If
          the number of available results exceeds this maximum,  the  response
          includes  a NextToken value that you can assign to the NextToken re-
          quest parameter to get the next set of results.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining
          results, the response object's NextToken parameter value is set to a
          token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this  action  again
          and  assign  that token to the request object's NextToken parameter.
          If there are no remaining results, the  previous  response  object's
          NextToken parameter is set to null .

       --deprecated-status (string)
          The  deprecation  status  of the extension versions that you want to
          get summary information about.

          Valid values include:

          o LIVE : The extension version is registered  and  can  be  used  in
            CloudFormation  operations, dependent on its provisioning behavior
            and visibility scope.

          o DEPRECATED : The extension version has been deregistered  and  can
            no longer be used in CloudFormation operations.

          The default is LIVE .

          Possible values:

          o LIVE

          o DEPRECATED

       --publisher-id (string)
          The publisher ID of the extension publisher.

          Extensions published by Amazon aren't assigned a publisher ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list an extension's version

       The following list-type-versions example  returns  summary  information
       about the versions of an extension.

          aws cloudformation list-type-versions \
            --endpoint https://example.com \
            --region us-west-2 \
            --type RESOURCE \
            --type-name My::Resource::Example \
            --publisher-id 123456789012

       This command produces no output.

       For  more information, see Using the AWS CloudFormation registry in the
       AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

OUTPUT
       TypeVersionSummaries -> (list)
          A list of TypeVersionSummary  structures  that  contain  information
          about the specified extension's versions.

          (structure)
              Contains  summary  information  about  a  specific  version of a
              CloudFormation extension.

              Type -> (string)
                 The kind of extension.

              TypeName -> (string)
                 The name of the extension.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 The ID of a specific version of the extension. The version ID
                 is the value at the end of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) as-
                 signed to the extension version when it's registered.

              IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
                 Whether the specified extension version is set as the default
                 version.

                 This  applies  only to private extensions you have registered
                 in your account, and extensions published by Amazon. For pub-
                 lic third-party extensions, CloudFormation returns null .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension version.

              TimeCreated -> (timestamp)
                 When the version was registered.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the extension version.

              PublicVersionNumber -> (string)
                 For  public  extensions that have been activated for this ac-
                 count and Region, the version of the public extension  to  be
                 used  for  CloudFormation  operations in this account and Re-
                 gion. For any extensions other than activated third-party ex-
                 tensions, CloudFormation returns null .

                 How  you specified AutoUpdate when enabling the extension af-
                 fects whether CloudFormation automatically updates the exten-
                 sion  in  this  account  and Region when a new version is re-
                 leased. For more information, see Automatically use new  ver-
                 sions of extensions in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the request doesn't return all of the remaining results, NextTo-
          ken is set to a token. To retrieve the next  set  of  results,  call
          this  action  again  and  assign  that token to the request object's
          NextToken parameter. If the request returns all  results,  NextToken
          is set to null .
