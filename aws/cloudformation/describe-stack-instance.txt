OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  or  the unique stack ID of the stack set that you want to
          get stack instance information for.

       --stack-instance-account (string)
          The ID of an Amazon Web Services account that's associated with this
          stack instance.

       --stack-instance-region (string)
          The name of a Region that's associated with this stack instance.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              have been overridden in this stack instance.

              (structure)
                 The Parameter data type.

                 ParameterKey -> (string)
                     The key associated with the parameter. If you don't spec-
                     ify a key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFor-
                     mation  uses  the  default value that's specified in your

                 ParameterValue -> (string)
                     The input value associated with the parameter.

                 UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)

                     that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you
                     specify true , do not specify a parameter value.

                 ResolvedValue -> (string)
                     Read-only. The value that corresponds to a SSM  parameter
                     key.   This   field   is   returned   only   for   `  SSM
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types`__
                     parameter types in the template.

          Status -> (string)
              The  status  of the stack instance, in terms of its synchroniza-
              tion with its associated stack set.

              o INOPERABLE : A DeleteStackInstances operation has  failed  and
                left  the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are
                excluded from further  UpdateStackSet  operations.  You  might
                need to perform a DeleteStackInstances operation, with Retain-
                Stacks set to true , to delete the stack  instance,  and  then
                delete the stack manually.

              o OUTDATED : The stack isn't currently up to date with the stack
                set because:

                o The associated stack failed during a CreateStackSet  or  Up-
                  dateStackSet operation.

                o The stack was part of a CreateStackSet or UpdateStackSet op-
                  eration that failed or was stopped before the stack was cre-
                  ated or updated.

              o CURRENT  :  The  stack  is currently up to date with the stack
                set.

          StackInstanceStatus -> (structure)
              The detailed status of the stack instance.

              DetailedStatus -> (string)

                 o CANCELLED : The operation in the specified account and  Re-
                   gion  has  been canceled. This is either because a user has
                   stopped the stack set operation,  or  because  the  failure
                   tolerance of the stack set operation has been exceeded.

                 o FAILED  : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   failed. If the stack set operation fails in enough accounts
                   within  a  Region,  the failure tolerance for the stack set
                   operation as a whole might be exceeded.

                 o INOPERABLE : A DeleteStackInstances  operation  has  failed
                   and  left  the  stack  in an unstable state. Stacks in this
                   state are excluded from further UpdateStackSet  operations.
                   You might need to perform a DeleteStackInstances operation,
                   with RetainStacks set to true , to  delete  the  stack  in-
                   stance, and then delete the stack manually.

                 o PENDING : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   has yet to start.

                 o RUNNING : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   is currently in progress.

                 o SUCCEEDED  : The operation in the specified account and Re-
                   gion completed successfully.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              The explanation for the specific status code that's assigned  to
              this stack instance.

          OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
              [Service-managed  permissions] The organization root ID or orga-
              nizational   unit   (OU)   IDs   that    you    specified    for
              DeploymentTargets .

          DriftStatus -> (string)
              Status  of the stack instance's actual configuration compared to
              the expected template and parameter configuration of  the  stack
              set to which it belongs.

              o DRIFTED : The stack differs from the expected template and pa-
                rameter configuration of the stack set to which it belongs.  A
                stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or more of
                the resources in the associated stack have drifted.

              o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation hasn't checked if the  stack  in-
                stance differs from its expected stack set configuration.

              o IN_SYNC  :  The  stack instance's actual configuration matches
                its expected stack set configuration.

              o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

          LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detection
              operation on the stack instance. This value will be NULL for any
              stack instance on which drift detection  hasn't  yet  been  per-
              formed.

          LastOperationId -> (string)
              The  last unique ID of a StackSet operation performed on a stack
              instance.
