REGISTER-TYPE()                                                REGISTER-TYPE()



NAME
       register-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  an extension with the CloudFormation service. Registering an
       extension makes it available for use  in  CloudFormation  templates  in
       your Amazon Web Services account, and includes:

       o Validating the extension schema.

       o Determining  which  handlers, if any, have been specified for the ex-
         tension.

       o Making the extension available for use in your account.

       For more information about how to develop extensions and ready them for
       registration, see Creating Resource Providers in the CloudFormation CLI
       User Guide .

       You can have a maximum of 50 resource extension versions registered  at
       a  time. This maximum is per account and per Region. Use DeregisterType
       to deregister specific extension versions if necessary.

       Once you have initiated a registration request  using   RegisterType  ,
       you  can  use   DescribeTypeRegistration to monitor the progress of the
       registration request.

       Once you have registered a private extension in your  account  and  Re-
       gion,  use SetTypeConfiguration to specify configuration properties for
       the extension. For more information, see Configuring extensions at  the
       account level in the CloudFormation User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          The kind of extension.

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

          o HOOK

       --type-name (string)
          The name of the extension being registered.

          We suggest that extension names adhere to the following patterns:

          o For resource types, company_or_organization ::service ::type .

          o For modules, company_or_organization ::service ::type ::MODULE.

          o For hooks, MyCompany ::Testing ::MyTestHook .

          NOTE:
              The  following organization namespaces are reserved and can't be
              used in your extension names:

              o Alexa

              o AMZN

              o Amazon

              o AWS

              o Custom

              o Dev

       --schema-handler-package (string)
          A URL to the S3 bucket containing the extension project package that
          contains the necessary files for the extension you want to register.

          For  information  about  generating a schema handler package for the
          extension you want to register, see submit in the CloudFormation CLI
          User Guide .

          NOTE:
              The  user  registering  the extension must be able to access the
              package in the  S3  bucket.  That's,  the  user  needs  to  have
              GetObject  permissions  for the schema handler package. For more
              information, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Ama-
              zon S3 in the Identity and Access Management User Guide .

       --logging-config (structure)
          Specifies logging configuration information for an extension.

          LogRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the role that CloudFormation
              should assume when sending log entries to CloudWatch Logs.

          LogGroupName -> (string)
              The Amazon CloudWatch Logs group to which  CloudFormation  sends
              error  logging  information  when  invoking the extension's han-
              dlers.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LogRoleArn=string,LogGroupName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LogRoleArn": "string",
            "LogGroupName": "string"
          }

       --execution-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for CloudFormation to
          assume when invoking the extension.

          For  CloudFormation to assume the specified execution role, the role
          must contain a trust relationship with  the  CloudFormation  service
          principal (resources.cloudformation.amazonaws.com ). For more infor-
          mation about adding trust relationships, see Modifying a role  trust
          policy in the Identity and Access Management User Guide .

          If  your extension calls Amazon Web Services APIs in any of its han-
          dlers, you must create an * IAM execution role * that  includes  the
          necessary  permissions  to  call those Amazon Web Services APIs, and
          provision that execution role in your account.  When  CloudFormation
          needs  to  invoke  the resource type handler, CloudFormation assumes
          this execution role to create a temporary session  token,  which  it
          then passes to the resource type handler, thereby supplying your re-
          source type with the appropriate credentials.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier that acts as an idempotency key for this  regis-
          tration  request.  Specifying a client request token prevents Cloud-
          Formation from generating more than one version of an extension from
          the same registration request, even if the request is submitted mul-
          tiple times.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To register a resource type

       The  following  register-type  example registers the specified resource
       type as a private resource type in the user's account.

          aws cloudformation register-type \
              --type-name My::Organization::ResourceName \
              --schema-handler-package s3://bucket_name/my-organization-resource_name.zip \
              --type RESOURCE

       Output:

          {
              "RegistrationToken": "f5525280-104e-4d35-bef5-8f1f1example"
          }

       For more information, see Registering Resource Providers in the  Cloud-
       Formation Command Line Interface User Guide for Type Development.

OUTPUT
       RegistrationToken -> (string)
          The identifier for this registration request.

          Use this registration token when calling  DescribeTypeRegistration ,
          which returns information about the status and IDs of the  extension
          registration.
