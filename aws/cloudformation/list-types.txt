LIST-TYPES()                                                      LIST-TYPES()



NAME
       list-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  summary  information about extension that have been registered
       with CloudFormation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-types is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: TypeSummaries

OPTIONS
       --visibility (string)
          The  scope  at which the extensions are visible and usable in Cloud-
          Formation operations.

          Valid values include:

          o PRIVATE : Extensions that are visible and usable within  this  ac-
            count and Region. This includes:

            o Private  extensions  you have registered in this account and Re-
              gion.

            o Public extensions that you have activated in  this  account  and
              Region.

          o PUBLIC  : Extensions that are publicly visible and available to be
            activated within any Amazon Web Services  account.  This  includes
            extensions  from  Amazon  Web Services, in addition to third-party
            publishers.

          The default is PRIVATE .

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC

          o PRIVATE

       --provisioning-type (string)
          For resource types, the provisioning behavior of the resource  type.
          CloudFormation determines the provisioning type during registration,
          based on the types of handlers in the schema handler package submit-
          ted.

          Valid values include:

          o FULLY_MUTABLE  :  The  resource type includes an update handler to
            process updates to the type during stack update operations.

          o IMMUTABLE : The resource type doesn't include an  update  handler,
            so  the  type can't be updated and must instead be replaced during
            stack update operations.

          o NON_PROVISIONABLE : The  resource  type  doesn't  include  create,
            read,  and delete handlers, and therefore can't actually be provi-
            sioned.

          The default is FULLY_MUTABLE .

          Possible values:

          o NON_PROVISIONABLE

          o IMMUTABLE

          o FULLY_MUTABLE

       --deprecated-status (string)
          The deprecation status of the extension that you want to get summary
          information about.

          Valid values include:

          o LIVE : The extension is registered for use in CloudFormation oper-
            ations.

          o DEPRECATED : The extension has been deregistered and can no longer
            be used in CloudFormation operations.

          Possible values:

          o LIVE

          o DEPRECATED

       --type (string)
          The type of extension.

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

          o HOOK

       --filters (structure)
          Filter criteria to use in determining which extensions to return.

          Filters  must be compatible with Visibility to return valid results.
          For example, specifying AWS_TYPES for Category and PRIVATE for Visi-
          bility  returns  an  empty  list of types, but specifying PUBLIC for
          Visibility returns the desired list.

          Category -> (string)
              The category of extensions to return.

              o REGISTERED : Private extensions that have been registered  for
                this account and Region.

              o ACTIVATED  :  Public  extensions  that have been activated for
                this account and Region.

              o THIRD_PARTY : Extensions available  for  use  from  publishers
                other than Amazon. This includes:

                o Private extensions registered in the account.

                o Public extensions from publishers other than Amazon, whether
                  activated or not.

              o AWS_TYPES : Extensions available for use from Amazon.

          PublisherId -> (string)
              The id of the publisher of the extension.

              Extensions published by Amazon aren't assigned a  publisher  ID.
              Use  the AWS_TYPES category to specify a list of types published
              by Amazon.

          TypeNamePrefix -> (string)
              A prefix to use as a filter for results.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Category=string,PublisherId=string,TypeNamePrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Category": "REGISTERED"|"ACTIVATED"|"THIRD_PARTY"|"AWS_TYPES",
            "PublisherId": "string",
            "TypeNamePrefix": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       TypeSummaries -> (list)
          A  list of TypeSummary structures that contain information about the
          specified extensions.

          (structure)
              Contains summary information about the specified  CloudFormation
              extension.

              Type -> (string)
                 The kind of extension.

              TypeName -> (string)
                 The name of the extension.

                 If  you  specified a TypeNameAlias when you activate this ex-
                 tension in your account and Region, CloudFormation  considers
                 that alias as the type name.

              DefaultVersionId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the default version of the extension. The default
                 version is used when the extension version isn't specified.

                 This applies only to private extensions you  have  registered
                 in  your  account. For public extensions, both those provided
                 by Amazon and published by third parties, CloudFormation  re-
                 turns null . For more information, see RegisterType .

                 To  set  the default version of an extension, use  SetTypeDe-
                 faultVersion .

              TypeArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

              LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 When the specified extension version was registered. This ap-
                 plies only to:

                 o Private extensions you have registered in your account. For
                   more information, see RegisterType .

                 o Public extensions you have activated in your  account  with
                   auto-update    specified.   For   more   information,   see
                   ActivateType .

                 For all other extension types, CloudFormation returns null .

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the extension.

              PublisherId -> (string)
                 The ID of the extension publisher, if the extension  is  pub-
                 lished by a third party. Extensions published by Amazon don't
                 return a publisher ID.

              OriginalTypeName -> (string)
                 For public extensions that have been activated for  this  ac-
                 count and Region, the type name of the public extension.

                 If  you specified a TypeNameAlias when enabling the extension
                 in this account and Region, CloudFormation treats that  alias
                 as  the  extension's type name within the account and Region,
                 not the type name of the public extension. For more  informa-
                 tion,  see  Specifying  aliases to refer to extensions in the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              PublicVersionNumber -> (string)
                 For public extensions that have been activated for  this  ac-
                 count  and  Region, the version of the public extension to be
                 used for CloudFormation operations in this  account  and  Re-
                 gion.

                 How  you specified AutoUpdate when enabling the extension af-
                 fects whether CloudFormation automatically updates the exten-
                 sion  in  this  account  and Region when a new version is re-
                 leased. For more information, see Setting  CloudFormation  to
                 automatically use new versions of extensions in the CloudFor-
                 mation User Guide .

              LatestPublicVersion -> (string)
                 For public extensions that have been activated for  this  ac-
                 count  and Region, the latest version of the public extension
                 that is available . For any extensions other  than  activated
                 third-arty extensions, CloudFormation returns null .

                 How  you specified AutoUpdate when enabling the extension af-
                 fects whether CloudFormation automatically updates the exten-
                 sion  in  this  account  and Region when a new version is re-
                 leased. For more information, see Setting  CloudFormation  to
                 automatically use new versions of extensions in the CloudFor-
                 mation User Guide .

              PublisherIdentity -> (string)
                 The service used to verify the publisher identity.

                 For more information, see Registering your account to publish
                 CloudFormation  extensions  in the CFN-CLI User Guide for Ex-
                 tension Development .

              PublisherName -> (string)
                 The publisher name, as defined in the public profile for that
                 publisher  in  the service used to verify the publisher iden-
                 tity.

              IsActivated -> (boolean)
                 Whether the extension is activated for this account  and  Re-
                 gion.

                 This  applies  only  to third-party public extensions. Exten-
                 sions published by Amazon are activated by default.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all the remaining  results,  NextToken
          is  set  to  a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this
          action again and assign that token to the request object's NextToken
          parameter.  If  the request returns all results, NextToken is set to
          null .



                                                                  LIST-TYPES()
