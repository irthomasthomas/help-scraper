LIST-STACK-SETS()                                            LIST-STACK-SETS()



NAME
       list-stack-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  summary  information about stack sets that are associated with
       the user.

       o [Self-managed permissions] If you set the CallAs  parameter  to  SELF
         while  signed  in  to your Amazon Web Services account, ListStackSets
         returns all self-managed stack sets in your Amazon Web  Services  ac-
         count.

       o [Service-managed permissions] If you set the CallAs parameter to SELF
         while signed in to the organization's management account,  ListStack-
         Sets returns all stack sets in the management account.

       o [Service-managed permissions] If you set the CallAs parameter to DEL-
         EGATED_ADMIN while signed in to your  member  account,  ListStackSets
         returns  all  stack sets with service-managed permissions in the man-
         agement account.

       list-stack-sets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Summaries

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          The  status  of the stack sets that you want to get summary informa-
          tion about.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o DELETED

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account  administrator  in  the management account or as a delegated
          administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          aws cloudformation list-stack-sets

       Output:

          {
              "Summaries": [
                  {
                      "StackSetName": "enable-config",
                      "StackSetId": "enable-config:296a3360-xmpl-40af-be78-9341e95bf743",
                      "Description": "Enable AWS Config",
                      "Status": "ACTIVE"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A list of StackSetSummary structures that contain information  about
          the user's stack sets.

          (structure)
              The structures that contain summary information about the speci-
              fied stack set.

              StackSetName -> (string)
                 The name of the stack set.

              StackSetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack set.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the stack set  that  you  specify  when  the
                 stack set is created or updated.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the stack set.

              AutoDeployment -> (structure)
                 [Service-managed permissions] Describes whether StackSets au-
                 tomatically deploys to Organizations accounts that are  added
                 to a target organizational unit (OU).

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     If  set  to  true , StackSets automatically deploys addi-
                     tional stack instances to Organizations accounts that are
                     added  to  a  target  organization or organizational unit
                     (OU) in the specified Regions. If an account  is  removed
                     from a target organization or OU, StackSets deletes stack
                     instances from the account in the specified Regions.

                 RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval -> (boolean)
                     If set to true , stack resources are retained when an ac-
                     count is removed from a target organization or OU. If set
                     to false , stack resources are deleted. Specify  only  if
                     Enabled is set to True .

              PermissionModel -> (string)
                 Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations
                 are created.

                 o With self-managed permissions, you must create the adminis-
                   trator and execution roles required to deploy to target ac-
                   counts. For more information, see Grant Self-Managed  Stack
                   Set Permissions .

                 o With  service-managed  permissions, StackSets automatically
                   creates the IAM roles required to deploy to  accounts  man-
                   aged by Organizations. For more information, see Grant Ser-
                   vice-Managed Stack Set Permissions .

              DriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status of the stack set's actual  configuration  compared  to
                 its  expected  template  and parameter configuration. A stack
                 set is considered to have drifted if one or more of its stack
                 instances  have  drifted from their expected template and pa-
                 rameter configuration.

                 o DRIFTED : One or more of the stack instances  belonging  to
                   the  stack set stack differs from the expected template and
                   parameter configuration. A stack instance is considered  to
                   have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associ-
                   ated stack have drifted.

                 o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation hasn't checked the  stack  set
                   for drift.

                 o IN_SYNC  :  All  the stack instances belonging to the stack
                   set stack match from the expected  template  and  parameter
                   configuration.

                 o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

              LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detec-
                 tion operation on the stack set. This value will be NULL  for
                 any  stack  set on which drift detection hasn't yet been per-
                 formed.

              ManagedExecution -> (structure)
                 Describes whether StackSets performs  non-conflicting  opera-
                 tions concurrently and queues conflicting operations.

                 Active -> (boolean)
                     When true , StackSets performs non-conflicting operations
                     concurrently and  queues  conflicting  operations.  After
                     conflicting  operations  finish,  StackSets starts queued
                     operations in request order.

                     NOTE:
                        If there are already  running  or  queued  operations,
                        StackSets  queues all incoming operations even if they
                        are non-conflicting.

                        You can't modify your stack set's execution configura-
                        tion  while there are running or queued operations for
                        that stack set.

                     When false (default), StackSets performs one operation at
                     a time in request order.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the request doesn't return all of the remaining results, NextTo-
          ken is set to a token. To retrieve the next  set  of  results,  call
          ListStackInstances  again  and  assign that token to the request ob-
          ject's NextToken parameter. If  the  request  returns  all  results,
          NextToken is set to null .
