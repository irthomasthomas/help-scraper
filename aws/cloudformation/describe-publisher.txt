NAME
       describe-publisher -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a CloudFormation extension publisher.

       If  you  don't supply a PublisherId , and you have registered as an ex-
       tension publisher, DescribePublisher returns information about your own
       publisher account.

       For more information about registering as a publisher, see:

       o RegisterPublisher

       o Publishing  extensions  to  make them available for public use in the
         CloudFormation CLI User Guide

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-publisher
          [--publisher-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --publisher-id (string)
          The ID of the extension publisher.

          If you don't supply a PublisherId , and you have  registered  as  an
          extension  publisher,  DescribePublisher  returns  information about
          your own publisher account.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
