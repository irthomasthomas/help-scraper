NAME
       list-stack-instance-resource-drifts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns drift information for resources in a stack instance.

       NOTE:
          ListStackInstanceResourceDrifts  returns  drift  information for the
          most recent  drift  detection  operation.  If  an  operation  is  in
          progress, it may only return partial results.

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to list drifted
          resources for.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining
          results, the response object's NextToken parameter value is set to a
          token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this  action  again
          and  assign  that token to the request object's NextToken parameter.
          If there are no remaining results, the  previous  response  object's
          NextToken parameter is set to null .

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If
          the number of available results exceeds this maximum,  the  response
          includes  a NextToken value that you can assign to the NextToken re-
          quest parameter to get the next set of results.

       --stack-instance-resource-drift-statuses (list)
          The resource drift status of the stack instance.

          o DELETED : The resource differs from its expected template configu-
            ration in that the resource has been deleted.

          o MODIFIED  :  One or more resource properties differ from their ex-
            pected template values.

          o IN_SYNC : The resource's actual configuration matches its expected
            template configuration.

          o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation doesn't currently return this value.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            IN_SYNC
            MODIFIED
            DELETED
            NOT_CHECKED

       --stack-instance-account (string)
          The  name  of  the Amazon Web Services account that you want to list
          resource drifts for.

       --stack-instance-region (string)
          The name of the Region where you want to list resource drifts.

       --operation-id (string)
          The unique ID of the drift operation.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT

          A list of StackInstanceResourceDriftsSummary structures that contain
          information about the specified stack instances.

          (structure)
              The structure  containing  summary  information  about  resource
              drifts for a stack instance.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack instance.

              LogicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

              PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The  name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical

                 Context information that enables CloudFormation  to  uniquely
                 identify  a  resource.  CloudFormation uses context key-value
                 pairs in cases where a resource's logical  and  physical  IDs
                 aren't  enough  to uniquely identify that resource. Each con-
                 text key-value pair specifies a unique resource that contains
                 the targeted resource.

                 (structure)
                     Context   information   that  enables  CloudFormation  to
                     uniquely identify a resource. CloudFormation uses context
                     key-value  pairs  in cases where a resource's logical and
                     physical IDs aren't enough to uniquely identify that  re-
                     source.  Each context key-value pair specifies a resource
                     that contains the targeted resource.

                     Key -> (string)

                     differs from its expected value, as defined in the  stack
                     template and any values specified as template parameters.
                     These will be present only for resources  whose  StackRe-
                     sourceDriftStatus is MODIFIED . For more information, see
                     Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and  re-
                     sources with drift detection .

                     PropertyPath -> (string)
                        The fully-qualified path to the resource property.

                     ExpectedValue -> (string)
                        The  expected property value of the resource property,
                        as defined in the stack template and any values speci-

                          rent resource configuration.

                        o NOT_EQUAL  : The current property value differs from
                          its expected value (as defined in the stack template
                          and any values specified as template parameters).

              StackResourceDriftStatus -> (string)
                 The drift status of the resource in a stack instance.

                 o DELETED  :  The resource differs from its expected template
                   configuration in that the resource has been deleted.

                 o MODIFIED : One or  more  resource  properties  differ  from
                   their expected template values.

                 o IN_SYNC  :  The resource's actual configuration matches its

          If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining
          results, the response object's NextToken parameter value is set to a
          token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this  action  again
          and  assign  that token to the request object's NextToken parameter.
