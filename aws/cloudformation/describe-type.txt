OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          The kind of extension.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

          o HOOK

       --type-name (string)
          The name of the extension.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

       --version-id (string)
          The ID of a specific version of the extension. The version ID is the
          value  at  the end of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) assigned to the
          extension version when it is registered.

          If you specify a VersionId , DescribeType returns information  about
          that  specific  extension version. Otherwise, it returns information
          about the default extension version.

       --publisher-id (string)
          The publisher ID of the extension publisher.

          Extensions provided by Amazon Web Services are not assigned  a  pub-
          lisher ID.

       --public-version-number (string)
          The version number of a public third-party extension.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To display type information

       The following describe-type example displays information for the speci-
       fied type.

          aws cloudformation describe-type \
              --type-name My::Logs::LogGroup \
              --type RESOURCE

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

       Type -> (string)
          The kind of extension.

       TypeName -> (string)
          The name of the extension.

          If  the  extension  is  a public third-party type you have activated
          with a type name alias, CloudFormation returns the type name  alias.
          For       more       information,       see      `      ActivateType
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html`__
          .

       DefaultVersionId -> (string)
          The  ID of the default version of the extension. The default version
          is used when the extension version isn't specified.

          This applies only to private extensions you have registered in  your
          account.  For  public  extensions, both those provided by Amazon Web
          Services and published by third parties, CloudFormation returns null
          .      For      more     information,     see     `     RegisterType
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html`__
          .

          To  set the default version of an extension, use  SetTypeDefaultVer-
          sion .

       IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
          Whether the specified extension version is set as the  default  ver-
          sion.

          This  applies only to private extensions you have registered in your
          account, and extensions published by Amazon Web Services. For public
          third-party  extensions, whether they are activated in your account,
          CloudFormation returns null .

       TypeTestsStatus -> (string)
          The contract test status of the registered extension version. To re-
          turn  the extension test status of a specific extension version, you
          must specify VersionId .

          This applies only to registered private extension  versions.  Cloud-
          Formation  doesn't  return  this  information for public extensions,
          whether they are activated in your account.

          o PASSED : The extension has passed all its contract tests.  An  ex-
            tension  must  have  a test status of PASSED before it can be pub-
            lished. For more information, see Publishing  extensions  to  make
            them  available  for public use in the CloudFormation Command Line
            Interface User Guide .

          o FAILED : The extension has failed one or more contract tests.

          o IN_PROGRESS : Contract tests are currently being performed on  the
            extension.

          o NOT_TESTED  :  Contract tests haven't been performed on the exten-
            sion.

       TypeTestsStatusDescription -> (string)
          The description of the test status. To  return  the  extension  test
          status of a specific extension version, you must specify VersionId .

          This  applies  only to registered private extension versions. Cloud-
          Formation doesn't return this  information  for  public  extensions,
          whether they are activated in your account.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the extension.

       Schema -> (string)
          The schema that defines the extension.

          For  more information about extension schemas, see Resource Provider
          Schema in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide .

       ProvisioningType -> (string)
          For resource type extensions, the provisioning behavior of  the  re-
          source  type. CloudFormation determines the provisioning type during
          registration, based on the types of handlers in the  schema  handler
          package submitted.

          Valid values include:

          o FULLY_MUTABLE  :  The  resource type includes an update handler to
            process updates to the type during stack update operations.

          o IMMUTABLE : The resource type doesn't include an  update  handler,
            so  the  type can't be updated and must instead be replaced during
            stack update operations.

          o NON_PROVISIONABLE : The resource type doesn't include all the fol-
            lowing handlers, and therefore can't actually be provisioned.

            o create

            o read

            o delete

       DeprecatedStatus -> (string)
          The deprecation status of the extension version.

          Valid values include:

          o LIVE : The extension is activated or registered and can be used in
            CloudFormation operations, dependent on its provisioning  behavior
            and visibility scope.

          o DEPRECATED  :  The  extension has been deactivated or deregistered
            and can no longer be used in CloudFormation operations.

          For public third-party extensions, CloudFormation returns null .

       LoggingConfig -> (structure)
          Contains logging configuration information for  private  extensions.
          This  applies only to private extensions you have registered in your
          account. For public extensions, both those provided  by  Amazon  Web
          Services and published by third parties, CloudFormation returns null
          .     For     more     information,     see      `      RegisterType
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html`__
          .

          LogRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role  that  CloudFormation
              should assume when sending log entries to CloudWatch Logs.

          LogGroupName -> (string)
              The  Amazon  CloudWatch Logs group to which CloudFormation sends
              error logging information when  invoking  the  extension's  han-
              dlers.

       RequiredActivatedTypes -> (list)
          For  extensions  that are modules, the public third-party extensions
          that must be activated in your account in order for the  module  it-
          self to be activated.

          (structure)
              For  extensions that are modules, a public third-party extension
              that must be activated in your account in order for  the  module
              itself to be activated.

              For  more  information, see Activating public modules for use in
              your account in the CloudFormation User Guide .

              TypeNameAlias -> (string)
                 An alias assigned to the public extension,  in  this  account
                 and Region. If you specify an alias for the extension, Cloud-
                 Formation treats the alias as the extension type name  within
                 this  account  and Region. You must use the alias to refer to
                 the extension in your templates, API calls,  and  CloudForma-
                 tion console.

              OriginalTypeName -> (string)
                 The type name of the public extension.

                 If  you specified a TypeNameAlias when enabling the extension
                 in this account and Region, CloudFormation treats that  alias
                 as  the  extension's type name within the account and Region,
                 not the type name of the public extension. For more  informa-
                 tion,  see  Specifying  aliases to refer to extensions in the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              PublisherId -> (string)
                 The publisher ID of the extension publisher.

              SupportedMajorVersions -> (list)
                 A list of the major versions of the extension type  that  the
                 macro supports.

                 (integer)

       ExecutionRoleArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM execution role used to
          register the extension. This applies only to private extensions  you
          have  registered in your account. For more information, see ` Regis-
          terType
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html`__
          .

          If the registered extension calls any Amazon Web Services APIs,  you
          must  create  an  * IAM execution role * that includes the necessary
          permissions to call those Amazon Web Services  APIs,  and  provision
          that  execution  role  in  your account. CloudFormation then assumes
          that execution role to provide your extension with  the  appropriate
          credentials.

       Visibility -> (string)
          The  scope at which the extension is visible and usable in CloudFor-
          mation operations.

          Valid values include:

          o PRIVATE : The extension is only visible and usable within the  ac-
            count  in  which it is registered. CloudFormation marks any exten-
            sions you register as PRIVATE .

          o PUBLIC : The extension is publicly visible and usable  within  any
            Amazon Web Services account.

       SourceUrl -> (string)
          The URL of the source code for the extension.

       DocumentationUrl -> (string)
          The  URL  of a page providing detailed documentation for this exten-
          sion.

       LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
          When the specified extension version was  registered.  This  applies
          only to:

          o Private  extensions  you have registered in your account. For more
            information,            see             `             RegisterType
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html`__
            .

          o Public extensions you have activated in your account with auto-up-
            date   specified.   For   more  information,  see  `  ActivateType
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html`__
            .

       TimeCreated -> (timestamp)
          When the specified private extension version was registered or acti-
          vated in your account.

       ConfigurationSchema -> (string)
          A JSON string that represent the current configuration data for  the
          extension in this account and Region.

          To set the configuration data for an extension, use ` SetTypeConfig-
          uration
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_SetTypeConfiguration.html`__
          . For more information, see Configuring extensions  at  the  account
          level in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       PublisherId -> (string)
          The publisher ID of the extension publisher.

          This applies only to public third-party extensions. For private reg-
          istered extensions, and extensions provided by Amazon Web  Services,
          CloudFormation returns null .

       OriginalTypeName -> (string)
          For  public extensions that have been activated for this account and
          Region, the type name of the public extension.

          If you specified a TypeNameAlias when enabling the extension in this
          account  and  Region, CloudFormation treats that alias as the exten-
          sion's type name within the account and Region, not the type name of
          the  public  extension. For more information, see Specifying aliases
          to refer to extensions in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       OriginalTypeArn -> (string)
          For public extensions that have been activated for this account  and
          Region, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the public extension.

       PublicVersionNumber -> (string)
          The version number of a public third-party extension.

          This  applies  only if you specify a public extension you have acti-
          vated in your account, or specify a public extension without  speci-
          fying  a  version.  For all other extensions, CloudFormation returns
          null .

       LatestPublicVersion -> (string)
          The latest version of a public extension that is available for use.

          This only applies if you specify a public extension, and  you  don't
          specify  a  version.  For all other requests, CloudFormation returns
          null .

       IsActivated -> (boolean)
          Whether the extension is activated in the account and Region.

          This only applies to public third-party extensions.  For  all  other
          extensions, CloudFormation returns null .

       AutoUpdate -> (boolean)
          Whether  CloudFormation  automatically updates the extension in this
          account and Region when a new minor version is published by the  ex-
          tension  publisher. Major versions released by the publisher must be
          manually updated. For more information, see Activating public exten-
          sions for use in your account in the CloudFormation User Guide .
