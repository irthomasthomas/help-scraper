LIST-STACK-SET-OPERATION-RESULTS()          LIST-STACK-SET-OPERATION-RESULTS()



NAME
       list-stack-set-operation-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns summary information about the results of a stack set operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-stack-set-operation-results is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: Summaries

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to  get  opera-
          tion results for.

       --operation-id (string)
          The ID of the stack set operation.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list stack set operation results

       The  following  command  displays the results of an update operation on
       instances in the specified stack set.

          aws cloudformation list-stack-set-operation-results \
              --stack-set-name enable-config \
              --operation-id 35d45ebc-ed88-xmpl-ab59-0197a1fc83a0

       Output:

          {
              "Summaries": [
                  {
                      "Account": "223456789012",
                      "Region": "us-west-2",
                      "Status": "SUCCEEDED",
                      "AccountGateResult": {
                          "Status": "SKIPPED",
                          "StatusReason": "Function not found: arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:223456789012:function:AWSCloudFormationStackSetAccountGate"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "Account": "223456789012",
                      "Region": "ap-south-1",
                      "Status": "CANCELLED",
                      "StatusReason": "Cancelled since failure tolerance has exceeded"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Note: The SKIPPED status for AccountGateResult is expected for success-
       ful operations unless you create an account gate function.

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A list of StackSetOperationResultSummary structures that contain in-
          formation about the specified operation results,  for  accounts  and
          Amazon Web Services Regions that are included in the operation.

          (structure)
              The structure that contains information about a specified opera-
              tion's results for a given account in a given Region.

              Account -> (string)
                 [Self-managed permissions] The name of the  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices account for this operation result.

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Web Services Region for this operation
                 result.

              Status -> (string)
                 The result status of the stack set operation  for  the  given
                 account in the given Region.

                 o CANCELLED  : The operation in the specified account and Re-
                   gion has been canceled. This is either because a  user  has
                   stopped  the  stack  set  operation, or because the failure
                   tolerance of the stack set operation has been exceeded.

                 o FAILED : The operation in the specified account and  Region
                   failed. If the stack set operation fails in enough accounts
                   within a Region, the failure tolerance for  the  stack  set
                   operation as a whole might be exceeded.

                 o RUNNING : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   is currently in progress.

                 o PENDING : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   has yet to start.

                 o SUCCEEDED  : The operation in the specified account and Re-
                   gion completed successfully.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 The reason for the assigned result status.

              AccountGateResult -> (structure)
                 The results of the account gate function  CloudFormation  in-
                 vokes,  if  present,  before proceeding with stack set opera-
                 tions in an account.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the account gate function.

                     o SUCCEEDED : The account gate  function  has  determined
                       that the account and Region passes any requirements for
                       a stack set operation to occur. CloudFormation proceeds
                       with the stack operation in that account and Region.

                     o FAILED  : The account gate function has determined that
                       the account and Region doesn't  meet  the  requirements
                       for a stack set operation to occur. CloudFormation can-
                       cels the stack set operation in that  account  and  Re-
                       gion,  and  sets  the stack set operation result status
                       for that account and Region to FAILED .

                     o SKIPPED : CloudFormation has skipped  calling  the  ac-
                       count  gate  function  for this account and Region, for
                       one of the following reasons:

                       o An account gate function hasn't  been  specified  for
                         the  account and Region. CloudFormation proceeds with
                         the stack set operation in this account and Region.

                       o The  AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole  of   the
                         stack set administration account lacks permissions to
                         invoke the function. CloudFormation proceeds with the
                         stack set operation in this account and Region.

                       o Either no action is necessary, or no action is possi-
                         ble, on the stack. CloudFormation skips the stack set
                         operation in this account and Region.

                 StatusReason -> (string)
                     The  reason  for the account gate status assigned to this
                     account and Region for the stack set operation.

              OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
                 [Service-managed permissions] The organization root ID or or-
                 ganizational   unit   (OU)   IDs   that   you  specified  for
                 DeploymentTargets .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all results, NextToken is set to a to-
          ken.  To retrieve the next set of results, call ListOperationResults
          again and assign that token to the request object's NextToken param-
          eter. If there are no remaining results, NextToken is set to null .
