OPTIONS
       --generated-template-name (string)
          The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a generated template.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GeneratedTemplateId -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the generated template. The format
          is     arn:${Partition}:cloudformation:${Region}:${Account}:generat-
          edtemplate/${Id} . For example,
          ``
          arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1     :123456789012    :generatedtem-
          plate/2e8465c1-9a80-43ea-a3a3-4f2d692fe6dc `` .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 158)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       GeneratedTemplateName -> (string)
          The name of the generated template.

       Resources -> (list)
          A list of objects describing the details of  the  resources  in  the
          template generation.

          (structure)
              Details about a resource in a generated template

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type of the resource, such as AWS::DynamoDB::Table . For
                 the list of supported resources, see IaC generator  supported
                 resource types In the CloudFormation User Guide

              LogicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The  logical id for this resource in the final generated tem-
                 plate.

              ResourceIdentifier -> (map)
                 A list of up to 256 key-value pairs that identifies  the  re-
                 source  in the generated template. The key is the name of one
                 of the primary identifiers for the resource. (Primary identi-
                 fiers  are specified in the primaryIdentifier list in the re-
                 source schema.) The value is the value of that primary  iden-
                 tifier. For example, for a AWS::DynamoDB::Table resource, the
                 primary identifiers is TableName so the key-value pair  could
                 be  "TableName":  "MyDDBTable"  .  For  more information, see
                 primaryIdentifier in the CloudFormation Command  Line  Inter-
                 face User guide for extension development .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              ResourceStatus -> (string)
                 Status  of  the  processing of a resource in a generated tem-
                 plate.
                     InProgress

                 The resource processing is still in progress.
                     Complete

                 The resource processing is complete.
                     Pending

                 The resource processing is pending.
                     Failed

                 The resource processing has failed.

              ResourceStatusReason -> (string)
                 The reason for the resource detail, providing  more  informa-
                 tion if a failure happened.

              Warnings -> (list)
                 The warnings generated for this resource.

                 (structure)
                     The  warnings  generated for a specific resource for this
                     generated template.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of this warning. For  more  information,  see
                        IaC  generator and write-only properties in the Cloud-
                        Formation User Guide .

                        o MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE_PROPERTIES  -  The  resource  re-
                          quires mutually-exclusive write-only properties. The
                          IaC generator selects one set of mutually  exclusive
                          properties and converts the included properties into
                          parameters. The parameter names have a suffix  OneOf
                          and  the  parameter  descriptions  indicate that the
                          corresponding property can be  replaced  with  other
                          exclusive properties.

                        o UNSUPPORTED_PROPERTIES  - Unsupported properties are
                          present in the resource. One example of  unsupported
                          properties  would  be a required write-only property
                          that is an array, because a parameter cannot  be  an
                          array.  Another  example  is  an optional write-only
                          property.

                        o MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE_TYPES  -  One  or  more  required
                          write-only properties are found in the resource, and
                          the type of that property  can  be  any  of  several
                          types.

                        NOTE:
                            Currently the resource and property reference doc-
                            umentation does not indicate if a property uses  a
                            type  of  oneOf or anyOf . You need to look at the
                            resource provider schema.

                     Properties -> (list)
                        The properties of the resource that  are  impacted  by
                        this warning.

                        (structure)
                            A specific property that is impacted by a warning.

                            PropertyPath -> (string)
                               The  path of the property. For example, if this
                               is for the S3Bucket member of  the  Code  prop-
                               erty,  the property path would be Code/S3Bucket
                               .

                            Required -> (boolean)
                               If true , the specified property is required.
