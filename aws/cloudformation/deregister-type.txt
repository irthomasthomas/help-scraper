DEREGISTER-TYPE()                                            DEREGISTER-TYPE()



NAME
       deregister-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Marks  an extension or extension version as DEPRECATED in the CloudFor-
       mation registry, removing it from active use. Deprecated extensions  or
       extension versions cannot be used in CloudFormation operations.

       To deregister an entire extension, you must individually deregister all
       active versions of that extension. If an extension has  only  a  single
       active version, deregistering that version results in the extension it-
       self being deregistered and marked as deprecated in the registry.

       You can't deregister the default version of an extension if  there  are
       other  active  version  of that extension. If you do deregister the de-
       fault version of an extension, the extension type  itself  is  deregis-
       tered as well and marked as deprecated.

       To  view  the  deprecation status of an extension or extension version,
       use DescribeType .

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

       --type (string)
          The kind of extension.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

          o HOOK

       --type-name (string)
          The name of the extension.

          Conditional: You must specify either TypeName and Type , or Arn .

       --version-id (string)
          The ID of a specific version of the extension. The version ID is the
          value  at  the end of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) assigned to the
          extension version when it is registered.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To deregister a type version

       The following deregister-type example removes the specified  type  ver-
       sion  from active use in the CloudFormation registry, so that it can no
       longer be used in CloudFormation operations.

          aws cloudformation deregister-type \
              --type RESOURCE \
              --type-name My::Logs::LogGroup \
              --version-id 00000002

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Using the CloudFormation Registry in the  AWS
       CloudFormation Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
