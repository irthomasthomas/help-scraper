LIST-STACKS()                                                    LIST-STACKS()



NAME
       list-stacks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  summary  information  for stacks whose status matches the
       specified StackStatusFilter. Summary information for stacks  that  have
       been  deleted  is  kept  for  90 days after the stack is deleted. If no
       StackStatusFilter is specified, summary information for all  stacks  is
       returned (including existing stacks and stacks that have been deleted).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-stacks  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: StackSummaries

OPTIONS
       --stack-status-filter (list)
          Stack status to use as a filter. Specify one or  more  stack  status
          codes  to  list  only  stacks with the specified status codes. For a
          complete list of stack status codes, see the  StackStatus  parameter
          of the  Stack data type.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
            CREATE_FAILED
            CREATE_COMPLETE
            ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS
            ROLLBACK_FAILED
            ROLLBACK_COMPLETE
            DELETE_IN_PROGRESS
            DELETE_FAILED
            DELETE_COMPLETE
            UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS
            UPDATE_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS
            UPDATE_COMPLETE
            UPDATE_FAILED
            UPDATE_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS
            UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED
            UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS
            UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE
            REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS
            IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS
            IMPORT_COMPLETE
            IMPORT_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS
            IMPORT_ROLLBACK_FAILED
            IMPORT_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list AWS CloudFormation stacks

       The  following  list-stacks  command shows a summary of all stacks that
       have a status of CREATE_COMPLETE:

          aws cloudformation list-stacks --stack-status-filter CREATE_COMPLETE

       Output:

                 Unique stack identifier.

              StackName -> (string)

                 returned if the stack has been updated at least once.

              DeletionTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the stack was deleted.

              StackStatus -> (string)

                 stack--the stack ID of the direct parent of this  stack.  For
                 the  first level of nested stacks, the root stack is also the
                 parent stack.

                 For  nested  stacks--stacks  created as resources for another
                 stack--the stack ID of  the  top-level  stack  to  which  the
                 nested stack ultimately belongs.

                 For  more  information, see Working with Nested Stacks in the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              DriftInformation -> (structure)
                 Summarizes information about whether a stack's actual config-
                 uration  differs, or has drifted , from its expected configu-
                 ration, as defined in the stack template and any values spec-
                 ified  as  template  parameters.  For  more  information, see

                     its expected template configuration.

                     o DRIFTED : The stack differs from its expected  template
                       configuration. A stack is considered to have drifted if
                       one or more of its resources have drifted.

                     o NOT_CHECKED :  CloudFormation  hasn't  checked  if  the
                       stack differs from its expected template configuration.

                 LastCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     Most recent time when a  drift  detection  operation  was
                     initiated  on  the  stack,  or  any of its individual re-
                     sources that support drift detection.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the output exceeds 1 MB in size, a  string  that  identifies  the
          next  page  of  stacks.  If no additional page exists, this value is
