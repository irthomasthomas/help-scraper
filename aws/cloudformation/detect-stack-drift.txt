DETECT-STACK-DRIFT()                                      DETECT-STACK-DRIFT()



NAME
       detect-stack-drift -

DESCRIPTION
       Detects  whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has drifted
       , from it's expected configuration, as defined in  the  stack  template
       and  any  values specified as template parameters. For each resource in
       the stack that supports drift detection,  CloudFormation  compares  the
       actual configuration of the resource with its expected template config-
       uration. Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack  tem-
       plate  are  checked for drift. A stack is considered to have drifted if
       one or more of its resources differ from their expected  template  con-
       figurations. For more information, see Detecting Unregulated Configura-
       tion Changes to Stacks and Resources .

       Use DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all supported resources  for  a
       given stack, or  DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on individual
       resources.

       For a list of stack resources that currently support  drift  detection,
       see Resources that Support Drift Detection .
          DetectStackDrift  can  take  up to several minutes, depending on the
          number of resources contained within the stack. Use   DescribeStack-
          DriftDetectionStatus to monitor the progress of a detect stack drift
          operation. Once the drift detection  operation  has  completed,  use
          DescribeStackResourceDrifts  to  return  drift information about the
          stack and its resources.

       When detecting drift on a stack, CloudFormation doesn't detect drift on
       any nested stacks belonging to that stack. Perform DetectStackDrift di-
       rectly on the nested stack itself.

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack for which you want to detect drift.

       --logical-resource-ids (list)
          The logical names of any resources you want to use as filters.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detect drifted resources

       The following detect-stack-drift example initiates drift detection  for
       the specified stack.

          aws cloudformation detect-stack-drift \
              --stack-name my-stack

       Output:

          {
              "StackDriftDetectionId": "1a229160-e4d9-xmpl-ab67-0a4f93df83d4"
          }

       You  can  then use this ID with the describe-stack-resource-drifts com-
       mand to describe drifted resources.

OUTPUT
       StackDriftDetectionId -> (string)
          The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

          CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID,
          each  time  this  operation is run. However, the number of drift re-
          sults CloudFormation retains for any given stack, and for how  long,
          may vary.
