LIST-STACK-INSTANCES()                                  LIST-STACK-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-stack-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  summary  information about stack instances that are associated
       with the specified stack set. You can filter for stack  instances  that
       are  associated with a specific Amazon Web Services account name or Re-
       gion, or that have a specific status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-stack-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Summaries

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  or unique ID of the stack set that you want to list stack
          instances for.

       --filters (list)
          The filter to apply to stack instances

          (structure)
              The filter to apply to stack instances

              Name -> (string)
                 The type of filter to apply.

              Values -> (string)
                 The status to filter by.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "DETAILED_STATUS"|"LAST_OPERATION_ID"|"DRIFT_STATUS",
              "Values": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --stack-instance-account (string)
          The name of the Amazon Web Services account that you  want  to  list
          stack instances for.

       --stack-instance-region (string)
          The name of the Region where you want to list stack instances.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list instances for a stack

       The  following list-stack-instances example lists the instances created
       from the specified stack set.

          aws cloudformation list-stack-instances \
              --stack-set-name enable-config

       The example output includes details about a stack that failed to update
       due to an error:

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A  list  of StackInstanceSummary structures that contain information
          about the specified stack instances.

          (structure)
              The structure that contains summary information  about  a  stack
              instance.

              StackSetId -> (string)
                 The  name  or  unique  ID of the stack set that the stack in-
                 stance is associated with.

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that the stack in-
                 stance is associated with.

              Account -> (string)
                 [Self-managed  permissions]  The  name of the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices account that the stack instance is associated with.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack instance.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the stack instance, in terms  of  its  synchro-
                 nization with its associated stack set.

                 o INOPERABLE  :  A  DeleteStackInstances operation has failed
                   and left the stack in an unstable  state.  Stacks  in  this
                   state  are excluded from further UpdateStackSet operations.
                   You might need to perform a DeleteStackInstances operation,
                   with  RetainStacks  set  to  true , to delete the stack in-
                   stance, and then delete the stack manually. INOPERABLE  can
                   be returned here when the cause is a failed import. If it's
                   due to a failed import, the operation can be  retried  once
                   the  failures  are fixed. To see if this is due to a failed
                   import, call the  DescribeStackInstance API operation, look
                   at the DetailedStatus member returned in the StackInstance-
                   Summary member.

                 o OUTDATED : The stack isn't currently up to  date  with  the
                   stack set because:

                   o The  associated  stack  failed during a CreateStackSet or
                     UpdateStackSet operation.

                   o The stack was part of a CreateStackSet or  UpdateStackSet
                     operation that failed or was stopped before the stack was
                     created or updated.

                 o CURRENT : The stack is currently up to date with the  stack
                   set.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 The explanation for the specific status code assigned to this
                 stack instance.

              StackInstanceStatus -> (structure)
                 The detailed status of the stack instance.

                 DetailedStatus -> (string)

                     o CANCELLED : The operation in the specified account  and
                       Region has been canceled. This is either because a user
                       has stopped the stack set  operation,  or  because  the
                       failure  tolerance  of the stack set operation has been
                       exceeded.

                     o FAILED : The operation in the specified account and Re-
                       gion failed. If the stack set operation fails in enough
                       accounts within a Region, the failure tolerance for the
                       stack set operation as a whole might be exceeded.

                     o FAILED_IMPORT : The import of the stack instance in the
                       specified account and Region failed and left the  stack
                       in an unstable state. Once the issues causing the fail-
                       ure are fixed, the import operation can be retried.  If
                       enough  stack  set  operations  fail in enough accounts
                       within a Region, the failure tolerance  for  the  stack
                       set operation as a whole might be exceeded.

                     o INOPERABLE   :  A  DeleteStackInstances  operation  has
                       failed and left the stack in an unstable state.  Stacks
                       in  this state are excluded from further UpdateStackSet
                       operations. You might need to perform a  DeleteStackIn-
                       stances  operation,  with RetainStacks set to true , to
                       delete the stack instance, and then  delete  the  stack
                       manually.

                     o PENDING  :  The  operation in the specified account and
                       Region has yet to start.

                     o RUNNING : The operation in the  specified  account  and
                       Region is currently in progress.

                     o SKIPPED_SUSPENDED_ACCOUNT : The operation in the speci-
                       fied account and Region has been  skipped  because  the
                       account was suspended at the time of the operation.

                     o SUCCEEDED  : The operation in the specified account and
                       Region completed successfully.

              OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
                 [Service-managed permissions] The organization root ID or or-
                 ganizational   unit   (OU)   IDs   that   you  specified  for
                 DeploymentTargets .

              DriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status of the stack instance's actual configuration  compared
                 to  the  expected template and parameter configuration of the
                 stack set to which it belongs.

                 o DRIFTED : The stack differs from the expected template  and
                   parameter  configuration  of  the stack set to which it be-
                   longs. A stack instance is considered to  have  drifted  if
                   one  or  more of the resources in the associated stack have
                   drifted.

                 o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation hasn't checked  if  the  stack
                   instance differs from its expected stack set configuration.

                 o IN_SYNC : The stack instance's actual configuration matches
                   its expected stack set configuration.

                 o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

              LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detec-
                 tion operation on the stack instance. This value will be NULL
                 for any stack instance on which drift  detection  hasn't  yet
                 been performed.

              LastOperationId -> (string)
                 The  last  unique  ID  of a StackSet operation performed on a
                 stack instance.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all the remaining  results,  NextToken
          is  set  to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call List-
          StackInstances again and assign that token to the  request  object's
          NextToken  parameter.  If the request returns all results, NextToken
          is set to null .
