DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-LIMITS()                            DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-LIMITS()



NAME
       describe-account-limits -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  your  account's  CloudFormation  limits, such as the maximum
       number of stacks that you can create in your account. For more informa-
       tion about account limits, see CloudFormation Quotas in the CloudForma-
       tion User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-account-limits is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: AccountLimits

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about your account limits

       The following command retrieves a list of regional limits for the  cur-
       rent account.

          aws cloudformation describe-account-limits

       Output:

          {
              "AccountLimits": [
                  {
                      "Name": "StackLimit",
                      "Value": 200
                  },
                  {
                      "Name": "StackOutputsLimit",
                      "Value": 60
                  },
                  {
                      "Name": "ConcurrentResourcesLimit",
                      "Value": 2500
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       AccountLimits -> (list)
          An account limit structure that contain a list of CloudFormation ac-
          count limits and their values.

          (structure)
              The AccountLimit data type.

              CloudFormation has the following limits per account:

              o Number of concurrent resources

              o Number of stacks

              o Number of stack outputs

              For more information  about  these  account  limits,  and  other
              CloudFormation  limits,  see CloudFormation quotas in the Cloud-
              Formation User Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the account limit.

                 Values: ConcurrentResourcesLimit | StackLimit |  StackOutput-
                 sLimit

              Value -> (integer)
                 The value that's associated with the account limit name.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  output  exceeds  1 MB in size, a string that identifies the
          next page of limits. If no additional page  exists,  this  value  is
          null.
