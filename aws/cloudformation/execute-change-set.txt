EXECUTE-CHANGE-SET()                                      EXECUTE-CHANGE-SET()



NAME
       execute-change-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a stack using the input information that was provided when the
       specified change set was created.  After  the  call  successfully  com-
       pletes,   CloudFormation  starts  updating  the  stack.  Use  the   De-
       scribeStacks action to view the status of the update.

       When you execute a change set, CloudFormation deletes all other  change
       sets  associated  with  the stack because they aren't valid for the up-
       dated stack.

       If a stack policy is associated with the stack, CloudFormation enforces
       the  policy during the update. You can't specify a temporary stack pol-
       icy that overrides the current policy.

       To create a change set for the entire stack  hierarchy,  IncludeNested-
       Stacks must have been set to True .

OPTIONS
       --change-set-name (string)
          The  name  or  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the change set that you
          want use to update the specified stack.

       --stack-name (string)
          If you specified the name of a change set, specify the stack name or
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that's associated with the change set you
          want to execute.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this ExecuteChangeSet request. Specify  this
          token  if  you  plan  to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows
          that you're not attempting to execute a change set to update a stack
          with the same name. You might retry ExecuteChangeSet requests to en-
          sure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

       --disable-rollback | --no-disable-rollback (boolean)
          Preserves the state of previously provisioned resources when an  op-
          eration  fails.  This parameter can't be specified when the OnStack-
          Failure parameter to the CreateChangeSet API  operation  was  speci-
          fied.

          o True - if the stack creation fails, do nothing. This is equivalent
            to specifying DO_NOTHING for the OnStackFailure parameter  to  the
            CreateChangeSet API operation.

          o False  - if the stack creation fails, roll back the stack. This is
            equivalent to specifying ROLLBACK for the OnStackFailure parameter
            to the CreateChangeSet API operation.

          Default: True

       --retain-except-on-create | --no-retain-except-on-create (boolean)
          When  set to true , newly created resources are deleted when the op-
          eration rolls back. This includes  newly  created  resources  marked
          with a deletion policy of Retain .

          Default: false

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To execute a change set

       The  following  execute-change-set example executes a change set speci-
       fied by change set name and stack name.

          aws cloudformation execute-change-set \
              --change-set-name my-change-set \
              --stack-name my-stack

       The following execute-change-set example executes a change  set  speci-
       fied by the full ARN of the change set.

          aws cloudformation execute-change-set \
              --change-set-name arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:changeSet/my-change-set/bc9555ba-a949-xmpl-bfb8-f41d04ec5784

OUTPUT
       None
