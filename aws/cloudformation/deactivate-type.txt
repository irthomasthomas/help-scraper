DEACTIVATE-TYPE()                                            DEACTIVATE-TYPE()



NAME
       deactivate-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Deactivates  a  public  extension that was previously activated in this
       account and region.

       Once deactivated, an extension can't be used in any CloudFormation  op-
       eration. This includes stack update operations where the stack template
       includes the extension, even if no updates are being made to the exten-
       sion.  In addition, deactivated extensions aren't automatically updated
       if a new version of the extension is released.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deactivate-type
          [--type-name <value>]
          [--type <value>]
          [--arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The type name of the extension, in this account and region.  If  you
          specified  a  type  name  alias when enabling the extension, use the
          type name alias.

          Conditional: You must specify either Arn , or TypeName and Type .

       --type (string)
          The extension type.

          Conditional: You must specify either Arn , or TypeName and Type .

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

          o HOOK

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the extension,  in  this  account
          and region.

          Conditional: You must specify either Arn , or TypeName and Type .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
