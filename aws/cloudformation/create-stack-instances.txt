NAME
       create-stack-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  stack  instances for the specified accounts, within the speci-
       fied Amazon Web Services Regions. A stack instance refers to a stack in
       a  specific account and Region. You must specify at least one value for
       either Accounts or DeploymentTargets , and you must  specify  at  least
       one value for Regions .

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to create stack
          instances from.

       --accounts (list)
          [Self-managed permissions] The names of one or more Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices accounts that you want to create stack instances in the speci-
          fied Region(s) for.

          You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets , but not both.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deployment-targets (structure)
          [Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts  for  which
          to  create  stack instances in the specified Amazon Web Services Re-
          gions.

          You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets , but not both.

          Accounts -> (list)
              The names of one or more Amazon Web Services accounts for  which
              you want to deploy stack set updates.

              (string)

          AccountsUrl -> (string)
              Returns the value of the AccountsUrl property.

          OrganizationalUnitIds -> (list)
              The  organization  root  ID  or  organizational unit (OU) IDs to
              which StackSets deploys.

              (string)

          AccountFilterType -> (string)
              Limit deployment targets to individual accounts or include addi-
              tional accounts with provided OUs.

              The  following  is a list of possible values for the AccountFil-
              terType operation.

              o INTERSECTION : StackSets deploys to the accounts specified  in
                Accounts parameter.

              o DIFFERENCE  : StackSets excludes the accounts specified in Ac-
                counts parameter. This enables user to avoid certain  accounts
                within an OU such as suspended accounts.

              o UNION : StackSets includes additional accounts deployment tar-
                gets.  This is the default value if AccountFilterType  is  not
                provided.  This  enables user to update an entire OU and indi-
                vidual accounts from a different OU in one request, which used
                to be two separate requests.

              o NONE : Deploys to all the accounts in specified organizational
                units (OU).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Accounts=string,string,AccountsUrl=string,OrganizationalUnitIds=string,string,AccountFilterType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Accounts": ["string", ...],
            "AccountsUrl": "string",
            "OrganizationalUnitIds": ["string", ...],
            "AccountFilterType": "NONE"|"INTERSECTION"|"DIFFERENCE"|"UNION"
          }

       --regions (list)
          The names of one or more Amazon Web Services Regions where you  want
          to  create  stack  instances using the specified Amazon Web Services
          accounts.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --parameter-overrides (list)
          A list of stack set parameters whose values you want to override  in
          the selected stack instances.

          Any  overridden  parameter  values  will be applied to all stack in-
          stances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web  Services  Regions.
          When  specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how Cloud-
          Formation sets parameter values during stack instance operations:

          o To override the current value for a parameter, include the parame-
            ter and specify its value.

          o To leave an overridden parameter set to its present value, include
            the parameter and specify UsePreviousValue as true  .  (You  can't
            specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue to true .)

          o To  set an overridden parameter back to the value specified in the
            stack set, specify a parameter list but don't include the  parame-
            ter in the list.

          o To leave all parameters set to their present values, don't specify
            this property at all.

          During stack set updates, any  parameter  values  overridden  for  a
          stack instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value.

          You can only override the parameter values that are specified in the
          stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself,  use  UpdateStackSet
          to update the stack set template.

          (structure)
              The Parameter data type.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a
                 key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses
                 the default value that's specified in your template.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The input value associated with the parameter.

              UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                 During  a stack update, use the existing parameter value that
                 the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you  specify
                 true , do not specify a parameter value.

              ResolvedValue -> (string)
                 Read-only. The value that corresponds to a SSM parameter key.
                 This field is returned only for SSM parameter  types  in  the
                 template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ParameterKey=string,ParameterValue=string,UsePreviousValue=boolean,ResolvedValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ParameterKey": "string",
              "ParameterValue": "string",
              "UsePreviousValue": true|false,
              "ResolvedValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          Preferences  for  how  CloudFormation performs this stack set opera-
          tion.

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The concurrency type of deploying StackSets  operations  in  Re-
              gions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The order of the Regions where you want to perform the stack op-
              eration.

              NOTE:
                 RegionOrder isn't followed if AutoDeployment is enabled.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail  before  CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region.
              If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation  doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack op-
              eration  can  fail  before CloudFormation stops the operation in
              that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region,  CloudFor-
              mation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of accounts in which to perform this opera-
              tion at one time. This can depend on the value of  FailureToler-
              anceCount depending on your ConcurrencyMode . MaxConcurrentCount
              is at most one more than the FailureToleranceCount if you're us-
              ing STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE .

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The  maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this op-
              eration at one time.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero.  In  this  case, CloudFormation sets the number as one in-
              stead.

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          ConcurrencyMode -> (string)
              Specifies how the concurrency level behaves during the operation
              execution.

              o STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE  : This option dynamically lowers the
                concurrency level to ensure  the  number  of  failed  accounts
                never  exceeds the value of FailureToleranceCount +1. The ini-
                tial actual concurrency is set to  the  lower  of  either  the
                value  of the MaxConcurrentCount , or the value of FailureTol-
                eranceCount +1. The actual concurrency is then reduced propor-
                tionally by the number of failures. This is the default behav-
                ior. If failure tolerance or Maximum concurrent  accounts  are
                set to percentages, the behavior is similar.

              o SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE  :  This option decouples FailureToler-
                anceCount from the actual concurrency. This allows  stack  set
                operations  to run at the concurrency level set by the MaxCon-
                currentCount value, or MaxConcurrentPercentage , regardless of
                the number of failures.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionConcurrencyType=string,RegionOrder=string,string,FailureToleranceCount=integer,FailureTolerancePercentage=integer,MaxConcurrentCount=integer,MaxConcurrentPercentage=integer,ConcurrencyMode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RegionConcurrencyType": "SEQUENTIAL"|"PARALLEL",
            "RegionOrder": ["string", ...],
            "FailureToleranceCount": integer,
            "FailureTolerancePercentage": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentCount": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentPercentage": integer,
            "ConcurrencyMode": "STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE"|"SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE"
          }

       --operation-id (string)
          The unique identifier for this stack set operation.

          The  operation  ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure
          that CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even
          if  you  retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set
          operation requests to ensure that  CloudFormation  successfully  re-
          ceived them.

          If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automat-
          ically.

          Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation  ID  retries
          all stack instances whose status is OUTDATED .

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create stack instances

       The  following  create-stack-instances  example  creates instances of a
       stack set in two accounts and in four regions. The fault tolerance set-
       ting  ensures that the update is attempted in all accounts and regions,
       even if some stacks cannot be created.

          aws cloudformation create-stack-instances \
              --stack-set-name my-stack-set \
              --accounts 123456789012 223456789012 \
              --regions us-east-1 us-east-2 us-west-1 us-west-2 \
              --operation-preferences FailureToleranceCount=7

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "d7995c31-83c2-xmpl-a3d4-e9ca2811563f"
          }

       To create a stack set, use the create-stack-set command.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for this stack set operation.
