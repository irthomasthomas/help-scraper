DETECT-STACK-SET-DRIFT()                              DETECT-STACK-SET-DRIFT()



NAME
       detect-stack-set-drift -

DESCRIPTION
       Detect  drift on a stack set. When CloudFormation performs drift detec-
       tion on a stack set, it performs drift detection on the  stack  associ-
       ated  with  each stack instance in the stack set. For more information,
       see How CloudFormation performs drift detection on a stack set .
          DetectStackSetDrift returns the OperationId of the stack  set  drift
          detection operation. Use this operation id with ``  DescribeStackSe-
          tOperation `` to monitor the progress of the drift detection  opera-
          tion. The drift detection operation may take some time, depending on
          the number of stack instances included in the stack set, in addition
          to the number of resources included in each stack.

       Once  the  operation has completed, use the following actions to return
       drift information:

       o Use ``  DescribeStackSet `` to return detailed information about  the
         stack  set,  including  detailed information about the last completed
         drift operation performed on the stack set. (Information about  drift
         operations that are in progress isn't included.)

       o Use ``  ListStackInstances `` to return a list of stack instances be-
         longing to the stack set, including the drift status and  last  drift
         time checked of each instance.

       o Use ``  DescribeStackInstance `` to return detailed information about
         a specific stack instance, including its drift status and last  drift
         time checked.

       For  more information about performing a drift detection operation on a
       stack set, see Detecting unmanaged changes in stack sets .

       You can only run a single drift detection operation on  a  given  stack
       set at one time.

       To  stop a drift detection stack set operation, use ``  StopStackSetOp-
       eration `` .

SYNOPSIS
            detect-stack-set-drift
          --stack-set-name <value>
          [--operation-preferences <value>]
          [--operation-id <value>]
          [--call-as <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name of the stack set on which to perform  the  drift  detection
          operation.

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          The  user-specified  preferences  for  how CloudFormation performs a
          stack set operation.

          For more information about maximum concurrent accounts  and  failure
          tolerance, see Stack set operation options .

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The  concurrency  type  of deploying StackSets operations in Re-
              gions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The order of the Regions in where you want to perform the  stack
              operation.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in  that  Region.
              If  the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack op-
              eration can fail before CloudFormation stops  the  operation  in
              that  Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFor-
              mation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of accounts in which to perform  this  opera-
              tion  at one time. This is dependent on the value of FailureTol-
              eranceCount .``MaxConcurrentCount`` is at most one more than the
              FailureToleranceCount .

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The  maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this op-
              eration at one time.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero.  In  this  case, CloudFormation sets the number as one in-
              stead.

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          }

       --operation-id (string)
          The ID of the stack set operation.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detect drift on a stack set and all associated stack instances

       The  following detect-stack-set-drift example initiates drift detection
       operations on the specified stack set,  including  all  the  stack  in-
       stances  associated  with  that  stack set, and returns an operation ID
       that can be used to track the status of the drift operation.

          aws cloudformation detect-stack-set-drift \
              --stack-set-name stack-set-drift-example

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For more information, see Detecting Unmanaged Configuration Changes  in
       Stack Sets in the AWS CloudFormation Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The ID of the drift detection stack set operation.

          You  can use this operation ID with ``  DescribeStackSetOperation ``
          to monitor the progress of the drift detection operation.
