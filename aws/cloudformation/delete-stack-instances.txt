OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to delete stack
          instances for.

       --accounts (list)
          [Self-managed  permissions] The names of the Amazon Web Services ac-
          counts that you want to delete stack instances for.

          You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets , but not both.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deployment-targets (structure)
          [Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts from  which
          to delete stack instances.

          You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets , but not both.

          Accounts -> (list)
              The  names of one or more Amazon Web Services accounts for which
              you want to deploy stack set updates.

              (string)

          AccountsUrl -> (string)
              Returns the value of the AccountsUrl property.

          OrganizationalUnitIds -> (list)
              The organization root ID or  organizational  unit  (OU)  IDs  to
              which StackSets deploys.

              (string)

          AccountFilterType -> (string)
              Limit deployment targets to individual accounts or include addi-
              tional accounts with provided OUs.

              The following is a list of possible values for  the  AccountFil-
              terType operation.

              o INTERSECTION  : StackSets deploys to the accounts specified in
                Accounts parameter.

              o DIFFERENCE : StackSets excludes the accounts specified in  Ac-
                counts  parameter. This enables user to avoid certain accounts
                within an OU such as suspended accounts.

              o UNION : StackSets includes additional accounts deployment tar-
                gets.   This  is the default value if AccountFilterType is not
                provided. This enables user to update an entire OU  and  indi-
                vidual accounts from a different OU in one request, which used
                to be two separate requests.

              o NONE : Deploys to all the accounts in specified organizational
                units (OU).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Accounts=string,string,AccountsUrl=string,OrganizationalUnitIds=string,string,AccountFilterType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Accounts": ["string", ...],
            "AccountsUrl": "string",
            "OrganizationalUnitIds": ["string", ...],
            "AccountFilterType": "NONE"|"INTERSECTION"|"DIFFERENCE"|"UNION"
          }

       --regions (list)
          The  Amazon  Web Services Regions where you want to delete stack set
          instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          Preferences for how CloudFormation performs this  stack  set  opera-
          tion.

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The  concurrency  type  of deploying StackSets operations in Re-
              gions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The order of the Regions where you want to perform the stack op-
              eration.

              NOTE:
                 RegionOrder isn't followed if AutoDeployment is enabled.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in  that  Region.
              If  the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack op-
              eration can fail before CloudFormation stops  the  operation  in
              that  Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFor-
              mation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of accounts in which to perform  this  opera-
              tion  at one time. This can depend on the value of FailureToler-
              anceCount depending on your ConcurrencyMode . MaxConcurrentCount
              is at most one more than the FailureToleranceCount if you're us-
              ing STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE .

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this  op-
              eration at one time.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number  as  one  in-
              stead.

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          ConcurrencyMode -> (string)
              Specifies how the concurrency level behaves during the operation
              execution.

              o STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE : This option dynamically lowers  the
                concurrency  level  to  ensure  the  number of failed accounts
                never exceeds the value of FailureToleranceCount +1. The  ini-
                tial  actual  concurrency  is  set  to the lower of either the
                value of the MaxConcurrentCount , or the value of  FailureTol-
                eranceCount +1. The actual concurrency is then reduced propor-
                tionally by the number of failures. This is the default behav-
                ior.  If  failure tolerance or Maximum concurrent accounts are
                set to percentages, the behavior is similar.

              o SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE : This option  decouples  FailureToler-
                anceCount  from  the actual concurrency. This allows stack set
                operations to run at the concurrency level set by the  MaxCon-
                currentCount value, or MaxConcurrentPercentage , regardless of
                the number of failures.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionConcurrencyType=string,RegionOrder=string,string,FailureToleranceCount=integer,FailureTolerancePercentage=integer,MaxConcurrentCount=integer,MaxConcurrentPercentage=integer,ConcurrencyMode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RegionConcurrencyType": "SEQUENTIAL"|"PARALLEL",
            "RegionOrder": ["string", ...],
            "FailureToleranceCount": integer,
            "FailureTolerancePercentage": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentCount": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentPercentage": integer,
            "ConcurrencyMode": "STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE"|"SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE"
          }

       --retain-stacks | --no-retain-stacks (boolean)
          Removes the stack  instances  from  the  specified  stack  set,  but
          doesn't delete the stacks. You can't reassociate a retained stack or
          add an existing, saved stack to a new stack set.

          For more information, see Stack set operation options .

       --operation-id (string)
          The unique identifier for this stack set operation.

          If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automat-
          ically.

          The  operation  ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure
          that CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even
          if you retry the request multiple times. You can retry stack set op-
          eration requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received
          them.

          Repeating  this  stack set operation with a new operation ID retries
          all stack instances whose status is OUTDATED .

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete stack instances

       The  following  delete-stack-instances  example  deletes instances of a
       stack set in two accounts in two regions and terminates the stacks.

          aws cloudformation delete-stack-instances \
              --stack-set-name my-stack-set \
              --accounts 123456789012 567890123456 \
              --regions us-east-1 us-west-1 \
              --no-retain-stacks

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "ad49f10c-fd1d-413f-a20a-8de6e2fa8f27"
          }

       To delete an empty stack set, use the delete-stack-set command.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for this stack set operation.
