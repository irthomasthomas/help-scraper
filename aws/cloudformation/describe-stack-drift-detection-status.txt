NAME
       describe-stack-drift-detection-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  a stack drift detection operation. A stack
       drift detection operation detects whether a stack's  actual  configura-
       tion  differs, or has drifted , from its expected configuration, as de-
       fined in the stack template and any values specified as template param-
       eters.  A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its re-
       sources have drifted. For more information  about  stack  and  resource
       drift,  see  Detecting  Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and
       Resources .

       Use  DetectStackDrift to initiate a stack  drift  detection  operation.
       DetectStackDrift returns a StackDriftDetectionId you can use to monitor
       the progress of the operation using DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus .
       Once the drift detection operation has completed, use  DescribeStackRe-
       sourceDrifts to return drift information about the stack  and  its  re-
       sources.

OPTIONS
       --stack-drift-detection-id (string)
          The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

          CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID,
          each time this operation is run. However, the number  of  drift  re-
          sults  CloudFormation retains for any given stack, and for how long,
          may vary.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To check a drift detection operation's status

       The following  describe-stack-drift-detection-status  example  displays
       the  status  of  a drift detection operation. Get the by ID running the
       detect-stack-drift command.

          aws cloudformation describe-stack-drift-detection-status \
              --stack-drift-detection-id 1a229160-e4d9-xmpl-ab67-0a4f93df83d4

       Output:

          {
              "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/my-stack/d0a825a0-e4cd-xmpl-b9fb-061c69e99204",
              "StackDriftDetectionId": "1a229160-e4d9-xmpl-ab67-0a4f93df83d4",
              "StackDriftStatus": "DRIFTED",
              "DetectionStatus": "DETECTION_COMPLETE",
              "DriftedStackResourceCount": 1,
              "Timestamp": "2019-10-02T05:54:30.902Z"
          }

OUTPUT
       StackId -> (string)
          The ID of the stack.

       StackDriftDetectionId -> (string)
          The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

          CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID,
          each  time  this  operation  is  run. However, the number of reports
          CloudFormation retains for any given stack, and for  how  long,  may
          vary.

       StackDriftStatus -> (string)
          Status  of the stack's actual configuration compared to its expected
          configuration.

          o DRIFTED : The stack differs from its expected template  configura-
            tion.  A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its
            resources have drifted.

          o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation hasn't checked if the  stack  differs
            from its expected template configuration.

          o IN_SYNC  :  The  stack's actual configuration matches its expected
            template configuration.

          o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

       DetectionStatus -> (string)
          The status of the stack drift detection operation.

          o DETECTION_COMPLETE : The stack drift detection operation has  suc-
            cessfully  completed  for  all resources in the stack that support
            drift detection. (Resources that don't currently support stack de-
            tection  remain  unchecked.) If you specified logical resource IDs
            for CloudFormation to use as a filter for the stack  drift  detec-
            tion  operation,  only  the  resources  with those logical IDs are
            checked for drift.

          o DETECTION_FAILED : The stack drift detection operation has  failed
            for  at least one resource in the stack. Results will be available
            for resources on which CloudFormation successfully completed drift
            detection.

          o DETECTION_IN_PROGRESS  :  The  stack  drift detection operation is
            currently in progress.

       DetectionStatusReason -> (string)
          The reason the stack drift detection operation has its current  sta-
          tus.

       DriftedStackResourceCount -> (integer)
          Total  number of stack resources that have drifted. This is NULL un-
          til the drift detection operation reaches a status of DETECTION_COM-
          PLETE  .  This  value  will  be  0  for stacks whose drift status is
          IN_SYNC .

       Timestamp -> (timestamp)
          Time at which the stack drift detection operation was initiated.
