NAME
       describe-stack-drift-detection-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  a stack drift detection operation. A stack
       drift detection operation detects whether a stack's  actual  configura-
       tion differs, or has drifted , from it's expected configuration, as de-
       fined in the stack template and any values specified as template param-
       eters.  A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its re-
       sources have drifted. For more information  about  stack  and  resource
       drift,  see  Detecting  Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and
       Resources .

       Use  DetectStackDrift to initiate a stack  drift  detection  operation.
       DetectStackDrift returns a StackDriftDetectionId you can use to monitor
       the progress of the operation using DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus .
       Once the drift detection operation has completed, use  DescribeStackRe-
       sourceDrifts to return drift information about the stack  and  its  re-
       sources.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-drift-detection-status
          --stack-drift-detection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-drift-detection-id (string)
          The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

          CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID,
          each time this operation is run. However, the number  of  drift  re-
          sults  CloudFormation retains for any given stack, and for how long,
          may vary.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To check a drift detection operation's status

       The  following  describe-stack-drift-detection-status  example displays
       the status of a drift detection operation. Get the by  ID  running  the
       detect-stack-drift command.

          aws cloudformation describe-stack-drift-detection-status \
              --stack-drift-detection-id 1a229160-e4d9-xmpl-ab67-0a4f93df83d4

       Output:

          {
              "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/my-stack/d0a825a0-e4cd-xmpl-b9fb-061c69e99204",
              "StackDriftDetectionId": "1a229160-e4d9-xmpl-ab67-0a4f93df83d4",
              "StackDriftStatus": "DRIFTED",
              "DetectionStatus": "DETECTION_COMPLETE",
              "DriftedStackResourceCount": 1,
              "Timestamp": "2019-10-02T05:54:30.902Z"
          }

OUTPUT
       StackId -> (string)
          The ID of the stack.

       StackDriftDetectionId -> (string)
          The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

          CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID,
          each time this operation is run.  However,  the  number  of  reports
          CloudFormation  retains  for  any given stack, and for how long, may
          vary.

       StackDriftStatus -> (string)
          Status of the stack's actual configuration compared to its  expected
          configuration.

          o DRIFTED  : The stack differs from its expected template configura-
            tion. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of  its
            resources have drifted.

          o NOT_CHECKED  :  CloudFormation hasn't checked if the stack differs
            from its expected template configuration.

          o IN_SYNC : The stack's actual configuration  matches  its  expected
            template configuration.

          o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

       DetectionStatus -> (string)
          The status of the stack drift detection operation.

          o DETECTION_COMPLETE  : The stack drift detection operation has suc-
            cessfully completed for all resources in the  stack  that  support
            drift detection. (Resources that don't currently support stack de-
            tection remain unchecked.) If you specified logical  resource  IDs
            for  CloudFormation  to use as a filter for the stack drift detec-
            tion operation, only the resources  with  those  logical  IDs  are
            checked for drift.

          o DETECTION_FAILED  : The stack drift detection operation has failed
            for at least one resource in the stack. Results will be  available
            for resources on which CloudFormation successfully completed drift
            detection.

          o DETECTION_IN_PROGRESS : The stack  drift  detection  operation  is
            currently in progress.

       DetectionStatusReason -> (string)
          The  reason the stack drift detection operation has its current sta-
          tus.

       DriftedStackResourceCount -> (integer)
          Total number of stack resources that have drifted. This is NULL  un-
          til the drift detection operation reaches a status of DETECTION_COM-
          PLETE . This value will be  0  for  stacks  whose  drift  status  is
          IN_SYNC .

       Timestamp -> (timestamp)
          Time at which the stack drift detection operation was initiated.
