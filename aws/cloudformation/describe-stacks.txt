DESCRIBE-STACKS()                                            DESCRIBE-STACKS()



NAME
       describe-stacks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  description for the specified stack; if no stack name was
       specified, then it returns the description for all the stacks  created.
       For  more information about a stack's event history, see CloudFormation
       stack creation events in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NOTE:
          If the stack doesn't exist, a ValidationError is returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-stacks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Stacks

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)

          NOTE:
              If  you  don't pass a parameter to StackName , the API returns a
              response that describes all resources in the account, which  can
              impact  performance. This requires ListStacks and DescribeStacks
              permissions.

              Consider using the  ListStacks API if you're not passing  a  pa-
              rameter to StackName .

              The  IAM policy below can be added to IAM policies when you want
              to limit resource-level permissions and avoid  returning  a  re-
              sponse when no parameter is sent in the request:

              {  "Version":  "2012-10-17",  "Statement":  [{ "Effect": "Deny",
              "Action":    "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",     "NotResource":
              "arn:aws:cloudformation:::stack//" }] }

          The  name  or  the unique stack ID that's associated with the stack,
          which aren't always interchangeable:

          o Running stacks: You can specify either the  stack's  name  or  its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                     ParameterKey -> (string)
                        The key associated with the parameter.  If  you  don't
                        specify  a  key  and value for a particular parameter,
                        CloudFormation uses the default value that's specified
                        in your template.

                     ParameterValue -> (string)
                        The input value associated with the parameter.

                     UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                        During  a  stack  update,  use  the existing parameter
                        value that the stack is using for  a  given  parameter
                        key.  If you specify true , do not specify a parameter
                        value.

                     ResolvedValue -> (string)
                        Read-only. The value that corresponds to a SSM parame-
                        ter key. This field is returned only for SSM parameter
                        types in the template.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the stack was created.

              DeletionTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the stack was deleted.

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the stack was last updated. This field will only  be
                 returned if the stack has been updated at least once.

              RollbackConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  rollback  triggers  for CloudFormation to monitor during
                 stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified
                 monitoring period afterwards.

                 RollbackTriggers -> (list)
                     The  triggers  to monitor during stack creation or update
                     actions.

                     By default, CloudFormation saves  the  rollback  triggers
                     specified  for a stack and applies them to any subsequent
                     update operations for the stack, unless you specify  oth-
                     erwise.  If you do specify rollback triggers for this pa-
                     rameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers pre-
                     viously specified for the stack. This means:

                     o To  use  the rollback triggers previously specified for
                       this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter.

                     o To specify new or updated rollback triggers,  you  must
                       specify  all  the  triggers that you want used for this
                       stack, even triggers you've specified before (for exam-
                       ple, when creating the stack or during a previous stack
                       update). Any triggers that you don't include in the up-
                       dated  list  of  triggers  are no longer applied to the
                       stack.

                     o To remove all currently specified triggers, specify  an
                       empty list for this parameter.

                     If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack oper-
                     ation fails and is rolled back.

                     (structure)
                        A rollback trigger CloudFormation monitors during cre-
                        ation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you
                        specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation
                        or  within the specified monitoring period afterwards,
                        CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation.

                        Arn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  rollback
                            trigger.

                            If  a  specified  trigger  is  missing, the entire
                            stack operation fails and is rolled back.

                        Type -> (string)
                            The resource type of the rollback trigger. Specify
                            either          AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm          or
                            AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm resource types.

                 MonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in minutes, during which  CloudForma-
                     tion  should  monitor all the rollback triggers after the
                     stack creation or update operation deploys all  necessary
                     resources.

                     The default is 0 minutes.

                     If  you specify a monitoring period but don't specify any
                     rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the  speci-
                     fied  period of time before cleaning up old resources af-
                     ter update operations. You can use this monitoring period
                     to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manu-
                     ally  cancel  the  stack  creation   or   update   (using
                     CancelUpdateStack , for example) as necessary.

                     If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still
                     monitors the specified  rollback  triggers  during  stack
                     creation  and  update operations. Then, for update opera-
                     tions, it begins disposing of old  resources  immediately
                     once the operation completes.

              StackStatus -> (string)
                 Current status of the stack.

              StackStatusReason -> (string)
                 Success/failure message associated with the stack status.

              DisableRollback -> (boolean)
                 Boolean to enable or disable rollback on stack creation fail-
                 ures:

                 o true : disable rollback.

                 o false : enable rollback.

              NotificationARNs -> (list)
                 Amazon SNS topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to which  stack
                 related events are published.

                 (string)

              TimeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of  time within which stack creation should com-
                 plete.

              Capabilities -> (list)
                 The capabilities allowed in the stack.

                 (string)

              Outputs -> (list)
                 A list of output structures.

                 (structure)
                     The Output data type.

                     OutputKey -> (string)
                        The key associated with the output.

                     OutputValue -> (string)
                        The value associated with the output.

                     Description -> (string)
                        User defined description associated with the output.

                     ExportName -> (string)
                        The name of the export associated with the output.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Man-
                 agement (IAM) role that's associated with the stack. During a
                 stack operation, CloudFormation uses this role's  credentials
                 to make calls on your behalf.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of Tag s that specify information about the stack.

                 (structure)
                     The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that
                     can be used to store information about an  CloudFormation
                     stack.

                     Key -> (string)
                        Required . A string used to identify this tag. You can
                        specify a maximum of 128 characters  for  a  tag  key.
                        Tags  owned  by  Amazon  Web Services (Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices) have the reserved prefix: aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        Required . A string containing the value for this tag.
                        You  can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag
                        value.

              EnableTerminationProtection -> (boolean)
                 Whether termination protection is enabled for the stack.

                 For nested stacks , termination protection is set on the root
                 stack  and can't be changed directly on the nested stack. For
                 more information, see Protecting a Stack From  Being  Deleted
                 in the CloudFormation User Guide .

              ParentId -> (string)
                 For  nested  stacks--stacks  created as resources for another
                 stack--the stack ID of the direct parent of this  stack.  For
                 the  first level of nested stacks, the root stack is also the
                 parent stack.

                 For more information, see Working with Nested Stacks  in  the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              RootId -> (string)
                 For  nested  stacks--stacks  created as resources for another
                 stack--the stack ID of  the  top-level  stack  to  which  the
                 nested stack ultimately belongs.

                 For  more  information, see Working with Nested Stacks in the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              DriftInformation -> (structure)
                 Information about whether a stack's actual configuration dif-
                 fers,  or  has  drifted , from its expected configuration, as
                 defined in the stack template and  any  values  specified  as
                 template  parameters. For more information, see Detecting Un-
                 regulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

                 StackDriftStatus -> (string)
                     Status of the stack's actual  configuration  compared  to
                     its expected template configuration.

                     o DRIFTED  : The stack differs from its expected template
                       configuration. A stack is considered to have drifted if
                       one or more of its resources have drifted.

                     o NOT_CHECKED  :  CloudFormation  hasn't  checked  if the
                       stack differs from its expected template configuration.

                     o IN_SYNC : The stack's actual configuration matches  its
                       expected template configuration.

                     o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

                 LastCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     Most  recent  time  when  a drift detection operation was
                     initiated on the stack, or  any  of  its  individual  re-
                     sources that support drift detection.

              RetainExceptOnCreate -> (boolean)
                 When  set  to true , newly created resources are deleted when
                 the operation rolls back. This  includes  newly  created  re-
                 sources marked with a deletion policy of Retain .

                 Default: false

              DetailedStatus -> (string)
                 The  detailed  status of the resource or stack. If CONFIGURA-
                 TION_COMPLETE is present, the resource or resource configura-
                 tion  phase  has  completed  and the stabilization of the re-
                 sources is in progress. The stack sets CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE
                 when  all  of  the  resources  in the stack have reached that
                 event. For more information, see CloudFormation stack deploy-
                 ment in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  output  exceeds  1 MB in size, a string that identifies the
          next page of stacks. If no additional page  exists,  this  value  is
          null.
