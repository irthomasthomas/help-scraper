LIST-STACK-SET-OPERATIONS()                        LIST-STACK-SET-OPERATIONS()



NAME
       list-stack-set-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns summary information about operations performed on a stack set.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-stack-set-operations  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Summaries

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to  get  opera-
          tion summaries for.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list stack set operations

       The  following  list-stack-set-operations  example displays the list of
       the most recent operations on the specified stack set.

              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A list of StackSetOperationSummary structures that  contain  summary
          information about operations for the specified stack set.

          (structure)
              The structures that contain summary information about the speci-
              fied operation.

              OperationId -> (string)
                 The unique ID of the stack set operation.

              Action -> (string)
                 The type of operation: CREATE , UPDATE , or DELETE  .  Create
                 and  delete  operations  affect  only the specified stack in-
                 stances that are associated with the specified stack set. Up-
                 date  operations affect both the stack set itself and all as-
                 sociated stack set instances.

              Status -> (string)
                 The overall status of the operation.

                 o FAILED : The operation exceeded the specified failure  tol-
                   erance.  The failure tolerance value that you've set for an
                   operation is applied for each Region  during  stack  create
                   and  update  operations.  If  the  number  of failed stacks
                   within a Region exceeds the failure tolerance,  the  status
                   of  the  operation in the Region is set to FAILED . This in
                   turn sets the status of the operation as a whole to  FAILED
                   , and CloudFormation cancels the operation in any remaining
                   Regions.

                 o QUEUED : [Service-managed permissions]  For  automatic  de-
                   ployments that require a sequence of operations, the opera-
                   tion is queued to be performed. For more  information,  see
                   the  stack set operation status codes in the CloudFormation
                   User Guide.

                 o RUNNING : The operation is currently being performed.

                 o STOPPED : The user has canceled the operation.

                 o STOPPING : The operation is in the process of stopping,  at
                   user request.

                 o SUCCEEDED  :  The  operation completed creating or updating
                   all the specified stacks without exceeding the failure tol-
                   erance for the operation.

              CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time at which the operation was initiated. Note that the
                 creation times for the stack set operation might differ  from
                 the  creation  time of the individual stacks themselves. This
                 is because CloudFormation needs to perform  preparatory  work
                 for  the  operation,  such as dispatching the work to the re-
                 quested Regions, before actually creating the first stacks.

              EndTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the stack set operation ended,  across  all
                 accounts and Regions specified. Note that this doesn't neces-
                 sarily mean that the stack set operation was  successful,  or
                 even attempted, in each account or Region.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 The status of the operation in details.

              StatusDetails -> (structure)
                 Detailed information about the stack set operation.

                 FailedStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                     The  number of stack instances for which the StackSet op-
                     eration failed.

              OperationPreferences -> (structure)
                 The user-specified preferences for  how  CloudFormation  per-
                 forms a stack set operation.

                 For  more  information  about maximum concurrent accounts and
                 failure tolerance, see Stack set operation options .

                 RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
                     The concurrency type of deploying StackSets operations in
                     Regions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

                 RegionOrder -> (list)
                     The order of the Regions in where you want to perform the
                     stack operation.

                     (string)

                 FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of accounts, per Region, for which this opera-
                     tion  can  fail before CloudFormation stops the operation
                     in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a  Region,
                     CloudFormation  doesn't attempt the operation in any sub-
                     sequent Regions.

                     Conditional: You must  specify  either  FailureTolerance-
                     Count or FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

                     By default, 0 is specified.

                 FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
                     The  percentage  of  accounts, per Region, for which this
                     stack operation can fail before CloudFormation stops  the
                     operation  in that Region. If the operation is stopped in
                     a Region, CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in
                     any subsequent Regions.

                     When  calculating  the  number  of  accounts based on the
                     specified percentage, CloudFormation rounds down  to  the
                     next whole number.

                     Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureTolerance-
                     Count or FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

                     By default, 0 is specified.

                 MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of accounts in which to  perform  this
                     operation  at one time. This is dependent on the value of
                     FailureToleranceCount .``MaxConcurrentCount`` is at  most
                     one more than the FailureToleranceCount .

                     Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for
                     operations. For large deployments, under certain  circum-
                     stances  the actual number of accounts acted upon concur-
                     rently may be lower due to service throttling.

                     Conditional: You must specify  either  MaxConcurrentCount
                     or MaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

                     By default, 1 is specified.

                 MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  percentage  of accounts in which to perform
                     this operation at one time.

                     When calculating the number  of  accounts  based  on  the
                     specified  percentage,  CloudFormation rounds down to the
                     next whole number. This is true  except  in  cases  where
                     rounding  down would result is zero. In this case, Cloud-
                     Formation sets the number as one instead.

                     Note that this setting lets you specify the  maximum  for
                     operations.  For large deployments, under certain circum-
                     stances the actual number of accounts acted upon  concur-
                     rently may be lower due to service throttling.

                     Conditional:  You  must specify either MaxConcurrentCount
                     or MaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

                     By default, 1 is specified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all results, NextToken is set to a to-
          ken.  To retrieve the next set of results, call ListOperationResults
          again and assign that token to the request object's NextToken param-
          eter. If there are no remaining results, NextToken is set to null .
