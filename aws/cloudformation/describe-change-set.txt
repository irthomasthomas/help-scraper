DESCRIBE-CHANGE-SET()                                    DESCRIBE-CHANGE-SET()



NAME
       describe-change-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the inputs for the change set and a list of changes that Cloud-
       Formation will make if you execute the change set.  For  more  informa-
       tion,  see Updating Stacks Using Change Sets in the CloudFormation User
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-change-set is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Changes

OPTIONS
       --change-set-name (string)
          The  name  or  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the change set that you
          want to describe.

       --stack-name (string)
          If you specified the name of a change set, specify the stack name or
          ID (ARN) of the change set you want to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a change set

       The  following  describe-change-set example displays the details of the
       change set specified by change set name and stack name.

          aws cloudformation describe-change-set \
              --change-set-name my-change-set \
              --stack-name my-stack

       The following describe-change-set example displays the details  of  the
       change set specified by the full ARN of the change set:

          aws cloudformation describe-change-set \
              --change-set-name arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:changeSet/my-change-set/bc9555ba-a949-xmpl-bfb8-f41d04ec5784

OUTPUT
       ChangeSetName -> (string)
          The name of the change set.

       ChangeSetId -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the change set.

       StackId -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the stack that's associated with
          the change set.

       StackName -> (string)
          The name of the stack that's associated with the change set.

       Description -> (string)
          Information about the change set.

       Parameters -> (list)
          A list of Parameter structures that describes the  input  parameters
          and  their  values  used to create the change set. For more informa-
          tion, see the Parameter data type.

          (structure)
              The Parameter data type.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a
                 key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses
                 the default value that's specified in your template.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The input value associated with the parameter.

              UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                 During a stack update, use the existing parameter value  that
                 the  stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify
                 true , do not specify a parameter value.

              ResolvedValue -> (string)
                 Read-only. The value that corresponds to a SSM parameter key.
                 This  field  is  returned only for SSM parameter types in the
                 template.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The start time when the change set was created, in UTC.

       ExecutionStatus -> (string)
          If the change set execution status is AVAILABLE ,  you  can  execute
          the  change set. If you can't execute the change set, the status in-
          dicates why. For example, a change set might be  in  an  UNAVAILABLE
          state  because CloudFormation is still creating it or in an OBSOLETE
          state because the stack was already updated.

       Status -> (string)
          The current status of the change set, such as  CREATE_IN_PROGRESS  ,
          CREATE_COMPLETE , or FAILED .

       StatusReason -> (string)
          A  description  of the change set's status. For example, if your at-
          tempt to create a change set failed, CloudFormation shows the  error
          message.

       NotificationARNs -> (list)
          The ARNs of the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) top-
          ics that will be associated with the stack if you execute the change
          set.

          (string)

       RollbackConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  rollback  triggers  for  CloudFormation to monitor during stack
          creation and updating operations, and for the  specified  monitoring
          period afterwards.

          RollbackTriggers -> (list)
              The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.

              By default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified
              for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations
              for  the  stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify
              rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any
              list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

              o To  use  the  rollback  triggers previously specified for this
                stack, if any, don't specify this parameter.

              o To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must  specify
                all the triggers that you want used for this stack, even trig-
                gers you've specified before (for example, when  creating  the
                stack  or  during  a previous stack update). Any triggers that
                you don't include in the  updated  list  of  triggers  are  no
                longer applied to the stack.

              o To  remove  all currently specified triggers, specify an empty
                list for this parameter.

              If a specified trigger is missing, the  entire  stack  operation
              fails and is rolled back.

              (structure)
                 A  rollback  trigger  CloudFormation monitors during creation
                 and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes
                 to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the spec-
                 ified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back
                 the entire stack operation.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

                     If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack oper-
                     ation fails and is rolled back.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The resource type of the rollback trigger. Specify either
                     AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm or AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm
                     resource types.

          MonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)
              The amount of time,  in  minutes,  during  which  CloudFormation
              should  monitor  all  the rollback triggers after the stack cre-
              ation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

              The default is 0 minutes.

              If you specify a monitoring period but don't specify  any  roll-
              back  triggers,  CloudFormation still waits the specified period
              of time before cleaning up old  resources  after  update  opera-
              tions.  You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual
              stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation
              or update (using CancelUpdateStack , for example) as necessary.

              If  you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still moni-
              tors the specified rollback triggers during stack  creation  and
              update  operations.  Then, for update operations, it begins dis-
              posing of old resources  immediately  once  the  operation  com-
              pletes.

       Capabilities -> (list)
          If  you  execute  the change set, the list of capabilities that were
          explicitly acknowledged when the change set was created.

          (string)

       Tags -> (list)
          If you execute the change set, the tags that will be associated with
          the stack.

          (structure)
              The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be
              used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.

              Key -> (string)
                 Required . A string used to identify this tag. You can  spec-
                 ify  a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by
                 Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) have  the  reserved
                 prefix: aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 Required  .  A  string containing the value for this tag. You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

       Changes -> (list)
          A list of Change structures that describes the resources CloudForma-
          tion changes if you execute the change set.

          (structure)
              The  Change  structure describes the changes CloudFormation will
              perform if you execute the change set.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of entity that  CloudFormation  changes.  Currently,
                 the only entity type is Resource .

              HookInvocationCount -> (integer)
                 Is either null , if no hooks invoke for the resource, or con-
                 tains the number of hooks that will invoke for the resource.

              ResourceChange -> (structure)
                 A ResourceChange structure that describes  the  resource  and
                 action that CloudFormation will perform.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The  action  that  CloudFormation  takes on the resource,
                     such as Add (adds a new resource), Modify (changes a  re-
                     source),  Remove  (deletes a resource), Import (imports a
                     resource), or Dynamic  (exact  action  for  the  resource
                     can't be determined).

                 LogicalResourceId -> (string)
                     The  resource's  logical  ID,  which  is  defined  in the
                     stack's template.

                 PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
                     The resource's physical  ID  (resource  name).  Resources
                     that  you are adding don't have physical IDs because they
                     haven't been created.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     The   type   of   CloudFormation   resource,   such    as
                     AWS::S3::Bucket .

                 Replacement -> (string)
                     For  the  Modify action, indicates whether CloudFormation
                     will replace the resource  by  creating  a  new  one  and
                     deleting  the old one. This value depends on the value of
                     the RequiresRecreation property in the ResourceTargetDef-
                     inition structure. For example, if the RequiresRecreation
                     field is Always and the Evaluation field is Static ,  Re-
                     placement  is  True  . If the RequiresRecreation field is
                     Always and the Evaluation field is Dynamic ,  Replacement
                     is Conditionally .

                     If  you  have  multiple  changes with different Requires-
                     Recreation values, the Replacement value depends  on  the
                     change  with  the most impact. A RequiresRecreation value
                     of Always has the most impact, followed by  Conditionally
                     , and then Never .

                 Scope -> (list)
                     For the Modify action, indicates which resource attribute
                     is triggering this update, such as a change  in  the  re-
                     source attribute's Metadata , Properties , or Tags .

                     (string)

                 Details -> (list)
                     For  the  Modify  action,  a list of ResourceChangeDetail
                     structures that describes the changes that CloudFormation
                     will make to the resource.

                     (structure)
                        For  a  resource  with  Modify  as the action, the Re-
                        sourceChange structure describes the changes CloudFor-
                        mation will make to that resource.

                        Target -> (structure)
                            A   ResourceTargetDefinition  structure  that  de-
                            scribes the field that CloudFormation will  change
                            and whether the resource will be recreated.

                            Attribute -> (string)
                               Indicates  which resource attribute is trigger-
                               ing this update, such as a change  in  the  re-
                               source  attribute's  Metadata , Properties , or
                               Tags .

                            Name -> (string)
                               If the Attribute value is Properties , the name
                               of  the property. For all other attributes, the
                               value is null.

                            RequiresRecreation -> (string)
                               If the Attribute value is  Properties  ,  indi-
                               cates  whether a change to this property causes
                               the resource to be recreated. The value can  be
                               Never  ,  Always , or Conditionally . To deter-
                               mine the conditions for a Conditionally  recre-
                               ation,   see   the  update  behavior  for  that
                               property in the CloudFormation User Guide .

                        Evaluation -> (string)
                            Indicates whether CloudFormation can determine the
                            target  value,  and  whether the target value will
                            change before you execute a change set.

                            For Static evaluations, CloudFormation can  deter-
                            mine  that  the  target value will change, and its
                            value. For example, if you directly modify the In-
                            stanceType  property of an EC2 instance, CloudFor-
                            mation knows that this property value will change,
                            and its value, so this is a Static evaluation.

                            For  Dynamic evaluations, can't determine the tar-
                            get value because it depends on the result  of  an
                            intrinsic  function,  such  as a Ref or Fn::GetAtt
                            intrinsic function, when the stack is updated. For
                            example,  if your template includes a reference to
                            a resource  that's  conditionally  recreated,  the
                            value of the reference (the physical ID of the re-
                            source) might change, depending on if the resource
                            is  recreated.  If  the  resource is recreated, it
                            will have a new physical ID, so all references  to
                            that resource will also be updated.

                        ChangeSource -> (string)
                            The  group  to  which  the CausingEntity value be-
                            longs. There are five entity groups:

                            o ResourceReference  entities  are  Ref  intrinsic
                              functions  that  refer  to resources in the tem-
                              plate, such as { "Ref" : "MyEC2InstanceResource"
                              } .

                            o ParameterReference  entities  are  Ref intrinsic
                              functions that get  template  parameter  values,
                              such as { "Ref" : "MyPasswordParameter" } .

                            o ResourceAttribute  entities  are  Fn::GetAtt in-
                              trinsic functions that  get  resource  attribute
                              values,  such  as  {  "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "MyEC2In-
                              stanceResource", "PublicDnsName" ] } .

                            o DirectModification entities are changes that are
                              made directly to the template.

                            o Automatic    entities    are    AWS::CloudForma-
                              tion::Stack resource types, which are also known
                              as  nested stacks. If you made no changes to the
                              AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource, CloudForma-
                              tion  sets the ChangeSource to Automatic because
                              the nested stack's template might have  changed.
                              Changes to a nested stack's template aren't vis-
                              ible to CloudFormation until you run  an  update
                              on the parent stack.

                        CausingEntity -> (string)
                            The  identity  of  the  entity that triggered this
                            change. This entity  is  a  member  of  the  group
                            that's  specified  by  the ChangeSource field. For
                            example, if you modified the value of the KeyPair-
                            Name  parameter,  the CausingEntity is the name of
                            the parameter (KeyPairName ).

                            If the ChangeSource value is DirectModification  ,
                            no value is given for CausingEntity .

                 ChangeSetId -> (string)
                     The change set ID of the nested change set.

                 ModuleInfo -> (structure)
                     Contains  information about the module from which the re-
                     source was created, if the resource was  created  from  a
                     module included in the stack template.

                     TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                        A  concatenated  list of the module type or types con-
                        taining the resource. Module types are listed starting
                        with  the inner-most nested module, and separated by /
                        .

                        In the following example,  the  resource  was  created
                        from  a  module  of type AWS::First::Example::MODULE ,
                        that's nested inside a parent module of type AWS::Sec-
                        ond::Example::MODULE .
                            AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Exam-
                            ple::MODULE

                     LogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)
                        A concatenated list of the logical IDs of  the  module
                        or modules containing the resource. Modules are listed
                        starting with the inner-most nested module, and  sepa-
                        rated by / .

                        In  the  following  example,  the resource was created
                        from a module, moduleA , that's nested inside a parent
                        module, moduleB .
                            moduleA/moduleB

                        For  more  information, see Referencing resources in a
                        module in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the output exceeds 1 MB, a string that identifies the  next  page
          of changes. If there is no additional page, this value is null.

       IncludeNestedStacks -> (boolean)
          Verifies if IncludeNestedStacks is set to True .

       ParentChangeSetId -> (string)
          Specifies  the change set ID of the parent change set in the current
          nested change set hierarchy.

       RootChangeSetId -> (string)
          Specifies the change set ID of the root change set  in  the  current
          nested change set hierarchy.

       OnStackFailure -> (string)
          Determines  what  action will be taken if stack creation fails. When
          this parameter is specified, the DisableRollback  parameter  to  the
          ExecuteChangeSet  API  operation must not be specified. This must be
          one of these values:

          o DELETE - Deletes the change set if the stack creation fails.  This
            is  only valid when the ChangeSetType parameter is set to CREATE .
            If the deletion of the stack fails, the status  of  the  stack  is
            DELETE_FAILED .

          o DO_NOTHING  -  if  the  stack  creation fails, do nothing. This is
            equivalent to specifying true for the DisableRollback parameter to
            the ExecuteChangeSet API operation.

          o ROLLBACK  - if the stack creation fails, roll back the stack. This
            is equivalent to specifying false for the DisableRollback  parame-
            ter to the ExecuteChangeSet API operation.

       ImportExistingResources -> (boolean)
          Indicates if the change set imports resources that already exist.

          NOTE:
              This  parameter can only import resources that have custom names
              in templates. To import resources  that  do  not  accept  custom
              names,  such  as  EC2 instances, use the resource import feature
              instead.
