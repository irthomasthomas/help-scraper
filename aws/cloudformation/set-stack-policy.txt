NAME
       set-stack-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets a stack policy for a specified stack.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            set-stack-policy
          --stack-name <value>
          [--stack-policy-body <value>]
          [--stack-policy-url <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name  or  unique  stack  ID that you want to associate a policy
          with.

       --stack-policy-body (string)
          Structure containing the stack policy body. For more information, go
          to  Prevent  updates  to  stack resources in the CloudFormation User
          Guide. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the  StackPoli-
          cyURL parameter, but not both.

       --stack-policy-url (string)
          Location  of  a file containing the stack policy. The URL must point
          to a policy (maximum size: 16 KB) located in an Amazon S3 bucket  in
          the  same  Amazon  Web Services Region as the stack. You can specify
          either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but  not
          both.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To apply a stack policy

       The  following set-stack-policy example disables updates for the speci-
       fied resource in the specified stack. stack-policy.json is a JSON docu-
       ment that defines the operations allowed on resources in the stack.

          aws cloudformation set-stack-policy \
              --stack-name my-stack \
              --stack-policy-body file://stack-policy.json

       Output:

          {
            "Statement" : [
              {
                "Effect" : "Allow",
                "Action" : "Update:*",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Resource" : "*"
              },
              {
                "Effect" : "Deny",
                "Action" : "Update:*",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Resource" : "LogicalResourceId/bucket"
              }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       None



                                                            SET-STACK-POLICY()
