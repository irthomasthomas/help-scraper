OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or the unique stack ID of the stack set for the stack oper-
          ation.

       --operation-id (string)
          The unique ID of the stack set operation.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a stack set operation

       The  following  describe-stack-set-operation`  example displays details
       for an update operation on the specified stack set.

          }

OUTPUT
       StackSetOperation -> (structure)
          The specified stack set operation.

          OperationId -> (string)
              The unique ID of a stack set operation.

          StackSetId -> (string)
              The ID of the stack set.

          Action -> (string)
              The type of stack set operation: CREATE , UPDATE , or  DELETE  .
              Create and delete operations affect only the specified stack set
              instances that are associated with the specified stack set.  Up-
              date operations affect both the stack set itself, in addition to
              all associated stack set instances.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the operation.

              o FAILED : The operation exceeded the specified  failure  toler-
                ance. The failure tolerance value that you've set for an oper-
                ation is applied for each Region during stack create  and  up-
                date  operations.  If the number of failed stacks within a Re-
                gion exceeds the failure tolerance, the status of  the  opera-
                tion  in  the  Region is set to FAILED . This in turn sets the
                status of the operation as a whole to FAILED , and CloudForma-
                tion cancels the operation in any remaining Regions.

              o QUEUED  :  [Service-managed permissions] For automatic deploy-
                ments that require a sequence of operations, the operation  is
                queued  to  be  performed. For more information, see the stack
                set operation status codes in the CloudFormation User Guide.

              o RUNNING : The operation is currently being performed.

              o STOPPED : The user has canceled the operation.

              o STOPPING : The operation is in the  process  of  stopping,  at
                user request.

              o SUCCEEDED  :  The operation completed creating or updating all
                the specified stacks without exceeding the  failure  tolerance
                for the operation.

          OperationPreferences -> (structure)
              The  preferences  for how CloudFormation performs this stack set
              operation.

              RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
                 The concurrency type of deploying StackSets operations in Re-
                 gions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

              RegionOrder -> (list)
                 The  order of the Regions where you want to perform the stack
                 operation.

                 (string)

              FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
                 The number of accounts, per Region, for which this  operation
                 can  fail  before  CloudFormation stops the operation in that
                 Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region,  CloudForma-
                 tion doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

                 Conditional: You must specify either FailureToleranceCount or
                 FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

                 By default, 0 is specified.

              FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
                 The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this  stack
                 operation  can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation
                 in that Region. If the operation  is  stopped  in  a  Region,
                 CloudFormation  doesn't  attempt  the operation in any subse-
                 quent Regions.

                 When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  speci-
                 fied percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole
                 number.

                 Conditional: You must specify either FailureToleranceCount or
                 FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

                 By default, 0 is specified.

              MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this oper-
                 ation at one time. This is dependent on the value of Failure-
                 ToleranceCount  .``MaxConcurrentCount``  is  at most one more
                 than the FailureToleranceCount .

                 Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum for oper-
                 ations.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances
                 the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be
                 lower due to service throttling.

                 Conditional:  You  must  specify either MaxConcurrentCount or
                 MaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

                 By default, 1 is specified.

              MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
                 The maximum percentage of accounts in which to  perform  this
                 operation at one time.

                 When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the speci-
                 fied percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole
                 number.  This  is  true  except  in cases where rounding down
                 would result is zero. In this case, CloudFormation  sets  the
                 number as one instead.

                 Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum for oper-
                 ations. For large deployments,  under  certain  circumstances
                 the  actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be
                 lower due to service throttling.

                 Conditional: You must specify  either  MaxConcurrentCount  or
                 MaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

                 By default, 1 is specified.

          RetainStacks -> (boolean)
              For  stack  set  operations  of  action  type DELETE , specifies
              whether to remove the stack instances from the  specified  stack
              set, but doesn't delete the stacks. You can't re-associate a re-
              tained stack, or add an existing, saved stack  to  a  new  stack
              set.

          AdministrationRoleARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used to perform
              this stack set operation.

              Use customized administrator roles to  control  which  users  or
              groups  can  manage specific stack sets within the same adminis-
              trator account. For more information, see Define Permissions for
              Multiple Administrators in the CloudFormation User Guide .

          ExecutionRoleName -> (string)
              The  name of the IAM execution role used to create or update the
              stack set.

              Use customized execution roles to control which stack  resources
              users and groups can include in their stack sets.

          CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  time  at  which  the operation was initiated. Note that the
              creation times for the stack set operation might differ from the
              creation  time  of the individual stacks themselves. This is be-
              cause CloudFormation needs to perform preparatory work  for  the
              operation,  such  as  dispatching  the work to the requested Re-
              gions, before actually creating the first stacks.

          EndTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the stack set operation ended, across all  ac-
              counts and Regions specified. Note that this doesn't necessarily
              mean that the stack set operation was successful,  or  even  at-
              tempted, in each account or Region.

          DeploymentTargets -> (structure)
              [Service-managed  permissions]  The  Organizations  accounts af-
              fected by the stack operation.

              Accounts -> (list)
                 The names of one or more Amazon  Web  Services  accounts  for
                 which you want to deploy stack set updates.

                 (string)

              AccountsUrl -> (string)
                 Returns the value of the AccountsUrl property.

              OrganizationalUnitIds -> (list)
                 The  organization  root ID or organizational unit (OU) IDs to
                 which StackSets deploys.

                 (string)

              AccountFilterType -> (string)
                 Limit deployment targets to individual  accounts  or  include
                 additional accounts with provided OUs.

                 The  following  is a list of possible values for the Account-
                 FilterType operation.

                 o INTERSECTION : StackSets deploys to the accounts  specified
                   in Accounts parameter.

                 o DIFFERENCE  :  StackSets excludes the accounts specified in
                   Accounts parameter. This enables user to avoid certain  ac-
                   counts within an OU such as suspended accounts.

                 o UNION  :  StackSets includes additional accounts deployment
                   targets.  This is the default value if AccountFilterType is
                   not  provided. This enables user to update an entire OU and
                   individual accounts from a different  OU  in  one  request,
                   which used to be two separate requests.

                 o NONE  :  Deploys to all the accounts in specified organiza-
                   tional units (OU).

          StackSetDriftDetectionDetails -> (structure)
              Detailed information about the drift status of  the  stack  set.
              This includes information about drift operations currently being
              performed on the stack set.

              This information will only be present for stack  set  operations
              whose Action type is DETECT_DRIFT .

              For  more  information, see Detecting Unmanaged Changes in Stack
              Sets in the CloudFormation User Guide.

              DriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status of the stack set's actual  configuration  compared  to
                 its  expected  template  and parameter configuration. A stack
                 set is considered to have drifted if one or more of its stack
                 instances  have  drifted from their expected template and pa-
                 rameter configuration.

                 o DRIFTED : One or more of the stack instances  belonging  to
                   the  stack set stack differs from the expected template and
                   parameter configuration. A stack instance is considered  to
                   have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associ-
                   ated stack have drifted.

                 o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation hasn't checked the  stack  set
                   for drift.

                 o IN_SYNC : All of the stack instances belonging to the stack
                   set stack match from the expected  template  and  parameter
                   configuration.

              DriftDetectionStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the stack set drift detection operation.

                 o COMPLETED : The drift detection operation completed without
                   failing on any stack instances.

                 o FAILED : The drift detection operation exceeded the  speci-
                   fied failure tolerance.

                 o PARTIAL_SUCCESS  :  The drift detection operation completed
                   without exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation.

                 o IN_PROGRESS : The drift detection  operation  is  currently
                   being performed.

                 o STOPPED  : The user has canceled the drift detection opera-
                   tion.

              LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detec-
                 tion  operation on the stack set. This value will be NULL for
                 any stack set on which drift detection hasn't yet  been  per-
                 formed.

              TotalStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  total  number of stack instances belonging to this stack
                 set.

                 The total number of stack instances is equal to the total of:

                 o Stack instances that match the stack set configuration.

                 o Stack instances that have drifted from the stack  set  con-

                 o Stack  instances  where  the  drift detection operation has
                   failed.

                 o Stack instances currently being checked for drift.

              DriftedStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The number of stack instances that have drifted from the  ex-
                 pected template and parameter configuration of the stack set.
                 A stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or more
                 of  the  resources  in the associated stack don't match their
                 expected configuration.

              InSyncStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The number of stack instances which match the  expected  tem-
                 plate and parameter configuration of the stack set.

              InProgressStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  stack  instances  that  are  currently being
                 checked for drift.

              FailedStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The number of stack instances for which the  drift  detection
                 operation failed.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              The status of the operation in details.

          StatusDetails -> (structure)
              Detailed information about the StackSet operation.

              FailedStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of stack instances for which the StackSet opera-
                 tion failed.
