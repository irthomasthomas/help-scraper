DESCRIPTION
       Import  existing stacks into a new stack sets. Use the stack import op-
       eration to import up to 10 stacks into a new stack set in the same  ac-
       count  as  the source stack or in a different administrator account and
       Region, by specifying the stack ID of the stack you intend to import.

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name of the stack set. The name must be  unique  in  the  Region
          where you create your stack set.

       --stack-ids (list)
          The IDs of the stacks you are importing into a stack set. You import
          up to 10 stacks per stack set at a time.

          Specify either StackIds or StackIdsUrl .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --stack-ids-url (string)
          The Amazon S3 URL which contains list of stack ids to be inputted.

          Specify either StackIds or StackIdsUrl .

       --organizational-unit-ids (list)
          The list of OU ID's to which the stacks being  imported  has  to  be
          mapped as deployment target.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          The  user-specified  preferences  for  how CloudFormation performs a
          stack set operation.

          For more information about maximum concurrent accounts  and  failure
          tolerance, see Stack set operation options .

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The  concurrency  type  of deploying StackSets operations in Re-
              gions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The order of the Regions where you want to perform the stack op-
              eration.

              NOTE:
                 RegionOrder isn't followed if AutoDeployment is enabled.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in  that  Region.
              If  the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack op-
              eration can fail before CloudFormation stops  the  operation  in
              that  Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFor-
              mation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of accounts in which to perform  this  opera-
              tion  at one time. This can depend on the value of FailureToler-
              anceCount depending on your ConcurrencyMode . MaxConcurrentCount
              is at most one more than the FailureToleranceCount if you're us-
              ing STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE .

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this  op-
              eration at one time.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number  as  one  in-
              stead.

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          ConcurrencyMode -> (string)
              Specifies how the concurrency level behaves during the operation
              execution.

              o STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE : This option dynamically lowers  the
                concurrency  level  to  ensure  the  number of failed accounts
                never exceeds the value of FailureToleranceCount +1. The  ini-
                tial  actual  concurrency  is  set  to the lower of either the
                value of the MaxConcurrentCount , or the value  of  MaxConcur-
                rentCount  +1.  The actual concurrency is then reduced propor-
                tionally by the number of failures. This is the default behav-
                ior.  If  failure tolerance or Maximum concurrent accounts are
                set to percentages, the behavior is similar.

              o SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE : This option  decouples  FailureToler-
                anceCount  from  the actual concurrency. This allows stack set
                operations to run at the concurrency level set by the  MaxCon-
                currentCount value, or MaxConcurrentPercentage , regardless of
                the number of failures.

       --operation-id (string)
          A unique, user defined, identifier for the stack set operation.

       --call-as (string)
          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o For service managed stack sets, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
