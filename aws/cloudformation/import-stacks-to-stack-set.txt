IMPORT-STACKS-TO-STACK-SET()                      IMPORT-STACKS-TO-STACK-SET()



NAME
       import-stacks-to-stack-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Import  existing stacks into a new stack sets. Use the stack import op-
       eration to import up to 10 stacks into a new stack set in the same  ac-
       count  as  the source stack or in a different administrator account and
       Region, by specifying the stack ID of the stack you intend to import.

       NOTE:
          ImportStacksToStackSet is only  supported  by  self-managed  permis-
          sions.

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  stack set. The name must be unique in the Region
          where you create your stack set.

       --stack-ids (list)
          The IDs of the stacks you are importing into a stack set. You import
          up to 10 stacks per stack set at a time.

          Specify either StackIds or StackIdsUrl .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --stack-ids-url (string)
          The Amazon S3 URL which contains list of stack ids to be inputted.

          Specify either StackIds or StackIdsUrl .

       --organizational-unit-ids (list)
          The  list  of  OU  ID's to which the stacks being imported has to be
          mapped as deployment target.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          The user-specified preferences for  how  CloudFormation  performs  a
          stack set operation.

          For  more  information about maximum concurrent accounts and failure
          tolerance, see Stack set operation options .

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The concurrency type of deploying StackSets  operations  in  Re-
              gions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The  order of the Regions in where you want to perform the stack
              operation.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail  before  CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region.
              If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation  doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack op-
              eration  can  fail  before CloudFormation stops the operation in
              that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region,  CloudFor-
              mation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of accounts in which to perform this opera-
              tion at one time. This is dependent on the value of  FailureTol-
              eranceCount .``MaxConcurrentCount`` is at most one more than the
              FailureToleranceCount .

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this  op-
              eration at one time.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number  as  one  in-
              stead.

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionConcurrencyType=string,RegionOrder=string,string,FailureToleranceCount=integer,FailureTolerancePercentage=integer,MaxConcurrentCount=integer,MaxConcurrentPercentage=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RegionConcurrencyType": "SEQUENTIAL"|"PARALLEL",
            "RegionOrder": ["string", ...],
            "FailureToleranceCount": integer,
            "FailureTolerancePercentage": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentCount": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentPercentage": integer
          }

       --operation-id (string)
          A unique, user defined, identifier for the stack set operation.

       --call-as (string)
          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o For service managed stack sets, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the stack set operation.
