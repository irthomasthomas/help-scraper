DESCRIBE-STACK-EVENTS()                                DESCRIBE-STACK-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-stack-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all  stack  related  events  for  a specified stack in reverse
       chronological order. For more information about a  stack's  event  his-
       tory,  see  CloudFormation  stack creation events in the CloudFormation
       User Guide .

       NOTE:
          You can list events for stacks that have failed to  create  or  have
          been deleted by specifying the unique stack identifier (stack ID).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-stack-events  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: StackEvents

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name or the unique stack ID that's associated  with  the  stack,
          which aren't always interchangeable:

          o Running  stacks:  You  can  specify either the stack's name or its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       StackEvents -> (list)
          A list of StackEvents structures.

          (structure)
              The StackEvent data type.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The unique ID name of the instance of the stack.

              EventId -> (string)
                 The unique ID of this event.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The name associated with a stack.

              LogicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

              PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The name or unique identifier associated  with  the  physical
                 instance of the resource.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 Type  of  resource.  (For  more information, go to Amazon Web
                 Services Resource Types Reference in the CloudFormation  User
                 Guide .)

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Time the status was updated.

              ResourceStatus -> (string)
                 Current status of the resource.

              ResourceStatusReason -> (string)
                 Success/failure message associated with the resource.

              ResourceProperties -> (string)
                 BLOB of the properties used to create the resource.

              ClientRequestToken -> (string)
                 The token passed to the operation that generated this event.

                 All  events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned
                 the same client request token, which you can use to track op-
                 erations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation
                 with the token token1 , then all the StackEvents generated by
                 that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1 .

                 In  the  console, stack operations display the client request
                 token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are  initiated
                 from  the  console  use  the token format Console-StackOpera-
                 tion-ID , which helps you easily identify the stack operation
                 .  For example, if you create a stack using the console, each
                 stack event would be assigned the same token in the following
                 format:                                      Console-CreateS-
                 tack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002 .

              HookType -> (string)
                 The name of the hook.

              HookStatus -> (string)
                 Provides the status of the change set hook.

              HookStatusReason -> (string)
                 Provides the reason for the hook status.

              HookInvocationPoint -> (string)
                 Invocation points are  points  in  provisioning  logic  where
                 hooks are initiated.

              HookFailureMode -> (string)
                 Specify  the hook failure mode for non-compliant resources in
                 the followings ways.

                 o FAIL Stops provisioning resources.

                 o WARN Allows provisioning to continue with  a  warning  mes-
                   sage.

              DetailedStatus -> (string)
                 An  optional  field containing information about the detailed
                 status of the stack event.

                 o CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE - all of the resources in the  stack
                   have   reached   that  event.  For  more  information,  see
                   CloudFormation stack deployment in the CloudFormation  User
                   Guide .

                 o VALIDATION_FAILED  -  template validation failed because of
                   invalid properties in the template. The  ResourceStatusRea-
                   son field shows what properties are defined incorrectly.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  output  exceeds  1 MB in size, a string that identifies the
          next page of events. If no additional page  exists,  this  value  is
          null.
