OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  or  unique ID of the stack set that you want to get auto-
          matic deployment targets for.

       --next-token (string)
          A string that identifies the next page of stack set deployment  tar-
          gets that you want to retrieve.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If
          the number of available results exceeds this maximum,  the  response
          includes  a NextToken value that you can assign to the NextToken re-
          quest parameter to get the next set of results.

       --call-as (string)
          Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in  the
          organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in
          a member account.

          By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for StackSets with self-man-
          aged permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          An array of summaries of the deployment targets for the stack set.

          (structure)
              One  of  the  targets  for  the  stack  set.  Returned  by   the
              ListStackSetAutoDeploymentTargets API operation.

              OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
                 The  organization  root  ID  or  organizational unit (OU) IDs
                 where the stack set is targeted.

              Regions -> (list)
                 The list of Regions targeted for this organization or OU.

                 (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all the remaining  results,  NextToken
          is  set  to  a  token.  To  retrieve  the  next set of results, call
          ListStackSetAutoDeploymentTargets again and use that value  for  the
          NextToken  parameter.  If the request returns all results, NextToken
          is set to an empty string.
