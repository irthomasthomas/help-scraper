TEST-TYPE()                                                        TEST-TYPE()



NAME
       test-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests  a  registered  extension to make sure it meets all necessary re-
       quirements for being published in the CloudFormation registry.

       o For resource types, this includes passing all contracts tests defined
         for the type.

       o For  modules,  this  includes determining if the module's model meets
         all necessary requirements.

       For more information, see Testing your public extension prior  to  pub-
       lishing in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide .

       If you don't specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default version
       of the extension in your account and Region for testing.

       To perform testing, CloudFormation assumes the execution role specified
       when  the type was registered. For more information, see ` RegisterType
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html`__
       .

       Once  you've initiated testing on an extension using TestType , you can
       pass    the    returned    TypeVersionArn    into    `     DescribeType
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html`__
       to monitor the current test status and test status description for  the
       extension.

       An  extension  must  have a test status of PASSED before it can be pub-
       lished. For more information, see Publishing extensions  to  make  them
       available for public use in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

          Conditional: You must specify Arn , or TypeName and Type .

       --type (string)
          The type of the extension to test.

          Conditional: You must specify Arn , or TypeName and Type .

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

          o HOOK

       --type-name (string)
          The name of the extension to test.

          Conditional: You must specify Arn , or TypeName and Type .

       --version-id (string)
          The version of the extension to test.

          You  can  specify  the version id with either Arn , or with TypeName
          and Type .

          If you don't specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default ver-
          sion of the extension in this account and Region for testing.

       --log-delivery-bucket (string)
          The S3 bucket to which CloudFormation delivers the contract test ex-
          ecution logs.

          CloudFormation delivers the logs by the time  contract  testing  has
          completed  and the extension has been assigned a test type status of
          PASSED or FAILED .

          The user calling TestType must be able to access items in the speci-
          fied  S3  bucket. Specifically, the user needs the following permis-
          sions:

          o GetObject

          o PutObject

          For more information, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for
          Amazon  S3 in the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To test an extension

       The following test-type example tests a registered  extension  to  make
       sure  it  meets  all  necessary requirements for being published in the
       CloudFormation registry.

          aws cloudformation test-type \
              --arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/resource/Sample-Test-Resource123/00000001

       Output:

          {
              "TypeVersionArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/resource/Sample-Test-Resource123/00000001"
          }

       For more information, see Using the AWS CloudFormation registry in  the
       AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

OUTPUT
       TypeVersionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.
