UPDATE-STACK-INSTANCES()                              UPDATE-STACK-INSTANCES()



NAME
       update-stack-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the parameter values for stack instances for the specified ac-
       counts, within the specified Amazon Web Services Regions. A  stack  in-
       stance refers to a stack in a specific account and Region.

       You  can only update stack instances in Amazon Web Services Regions and
       accounts where they already  exist;  to  create  additional  stack  in-
       stances, use CreateStackInstances .

       During  stack  set  updates,  any parameters overridden for a stack in-
       stance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value.

       You can only update the parameter values  that  are  specified  in  the
       stack  set;  to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to
       update the stack set template. If you add a parameter  to  a  template,
       before  you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set
       you must first use UpdateStackSet to update all  stack  instances  with
       the  updated  template  and parameter value specified in the stack set.
       Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter, you  can
       then override the parameter value using UpdateStackInstances .

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set associated with the stack in-
          stances.

       --accounts (list)
          [Self-managed permissions] The names of one or more Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices  accounts  for  which  you want to update parameter values for
          stack instances. The overridden parameter values will be applied  to
          all  stack  instances  in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Regions.

          You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets , but not both.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deployment-targets (structure)
          [Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts  for  which
          you want to update parameter values for stack instances. If your up-
          date targets OUs, the overridden parameter values only apply to  the
          accounts  that  are currently in the target OUs and their child OUs.
          Accounts added to the target OUs and their child OUs in  the  future
          won't use the overridden values.

          You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets , but not both.

          Accounts -> (list)
              The  names of one or more Amazon Web Services accounts for which
              you want to deploy stack set updates.

              (string)

          AccountsUrl -> (string)
              Returns the value of the AccountsUrl property.

          OrganizationalUnitIds -> (list)
              The organization root ID or  organizational  unit  (OU)  IDs  to
              which StackSets deploys.

              (string)

          AccountFilterType -> (string)
              Limit deployment targets to individual accounts or include addi-
              tional accounts with provided OUs.

              The following is a list of possible values for  the  AccountFil-
              terType operation.

              o INTERSECTION  : StackSets deploys to the accounts specified in
                Accounts parameter.

              o DIFFERENCE : StackSets excludes the accounts specified in  Ac-
                counts  parameter. This enables user to avoid certain accounts
                within an OU such as suspended accounts.

              o UNION : (default value) StackSets includes additional accounts
                deployment  targets.  This is the default value if AccountFil-
                terType is not provided. This enables user to update an entire
                OU and individual accounts from a different OU in one request,
                which used to be two separate requests.

              o NONE : Deploys to all the accounts in specified organizational
                units (OU).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Accounts=string,string,AccountsUrl=string,OrganizationalUnitIds=string,string,AccountFilterType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Accounts": ["string", ...],
            "AccountsUrl": "string",
            "OrganizationalUnitIds": ["string", ...],
            "AccountFilterType": "NONE"|"INTERSECTION"|"DIFFERENCE"|"UNION"
          }

       --regions (list)
          The  names  of  one or more Amazon Web Services Regions in which you
          want to update parameter values for stack instances. The  overridden
          parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the spec-
          ified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --parameter-overrides (list)
          A list of input parameters whose values you want to update  for  the
          specified stack instances.

          Any  overridden  parameter  values  will be applied to all stack in-
          stances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web  Services  Regions.
          When  specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how Cloud-
          Formation sets parameter values during stack instance update  opera-
          tions:

          o To override the current value for a parameter, include the parame-
            ter and specify its value.

          o To leave an overridden parameter set to its present value, include
            the  parameter  and  specify UsePreviousValue as true . (You can't
            specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue to true .)

          o To set an overridden parameter back to the value specified in  the
            stack  set, specify a parameter list but don't include the parame-
            ter in the list.

          o To leave all parameters set to their present values, don't specify
            this property at all.

          During  stack  set  updates,  any  parameter values overridden for a
          stack instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value.

          You can only override the parameter values that are specified in the
          stack  set;  to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet
          to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to  a  tem-
          plate,  before you can override the parameter value specified in the
          stack set you must first use UpdateStackSet to update all stack  in-
          stances  with  the updated template and parameter value specified in
          the stack set. Once a stack instance has been updated with  the  new
          parameter,  you can then override the parameter value using UpdateS-
          tackInstances .

          (structure)
              The Parameter data type.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a
                 key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses
                 the default value that's specified in your template.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The input value associated with the parameter.

              UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                 During a stack update, use the existing parameter value  that
                 the  stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify
                 true , do not specify a parameter value.

              ResolvedValue -> (string)
                 Read-only. The value that corresponds to a SSM parameter key.
                 This     field     is     returned    only    for    `    SSM
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types`__
                 parameter types in the template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ParameterKey=string,ParameterValue=string,UsePreviousValue=boolean,ResolvedValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ParameterKey": "string",
              "ParameterValue": "string",
              "UsePreviousValue": true|false,
              "ResolvedValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          Preferences  for  how  CloudFormation performs this stack set opera-
          tion.

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The concurrency type of deploying StackSets  operations  in  Re-
              gions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The  order of the Regions in where you want to perform the stack
              operation.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail  before  CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region.
              If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation  doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack op-
              eration  can  fail  before CloudFormation stops the operation in
              that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region,  CloudFor-
              mation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of accounts in which to perform this opera-
              tion at one time. This is dependent on the value of  FailureTol-
              eranceCount .``MaxConcurrentCount`` is at most one more than the
              FailureToleranceCount .

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this  op-
              eration at one time.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number  as  one  in-
              stead.

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionConcurrencyType=string,RegionOrder=string,string,FailureToleranceCount=integer,FailureTolerancePercentage=integer,MaxConcurrentCount=integer,MaxConcurrentPercentage=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RegionConcurrencyType": "SEQUENTIAL"|"PARALLEL",
            "RegionOrder": ["string", ...],
            "FailureToleranceCount": integer,
            "FailureTolerancePercentage": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentCount": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentPercentage": integer
          }

       --operation-id (string)
          The unique identifier for this stack set operation.

          The  operation  ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure
          that CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even
          if  you  retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set
          operation requests to ensure that  CloudFormation  successfully  re-
          ceived them.

          If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automat-
          ically.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update stack instances

       The following update-stack-instances example retries an update on stack
       instances in two accounts in two regions with the most recent settings.
       The  specified  fault  tolerance setting ensures that the update is at-
       tempted in all accounts and regions, even if some stacks cannot be  up-
       dated.

          aws cloudformation update-stack-instances \
              --stack-set-name my-stack-set \
              --accounts 123456789012 567890123456 \
              --regions us-east-1 us-west-2 \
              --operation-preferences FailureToleranceCount=3

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "103ebdf2-21ea-xmpl-8892-de5e30733132"
          }

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for this stack set operation.
