DESCRIBE-TABLE()                                              DESCRIBE-TABLE()



NAME
       describe-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  detailed information about a table from metadata in the
       cluster. The information includes its columns. A token is  returned  to
       page  through  the  column list. Depending on the authorization method,
       use one of the following combinations of request parameters:

       o Secrets Manager - when connecting  to  a  cluster,  provide  the  se-
         cret-arn of a secret stored in Secrets Manager which has username and
         password . The specified secret contains credentials  to  connect  to
         the  database  you specify. When you are connecting to a cluster, you
         also supply the database name, If you provide  a  cluster  identifier
         (dbClusterIdentifier  ),  it must match the cluster identifier stored
         in the secret. When you are connecting to a serverless workgroup, you
         also supply the database name.

       o Temporary  credentials  -  when  connecting  to  your data warehouse,
         choose one of the following options:

         o When connecting to a serverless workgroup,  specify  the  workgroup
           name  and database name. The database user name is derived from the
           IAM identity. For example, arn:iam::123456789012:user:foo  has  the
           database  user  name  IAM:foo  .  Also, permission to call the red-
           shift-serverless:GetCredentials operation is required.

         o When connecting to a cluster as an IAM identity, specify the  clus-
           ter identifier and the database name. The database user name is de-
           rived     from     the     IAM     identity.      For      example,
           arn:iam::123456789012:user:foo has the database user name IAM:foo .
           Also, permission to call the  redshift:GetClusterCredentialsWithIAM
           operation is required.

         o When  connecting to a cluster as a database user, specify the clus-
           ter identifier, the database name,  and  the  database  user  name.
           Also,  permission to call the redshift:GetClusterCredentials opera-
           tion is required.

       describe-table is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ColumnList

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The  cluster  identifier. This parameter is required when connecting
          to a cluster and authenticating using either Secrets Manager or tem-
          porary credentials.

       --connected-database (string)
          A  database  name. The connected database is specified when you con-
          nect with your authentication credentials.

       --database (string)
          The name of the database that contains the tables to  be  described.
          If  ConnectedDatabase is not specified, this is also the database to
          connect to with your authentication credentials.

       --db-user (string)
          The database user name. This parameter is required  when  connecting
          to  a  cluster as a database user and authenticating using temporary
          credentials.

       --schema (string)
          The schema that contains the table. If no schema is specified,  then
          matching tables for all schemas are returned.

       --secret-arn (string)
          The  name  or ARN of the secret that enables access to the database.
          This parameter is required when authenticating  using  Secrets  Man-
          ager.

       --table (string)
          The  table  name.  If no table is specified, then all tables for all
          matching schemas are returned. If no table and no schema  is  speci-
          fied, then all tables for all schemas in the database are returned

       --workgroup-name (string)
          The  serverless  workgroup  name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This
          parameter is required when connecting to a serverless workgroup  and
          authenticating  using  either  Secrets  Manager or temporary creden-
          tials.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

                 The name of the column.

              nullable -> (integer)

          A value that indicates the starting point for the next  set  of  re-
          sponse  records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a
          response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this
          returned  NextToken value in the next NextToken parameter and retry-
          ing the command. If the  NextToken  field  is  empty,  all  response
          records have been retrieved for the request.
