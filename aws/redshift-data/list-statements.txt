LIST-STATEMENTS()                                            LIST-STATEMENTS()



NAME
       list-statements -

DESCRIPTION
       List of SQL statements. By default, only finished statements are shown.
       A token is returned to page through the statement list.

       list-statements is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Statements

OPTIONS
       --role-level | --no-role-level (boolean)
          A  value that filters which statements to return in the response. If
          true, all statements run by the caller's IAM role are  returned.  If
          false,  only  statements run by the caller's IAM role in the current
          IAM session are returned. The default is true.

       --statement-name (string)
          The name of the SQL statement specified as input  to  BatchExecuteS-
          tatement  or  ExecuteStatement  to  identify the query. You can list
          multiple statements by providing a prefix that matches the beginning
          of  the  statement name. For example, to list myStatement1, myState-
          ment2, myStatement3, and so on, then provide the a value of myState-
          ment  .  Data API does a case-sensitive match of SQL statement names
          to the prefix value you provide.

       --status (string)
          The status of the SQL statement to list. Status values  are  defined
          as follows:

          o ABORTED - The query run was stopped by the user.

          o ALL  - A status value that includes all query statuses. This value
            can be used to filter results.

          o FAILED - The query run failed.

          o FINISHED - The query has finished running.

          o PICKED - The query has been chosen to be run.

          o STARTED - The query run has started.

          o SUBMITTED - The query was submitted, but not yet processed.

          Possible values:

          o SUBMITTED

          o PICKED

          o STARTED

          o FINISHED

          o ABORTED

          o FAILED

          o ALL

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A  value  that  indicates the starting point for the next set of re-
          sponse records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in  a
          response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this
          returned NextToken value in the next NextToken parameter and  retry-
          ing  the  command.  If  the  NextToken  field is empty, all response
          records have been retrieved for the request.

       Statements -> (list)
          The SQL statements.

          (structure)
              The SQL statement to run.

                 The date and time (UTC) the statement was created.

              Id -> (string)
                 The SQL statement identifier. This  value  is  a  universally
                 unique  identifier  (UUID)  generated by Amazon Redshift Data
                 API.

              IsBatchStatement -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether the statement is a batch query
                 request.

              QueryParameters -> (list)
                 The parameters used in a SQL statement.

                 (structure)
                     A parameter used in a SQL statement.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the parameter.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value of the parameter. Amazon Redshift implicitly
                        converts to the proper data type.  For  more  informa-
                        tion,  see  Data types in the Amazon Redshift Database

              QueryStrings -> (list)
                 One or more SQL statements. Each query string  in  the  array
                 corresponds to one of the queries in a batch query request.

                 (string)

              ResultFormat -> (string)
                 The data format of the result of the SQL statement.
