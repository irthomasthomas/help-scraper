CREATE-TAPE-WITH-BARCODE()                          CREATE-TAPE-WITH-BARCODE()



NAME
       create-tape-with-barcode -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a virtual tape by using your own barcode. You write data to the
       virtual tape and then archive the tape. A barcode is unique and  cannot
       be  reused  if it has already been used on a tape. This applies to bar-
       codes used on deleted tapes. This operation is only  supported  in  the
       tape gateway type.

       NOTE:
          Cache storage must be allocated to the gateway before you can create
          a virtual tape. Use the  AddCache operation to add cache storage  to
          a gateway.

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that represents the gateway to
          associate the virtual tape with. Use the  ListGateways operation  to
          return  a  list of gateways for your account and Amazon Web Services
          Region.

       --tape-size-in-bytes (long)
          The size, in bytes, of the virtual tape that you want to create.

          NOTE:
              The size must be aligned by gigabyte (1024*1024*1024 bytes).

       --tape-barcode (string)
          The barcode that you want to assign to the tape.

          NOTE:
              Barcodes cannot be reused. This includes barcodes used for tapes
              that have been deleted.

       --kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted (boolean)
          Set  to  true  to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your own
          KMS key, or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --kms-key (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric  customer  master  key
          (CMK)  used  for  Amazon  S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway
          does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only  be  set  when
          KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

       --pool-id (string)
          The  ID of the pool that you want to add your tape to for archiving.
          The tape in this pool is archived in the S3 storage  class  that  is
          associated  with  the  pool. When you use your backup application to
          eject the tape, the tape is archived directly into the storage class
          (S3 Glacier or S3 Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.

       --worm | --no-worm (boolean)
          Set  to  TRUE  if the tape you are creating is to be configured as a
          write-once-read-many (WORM) tape.

       --tags (list)
          A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to a virtual tape  that
          has a barcode. Each tag is a key-value pair.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers representable in UTF-8 format, and  the  following  special
              characters:  +  - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a tag's key
              is 128 characters, and the maximum length for a tag's  value  is
              256.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that helps you manage, filter, and search for
              your resource. Allowed characters:  letters,  white  space,  and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
