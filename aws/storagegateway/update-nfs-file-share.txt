NAME
       update-nfs-file-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a Network File System (NFS) file share. This operation is only
       supported in S3 File Gateways.

       NOTE:
          To leave a file share field unchanged, set the  corresponding  input
          field to null.

       Updates the following file share settings:

       o Default storage class for your S3 bucket

       o Metadata defaults for your S3 bucket

       o Allowed NFS clients for your file share

       o Squash settings

       o Write status of your file share

OPTIONS
       --file-share-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share to be updated.

       --kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted (boolean)
          Set  to  true  to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your own
          KMS key, or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --kms-key (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric  customer  master  key
          (CMK)  used  for  Amazon  S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway
          does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only  be  set  when
          KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

       --nfs-file-share-defaults (structure)
          The default values for the file share. Optional.

          FileMode -> (string)
              The  Unix file mode in the form "nnnn". For example, 0666 repre-
              sents the default file mode inside the file share.  The  default
              value is 0666 .

          DirectoryMode -> (string)
              The  Unix  directory  mode in the form "nnnn". For example, 0666
              represents the default access mode for  all  directories  inside
              the file share. The default value is 0777 .

          GroupId -> (long)
              The  default  group ID for the file share (unless the files have
              another group ID specified). The default value is nfsnobody .

          OwnerId -> (long)
              The default owner ID for files in the  file  share  (unless  the
              files have another owner ID specified). The default value is nf-
              snobody .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FileMode=string,DirectoryMode=string,GroupId=long,OwnerId=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FileMode": "string",
            "DirectoryMode": "string",
            "GroupId": long,
            "OwnerId": long
          }

       --default-storage-class (string)
          The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon  S3  bucket
          by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is S3_STANDARD . Optional.

          Valid  Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING | S3_STANDARD_IA
          | S3_ONEZONE_IA

       --object-acl (string)
          A value that sets the access control list (ACL) permission  for  ob-
          jects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into. The
          default value is private .

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public-read

          o public-read-write

          o authenticated-read

          o bucket-owner-read

          o bucket-owner-full-control

          o aws-exec-read

       --client-list (list)
          The list of clients that are allowed to access the S3 File  Gateway.
          The  list  must  contain  either  valid  IP  addresses or valid CIDR
          blocks.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --squash (string)
          The user mapped to anonymous user.

          Valid values are the following:

          o RootSquash : Only root is mapped to anonymous user.

          o NoSquash : No one is mapped to anonymous user.

          o AllSquash : Everyone is mapped to anonymous user.

       --read-only | --no-read-only (boolean)
          A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set  this  value
          to true to set the write status to read-only, otherwise set to false
          .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --guess-mime-type-enabled | --no-guess-mime-type-enabled (boolean)
          A value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded  objects
          based on file extensions. Set this value to true to enable MIME type
          guessing, otherwise set to false . The default value is true .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --requester-pays | --no-requester-pays (boolean)
          A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost  as-
          sociated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set
          to true , the requester pays the costs;  otherwise,  the  S3  bucket
          owner  pays.  However,  the  S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of
          storing data.

          NOTE:
              RequesterPays is a configuration for the S3  bucket  that  backs
              the  file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file
              share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --file-share-name (string)
          The name of the file share. Optional.

          NOTE:
              FileShareName must be set if an S3 prefix name is set  in  Loca-
              tionARN , or if an access point or access point alias is used.

       --cache-attributes (structure)
          Specifies refresh cache information for the file share.

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              Refreshes  a file share's cache by using Time To Live (TTL). TTL
              is the length of time since the last refresh after which  access
              to  the  directory would cause the file gateway to first refresh
              that directory's contents from the Amazon S3  bucket  or  Amazon
              FSx file system. The TTL duration is in seconds.

              Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30 days)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds": integer
          }

       --notification-policy (string)
          The  notification  policy  of  the file share. SettlingTimeInSeconds
          controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in  time
          a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notifi-
          cation. Because clients can make many small writes  to  files,  it's
          best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generat-
          ing multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

          NOTE:
              SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the  object
              uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.

          The  following  example  sets  NotificationPolicy  on with Settling-
          TimeInSeconds set to 60.
              {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}

          The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.
              {}

       --audit-destination-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit logs.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
