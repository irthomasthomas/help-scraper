ATTACH-VOLUME()                                                ATTACH-VOLUME()



NAME
       attach-volume -

DESCRIPTION
       Connects  a  volume to an iSCSI connection and then attaches the volume
       to the specified gateway. Detaching and attaching a volume enables  you
       to  recover  your  data from one gateway to a different gateway without
       creating a snapshot. It also makes it easier to move your volumes  from
       an on-premises gateway to a gateway hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance.

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway that you want to at-
          tach the volume to.

       --target-name (string)
          The name of the iSCSI target used by an initiator to  connect  to  a
          volume  and used as a suffix for the target ARN. For example, speci-
          fying  TargetName  as  myvolume  results  in  the  target   ARN   of
          arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-2:111122223333:gate-
          way/sgw-12A3456B/target/iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume . The target
          name must be unique across all volumes on a gateway.

          If  you  don't  specify a value, Storage Gateway uses the value that
          was previously used for this volume as the new target name.

       --volume-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume to attach to the speci-
          fied gateway.

       --network-interface-id (string)
          The  network  interface  of the gateway on which to expose the iSCSI
          target. Only IPv4 addresses are accepted. Use  DescribeGatewayInfor-
          mation  to get a list of the network interfaces available on a gate-
          way.

          Valid Values: A valid IP address.

       --disk-id (string)
          The unique device ID or other distinguishing  data  that  identifies
          the  local  disk  used  to create the volume. This value is only re-
          quired when you are attaching a stored volume.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       VolumeARN -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the volume that was attached to
          the gateway.

       TargetARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume target, which  includes
          the  iSCSI  name  for  the initiator that was used to connect to the
          target.
