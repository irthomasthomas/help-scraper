OPTIONS
       --file-share-arn-list (list)
          An  array  containing  the  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of each file
          share to be described.

          (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SMBFileShareInfoList -> (list)
          An array containing a description for each requested file share.

          (structure)
              The Windows file permissions and ownership information assigned,
              by default, to native S3 objects when S3 File Gateway  discovers
              them in S3 buckets. This operation is only supported for S3 File
              Gateways.

              FileShareARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share.

              FileShareId -> (string)
                 The ID of the file share.

              FileShareStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the file share.

                 Valid Values: CREATING | UPDATING | AVAILABLE | DELETING

              GatewayARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  List-
                 Gateways  operation to return a list of gateways for your ac-
                 count and Amazon Web Services Region.

              EncryptionType -> (string)
                 A value that specifies the  type  of  server-side  encryption
                 that  the  file share will use for the data that it stores in
                 Amazon S3.

                 NOTE:
                     We recommend using EncryptionType instead of KMSEncrypted
                     to  set the file share encryption method. You do not need
                     to provide values for both parameters.

                     If values for both parameters exist in the same  request,
                     then  the specified encryption methods must not conflict.
                     For example, if EncryptionType is  SseS3  ,  then  KMSEn-
                     crypted  must  be  false . If EncryptionType is SseKms or
                     DsseKms , then KMSEncrypted must be true .

              KMSEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 Optional. Set to true to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption
                 with  your  own KMS key (SSE-KMS), or false to use a key man-
                 aged by Amazon S3  (SSE-S3).  To  use  dual-layer  encryption
                 (DSSE-KMS), set the EncryptionType parameter instead.

                 NOTE:
                     We recommend using EncryptionType instead of KMSEncrypted
                     to set the file share encryption method. You do not  need
                     to provide values for both parameters.

                     If  values for both parameters exist in the same request,
                     then the specified encryption methods must not  conflict.
                     For  example,  if  EncryptionType  is SseS3 , then KMSEn-
                     crypted must be false . If EncryptionType  is  SseKms  or
                     DsseKms , then KMSEncrypted must be true .

                 Valid Values: true | false

              KMSKey -> (string)
                 Optional.  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric cus-
                 tomer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryp-
                 tion.  Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This
                 value must be set if KMSEncrypted is true , or if Encryption-
                 Type is SseKms or DsseKms .

              Path -> (string)
                 The  file  share  path used by the SMB client to identify the
                 mount point.

              Role -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IAM role that an S3 File Gateway assumes  when
                 it accesses the underlying storage.

              LocationARN -> (string)
                 A  custom  ARN  for the backend storage used for storing data
                 for file shares. It includes a resource ARN with an  optional
                 prefix  concatenation.  The  prefix  must  end with a forward
                 slash (/).

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify LocationARN as a bucket ARN, access point
                     ARN  or access point alias, as shown in the following ex-
                     amples.

                     Bucket ARN:
                        arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/prefix/

                     Access point ARN:
                        arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/ac-
                        cess-point-name/prefix/

                     If you specify an access point, the bucket policy must be
                     configured to  delegate  access  control  to  the  access
                     point.  For information, see Delegating access control to
                     access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     Access point alias:
                        test-ap-ab123cdef4gehijklmn5opqrstuvuse1a-s3alias

              DefaultStorageClass -> (string)
                 The default storage class for objects put into an  Amazon  S3
                 bucket  by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is S3_STAN-
                 DARD . Optional.

                 Valid Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING | S3_STAN-
                 DARD_IA | S3_ONEZONE_IA

              ObjectACL -> (string)
                 A  value  that  sets the access control list (ACL) permission
                 for objects in the S3 bucket that an S3 File Gateway puts ob-
                 jects into. The default value is private .

              ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                 A  value that sets the write status of a file share. Set this
                 value to true to set the write status to read-only, otherwise
                 set to false .

                 Valid Values: true | false

              GuessMIMETypeEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded
                 objects based on file extensions. Set this value to  true  to
                 enable  MIME  type guessing, otherwise set to false . The de-
                 fault value is true .

                 Valid Values: true | false

              RequesterPays -> (boolean)
                 A value that sets who pays the cost of the  request  and  the
                 cost  associated  with  data  download from the S3 bucket. If
                 this value is set to true , the  requester  pays  the  costs;
                 otherwise,  the  S3 bucket owner pays. However, the S3 bucket
                 owner always pays the cost of storing data.

                 NOTE:
                     RequesterPays is a configuration for the S3  bucket  that
                     backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration
                     on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configura-
                     tion.

                 Valid Values: true | false

              SMBACLEnabled -> (boolean)
                 If  this value is set to true , it indicates that access con-
                 trol list (ACL) is enabled on the SMB file share.  If  it  is
                 set  to  false , it indicates that file and directory permis-
                 sions are mapped to the POSIX permission.

                 For more information, see Using Windows  ACLs  to  limit  SMB
                 file share access in the Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide .

              AccessBasedEnumeration -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether AccessBasedEnumeration is enabled.

              AdminUserList -> (list)
                 A  list  of users or groups in the Active Directory that have
                 administrator rights to the file share. A group must be  pre-
                 fixed  with  the @ character. Acceptable formats include: DO-
                 MAIN\User1 , user1 , @group1 , and @DOMAIN\group1 . Can  only
                 be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory .

                 (string)

              ValidUserList -> (list)
                 A  list  of  users or groups in the Active Directory that are
                 allowed to access the file share. A group  must  be  prefixed
                 with   the  @  character.  Acceptable  formats  include:  DO-
                 MAIN\User1 , user1 , @group1 , and @DOMAIN\group1 . Can  only
                 be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory .

                 (string)

              InvalidUserList -> (list)
                 A  list  of  users or groups in the Active Directory that are
                 not allowed to access the file share. A group  must  be  pre-
                 fixed  with  the @ character. Acceptable formats include: DO-
                 MAIN\User1 , user1 , @group1 , and @DOMAIN\group1 . Can  only
                 be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory .

              AuditDestinationARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit
                 logs.

              Authentication -> (string)
                 The authentication method of the file share. The  default  is
                 ActiveDirectory .

                 Valid Values: ActiveDirectory | GuestAccess

              CaseSensitivity -> (string)
                 The  case  of  an  object  name  in  an Amazon S3 bucket. For
                 ClientSpecified , the client determines the case sensitivity.
                 For CaseSensitive , the gateway determines the case sensitiv-
                 ity. The default value is ClientSpecified .

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of up to 50 tags  assigned  to  the  SMB  file  share,
                 sorted  alphabetically  by  key name. Each tag is a key-value
                 pair. For a gateway with more than 10 tags assigned, you  can
                 view all tags using the ListTagsForResource API operation.

                 (structure)
                     A  key-value  pair  that  helps  you  manage, filter, and
                     search for your resource.  Allowed  characters:  letters,
                     white space, and numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the
                     following characters: + - = . _ : /.

                     Key -> (string)

              FileShareName -> (string)
                 The name of the file share. Optional.

                 NOTE:
                     FileShareName must be set if an S3 prefix name is set  in
                     LocationARN , or if an access point or access point alias
                     is used.

              CacheAttributes -> (structure)
                 Refresh cache information for the file share.

                 CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Refreshes a file share's cache  by  using  Time  To  Live
                     (TTL).  TTL  is the length of time since the last refresh
                     after which access to the directory would cause the  file
                     gateway  to  first refresh that directory's contents from
                     the Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon FSx file system.  The  TTL
                     duration is in seconds.

                     Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30
                     days)

              NotificationPolicy -> (string)
                 The notification policy of the file share. SettlingTimeInSec-
                 onds  controls  the  number of seconds to wait after the last
                 point in time a client wrote to a file before  generating  an
                 ObjectUploaded  notification.  Because  clients can make many
                 small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as
                 long  as  possible to avoid generating multiple notifications
                 for the same file in a small time period.

                 NOTE:
                        SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the  timing  of
                        the  object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of
                        the notification.

                     This setting is not meant to specify  an  exact  time  at
                     which  the  notification will be sent. In some cases, the
                     gateway might require more than the specified delay  time
                     to generate and send notifications.

                 The  following  example  sets NotificationPolicy on with Set-
                 tlingTimeInSeconds set to 60.
                     {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}

                 The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.
                     {}

              VPCEndpointDNSName -> (string)
                 Specifies the DNS name for the VPC endpoint that the SMB file
                 share uses to connect to Amazon S3.

                 NOTE:
                     This  parameter is required for SMB file shares that con-
                     nect to Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint,  a  VPC  access
                     point,  or an access point alias that points to a VPC ac-
                     cess point.

              BucketRegion -> (string)
                 Specifies the Region of the S3  bucket  where  the  SMB  file
                 share stores files.

                 NOTE:
                     This  parameter is required for SMB file shares that con-
                     nect to Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint,  a  VPC  access
                     point,  or an access point alias that points to a VPC ac-
                     cess point.
