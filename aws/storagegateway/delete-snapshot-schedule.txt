NAME
       delete-snapshot-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a snapshot of a volume.

       You can take snapshots of your gateway volumes on a scheduled or ad hoc
       basis. This API action enables you to delete a snapshot schedule for  a
       volume.  For  more  information,  see  Backing up your volumes . In the
       DeleteSnapshotSchedule request, you identify the  volume  by  providing
       its  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN). This operation is only supported for
       cached volume gateway types.

       NOTE:
          To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2  API.  For
          more information, go to DescribeSnapshots in the Amazon Elastic Com-
          pute Cloud API Reference .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-snapshot-schedule
          --volume-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --volume-arn (string)
          The volume which snapshot schedule to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       VolumeARN -> (string)
          The volume which snapshot schedule was deleted.
