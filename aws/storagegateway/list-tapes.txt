LIST-TAPES()                                                      LIST-TAPES()



NAME
       list-tapes -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists virtual tapes in your virtual tape library (VTL) and your virtual
       tape shelf (VTS). You specify the tapes to list by  specifying  one  or
       more  tape  Amazon  Resource  Names (ARNs). If you don't specify a tape
       ARN, the operation lists all virtual tapes in both your VTL and VTS.

       This operation supports pagination. By default, the operation returns a
       maximum of up to 100 tapes. You can optionally specify the Limit param-
       eter in the body to limit the number of tapes in the response.  If  the
       number of tapes returned in the response is truncated, the response in-
       cludes a Marker element that you can use in your subsequent request  to
       retrieve the next set of tapes. This operation is only supported in the
       tape gateway type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-tapes is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: TapeInfos

OPTIONS
       --tape-arns (list)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of each of the tapes you want to
          list. If you don't specify a tape ARN, the response lists all  tapes
          in both your VTL and VTS.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TapeInfos -> (list)
          An  array of  TapeInfo objects, where each object describes a single
          tape. If there are no tapes in the tape library  or  VTS,  then  the
          TapeInfos is an empty array.

          (structure)
              Describes a virtual tape.

              TapeARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a virtual tape.

              TapeBarcode -> (string)
                 The barcode that identifies a specific virtual tape.

              TapeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of a virtual tape.

              TapeStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the tape.

              GatewayARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  List-
                 Gateways operation to return a list of gateways for your  ac-
                 count and Amazon Web Services Region.

              PoolId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the pool that you want to add your tape to for ar-
                 chiving. The tape in this pool is archived in the S3  storage
                 class  that  is  associated  with the pool. When you use your
                 backup application to eject the tape, the  tape  is  archived
                 directly  into  the  storage  class (S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier
                 Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.

              RetentionStartDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the tape became subject to tape retention lock.

              PoolEntryDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the tape entered the custom tape pool with tape
                 retention lock enabled.

       Marker -> (string)
          A string that indicates the position at which to begin returning the
          next list of tapes. Use the marker in your next request to  continue
          pagination  of  tapes. If there are no more tapes to list, this ele-
          ment does not appear in the response body.
