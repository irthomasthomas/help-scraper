NAME
       update-automatic-tape-creation-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  automatic  tape creation policy of a gateway. Use this to
       update the policy with a new set of automatic tape creation rules. This
       is only supported for tape gateways.

       By default, there is no automatic tape creation policy.

       NOTE:
          A gateway can have only one automatic tape creation policy.

OPTIONS
       --automatic-tape-creation-rules (list)
          An  automatic  tape  creation policy consists of a list of automatic
          tape creation rules. The rules determine when and how  to  automati-
          cally create new tapes.

          (structure)
              An  automatic  tape  creation  policy consists of automatic tape
              creation rules where each rule defines when and  how  to  create
              new  tapes.  For more information about automatic tape creation,
              see Creating Tapes Automatically .

              TapeBarcodePrefix -> (string)
                 A prefix that you append to the barcode of the  virtual  tape
                 that you are creating. This prefix makes the barcode unique.

                 NOTE:
                     The  prefix  must be 1-4 characters in length and must be
                     one of the uppercase letters from A to Z.

              PoolId -> (string)
                 The ID of the pool that you want to add your tape to for  ar-
                 chiving.  The  tape in this pool is archived in the Amazon S3
                 storage class that is associated with the pool. When you  use
                 your  backup  application  to  eject  the  tape,  the tape is
                 archived directly into the storage class (S3  Glacier  or  S3
                 Glacier Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.

              TapeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the virtual tape capacity.

              MinimumNumTapes -> (integer)
                 The  minimum number of available virtual tapes that the gate-
                 way maintains at all times. If the number  of  tapes  on  the
                 gateway  goes  below  this value, the gateway creates as many
                 new tapes as are needed to have MinimumNumTapes on the  gate-
                 way.  For more information about automatic tape creation, see
                 Creating Tapes Automatically .

              Worm -> (boolean)
                 Set to true to indicate that tapes  are  to  be  archived  as
                 write-once-read-many  (WORM).  Set  to false when WORM is not
                 enabled for tapes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TapeBarcodePrefix=string,PoolId=string,TapeSizeInBytes=long,MinimumNumTapes=integer,Worm=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TapeBarcodePrefix": "string",
              "PoolId": "string",
              "TapeSizeInBytes": long,
              "MinimumNumTapes": integer,
              "Worm": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.
