NAME
       update-smb-security-strategy -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  SMB  security  strategy on a file gateway. This action is
       only supported in file gateways.

       NOTE:
          This API is called Security level in the User Guide.

          A higher security level can affect performance of the gateway.

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --smb-security-strategy (string)
          Specifies the type of security strategy.

          ClientSpecified: if you use this option,  requests  are  established
          based  on  what  is  negotiated by the client. This option is recom-
          mended when you want  to  maximize  compatibility  across  different
          clients in your environment. Supported only in S3 File Gateway.

          MandatorySigning:  if  you use this option, file gateway only allows
          connections from SMBv2 or SMBv3 clients that have  signing  enabled.
          This  option works with SMB clients on Microsoft Windows Vista, Win-
          dows Server 2008 or newer.

          MandatoryEncryption: if you use this option, file gateway  only  al-
          lows  connections  from  SMBv3 clients that have encryption enabled.
          This option is highly recommended for environments that handle  sen-
          sitive data. This option works with SMB clients on Microsoft Windows
          8, Windows Server 2012 or newer.

          Possible values:

          o ClientSpecified

          o MandatorySigning

          o MandatoryEncryption

          o MandatoryEncryptionNoAes128

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.
