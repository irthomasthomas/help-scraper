NAME
       describe-cache -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the  cache of a gateway. This operation is
       only supported in the cached volume, tape, and file gateway types.

       The response includes disk IDs that are configured as cache, and it in-
       cludes the amount of cache allocated and used.

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       DiskIds -> (list)
          An array of strings that identify disks that are to be configured as
          working storage. Each string has a minimum length of 1  and  maximum
          length  of  300.  You  can get the disk IDs from the  ListLocalDisks
          API.

          (string)

       CacheAllocatedInBytes -> (long)
          The amount of cache in bytes allocated to a gateway.

       CacheUsedPercentage -> (double)
          Percent use of the gateway's cache storage. This metric applies only
          to  the  gateway-cached volume setup. The sample is taken at the end
          of the reporting period.

       CacheDirtyPercentage -> (double)
          The file share's contribution to the overall percentage of the gate-
          way's  cache that has not been persisted to Amazon Web Services. The
          sample is taken at the end of the reporting period.

       CacheHitPercentage -> (double)
          Percent of application read operations from the file shares that are
          served  from  cache. The sample is taken at the end of the reporting
          period.

       CacheMissPercentage -> (double)
          Percent of application read operations from the file shares that are
          not served from cache. The sample is taken at the end of the report-
          ing period.
