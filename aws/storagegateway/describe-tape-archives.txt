DESCRIBE-TAPE-ARCHIVES()                              DESCRIBE-TAPE-ARCHIVES()



NAME
       describe-tape-archives -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  description  of specified virtual tapes in the virtual tape
       shelf (VTS). This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.

       If a specific TapeARN is not specified, Storage Gateway returns  a  de-
       scription  of  all  virtual tapes found in the VTS associated with your
       account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-tape-archives is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: TapeArchives

OPTIONS
       --tape-arns (list)
          Specifies  one or more unique Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that rep-
          resent the virtual tapes you want to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          An array of virtual tape objects in the virtual  tape  shelf  (VTS).
          The  description  includes  of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
          virtual tapes. The information returned includes the Amazon Resource
          Names  (ARNs)  of the tapes, size of the tapes, status of the tapes,
          progress of the description, and tape barcode.

              shelf (VTS).

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an archived virtual tape.

              TapeBarcode -> (string)
                 The barcode that identifies the archived virtual tape.

              TapeCreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the virtual tape was created.

              TapeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the archived virtual tape.

              CompletionTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that  the  archiving  of the virtual tape was com-
                 pleted.

              RetrievedTo -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the tape gateway that the
                 virtual tape is being retrieved to.

                 The virtual tape is retrieved from  the  virtual  tape  shelf
                 (VTS).

              TapeStatus -> (string)
                 The current state of the archived virtual tape.

              TapeUsedInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of data stored on the virtual tape.

                 NOTE:

                     May 13, 2015.

              KMSKey -> (string)
                 Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric  cus-
                 tomer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryp-
                 tion. Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs.  This
                 value must be set if KMSEncrypted is true , or if Encryption-
                 Type is SseKms or DsseKms .

              PoolId -> (string)
                 The ID of the pool that was used to  archive  the  tape.  The

                 is associated with the pool.

              Worm -> (boolean)
                 Set  to  true   if   the   archived   tape   is   stored   as
                 write-once-read-many (WORM).

              RetentionStartDate -> (timestamp)

              PoolEntryDate -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the tape entered the custom tape pool.

                 The default timestamp  format  is  in  the  ISO8601  extended
                 YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS'Z' format.

       Marker -> (string)
          An  opaque  string  that indicates the position at which the virtual
          tapes that were fetched for description ended. Use  this  marker  in
          your next request to fetch the next set of virtual tapes in the vir-
          tual tape shelf (VTS). If there are no more  virtual  tapes  to  de-
          scribe, this field does not appear in the response.
