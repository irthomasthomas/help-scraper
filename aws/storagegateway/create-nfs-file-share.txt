CREATE-NFS-FILE-SHARE()                                CREATE-NFS-FILE-SHARE()



NAME
       create-nfs-file-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  Network File System (NFS) file share on an existing S3 File
       Gateway. In Storage Gateway, a file share is a file system mount  point
       backed  by Amazon S3 cloud storage. Storage Gateway exposes file shares
       using an NFS interface. This operation is only supported  for  S3  File
       Gateways.

       WARNING:
          S3 File gateway requires Security Token Service (Amazon Web Services
          STS) to be activated to enable you to create a file share. Make sure
          Amazon  Web Services STS is activated in the Amazon Web Services Re-
          gion you are creating your S3 File Gateway in. If  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  STS is not activated in the Amazon Web Services Region, acti-
          vate it. For information about how to activate Amazon  Web  Services
          STS,  see  Activating and deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an
          Amazon Web Services Region in the  Identity  and  Access  Management
          User Guide .

          S3 File Gateways do not support creating hard or symbolic links on a
          file share.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A unique string value that you supply that is used by S3 File  Gate-
          way to ensure idempotent file share creation.

       --nfs-file-share-defaults (structure)
          File share default values. Optional.

          FileMode -> (string)
              The  Unix file mode in the form "nnnn". For example, 0666 repre-
              sents the default file mode inside the file share.  The  default
              value is 0666 .

          DirectoryMode -> (string)
              The  Unix  directory  mode in the form "nnnn". For example, 0666
              represents the default access mode for  all  directories  inside
              the file share. The default value is 0777 .

          GroupId -> (long)
              The  default  group ID for the file share (unless the files have
              another group ID specified). The default value is nfsnobody .

          OwnerId -> (long)
              The default owner ID for files in the  file  share  (unless  the
              files have another owner ID specified). The default value is nf-
              snobody .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FileMode=string,DirectoryMode=string,GroupId=long,OwnerId=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FileMode": "string",
            "DirectoryMode": "string",
            "GroupId": long,
            "OwnerId": long
          }

       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 File Gateway on  which  you
          want to create a file share.

       --encryption-type (string)
          A  value  that specifies the type of server-side encryption that the
          file share will use for the data that it stores in Amazon S3.

          NOTE:
              We recommend using EncryptionType instead of KMSEncrypted to set
              the  file  share  encryption  method. You do not need to provide
              values for both parameters.

              If values for both parameters exist in the  same  request,  then
              the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example,
              if EncryptionType is SseS3 , then KMSEncrypted must be  false  .
              If  EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms , then KMSEncrypted must
              be true .

          Possible values:

          o SseS3

          o SseKms

          o DsseKms

       --kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted (boolean)
          Optional. Set to true to use Amazon S3 server-side  encryption  with
          your  own KMS key (SSE-KMS), or false to use a key managed by Amazon
          S3 (SSE-S3). To use dual-layer encryption (DSSE-KMS),  set  the  En-
          cryptionType parameter instead.

          NOTE:
              We recommend using EncryptionType instead of KMSEncrypted to set
              the file share encryption method. You do  not  need  to  provide
              values for both parameters.

              If  values  for  both parameters exist in the same request, then
              the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example,
              if  EncryptionType  is SseS3 , then KMSEncrypted must be false .
              If EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms , then KMSEncrypted  must
              be true .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --kms-key (string)
          Optional.  The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer
          master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption.  Storage
          Gateway  does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value must be set if
          KMSEncrypted is true , or if EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms .

       --role (string)
          The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that an  S3
          File Gateway assumes when it accesses the underlying storage.

       --location-arn (string)
          A  custom ARN for the backend storage used for storing data for file
          shares. It includes a resource ARN with an optional prefix  concate-
          nation. The prefix must end with a forward slash (/).

          NOTE:
              You can specify LocationARN as a bucket ARN, access point ARN or
              access point alias, as shown in the following examples.

              Bucket ARN:
                 arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/prefix/

              Access point ARN:
                 arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/ac-
                 cess-point-name/prefix/

              If  you  specify an access point, the bucket policy must be con-
              figured to delegate access control to the access point. For  in-
              formation, see Delegating access control to access points in the
              Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Access point alias:
                 test-ap-ab123cdef4gehijklmn5opqrstuvuse1a-s3alias

       --default-storage-class (string)
          The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon  S3  bucket
          by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is S3_STANDARD . Optional.

          Valid  Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING | S3_STANDARD_IA
          | S3_ONEZONE_IA

       --object-acl (string)
          A value that sets the access control list (ACL) permission  for  ob-
          jects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into. The
          default value is private .

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public-read

          o public-read-write

          o authenticated-read

          o bucket-owner-read

          o bucket-owner-full-control

          o aws-exec-read

       --client-list (list)
          The list of clients that are allowed to access the S3 File  Gateway.
          The  list  must  contain  either  valid  IP  addresses or valid CIDR
          blocks.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --squash (string)
          A value that maps a user to anonymous user.

          Valid values are the following:

          o RootSquash : Only root is mapped to anonymous user.

          o NoSquash : No one is mapped to anonymous user.

          o AllSquash : Everyone is mapped to anonymous user.

       --read-only | --no-read-only (boolean)
          A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set  this  value
          to true to set the write status to read-only, otherwise set to false
          .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --guess-mime-type-enabled | --no-guess-mime-type-enabled (boolean)
          A value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded  objects
          based on file extensions. Set this value to true to enable MIME type
          guessing, otherwise set to false . The default value is true .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --requester-pays | --no-requester-pays (boolean)
          A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost  as-
          sociated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set
          to true , the requester pays the costs;  otherwise,  the  S3  bucket
          owner  pays.  However,  the  S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of
          storing data.

          NOTE:
              RequesterPays is a configuration for the S3  bucket  that  backs
              the  file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file
              share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --tags (list)
          A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to the NFS file  share.
          Each tag is a key-value pair.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers representable in UTF-8 format, and  the  following  special
              characters:  +  - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a tag's key
              is 128 characters, and the maximum length for a tag's  value  is
              256.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that helps you manage, filter, and search for
              your resource. Allowed characters:  letters,  white  space,  and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --file-share-name (string)
          The name of the file share. Optional.

          NOTE:
              FileShareName must be set if an S3 prefix name is set  in  Loca-
              tionARN , or if an access point or access point alias is used.

       --cache-attributes (structure)
          Specifies refresh cache information for the file share.

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              Refreshes  a file share's cache by using Time To Live (TTL). TTL
              is the length of time since the last refresh after which  access
              to  the  directory would cause the file gateway to first refresh
              that directory's contents from the Amazon S3  bucket  or  Amazon
              FSx file system. The TTL duration is in seconds.

              Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30 days)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds": integer
          }

       --notification-policy (string)
          The  notification  policy  of  the file share. SettlingTimeInSeconds
          controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in  time
          a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notifi-
          cation. Because clients can make many small writes  to  files,  it's
          best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generat-
          ing multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

          NOTE:
                 SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the  ob-
                 ject uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notifica-
                 tion.

              This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which  the
              notification  will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might re-
              quire more than the specified delay time to  generate  and  send
              notifications.

          The  following  example  sets  NotificationPolicy  on with Settling-
          TimeInSeconds set to 60.
              {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}

          The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.
              {}

       --vpc-endpoint-dns-name (string)
          Specifies the DNS name for the VPC endpoint that the NFS file  share
          uses to connect to Amazon S3.

          NOTE:
              This  parameter  is required for NFS file shares that connect to
              Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an  ac-
              cess point alias that points to a VPC access point.

       --bucket-region (string)
          Specifies  the  Region  of  the  S3  bucket where the NFS file share
          stores files.

          NOTE:
              This parameter is required for NFS file shares that  connect  to
              Amazon  S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an ac-
              cess point alias that points to a VPC access point.

       --audit-destination-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit logs.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
