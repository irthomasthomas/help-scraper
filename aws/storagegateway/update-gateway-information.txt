UPDATE-GATEWAY-INFORMATION()                      UPDATE-GATEWAY-INFORMATION()



NAME
       update-gateway-information -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a  gateway's metadata, which includes the gateway's name, time
       zone, and metadata cache size. To specify which gateway to update,  use
       the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.

       NOTE:
          For  gateways  activated  after September 2, 2015, the gateway's ARN
          contains the gateway ID  rather  than  the  gateway  name.  However,
          changing the name of the gateway has no effect on the gateway's ARN.

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --gateway-name (string)
          The name you configured for your gateway.

       --gateway-timezone (string)
          A value that indicates the time zone of the gateway.

       --cloud-watch-log-group-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the Amazon CloudWatch log group
          that you want to use to monitor and log events in the gateway.

          For more information, see What is Amazon CloudWatch Logs?

       --gateway-capacity (string)
          Specifies the size of the gateway's metadata cache. This setting im-
          pacts gateway performance and hardware recommendations. For more in-
          formation, see Performance guidance for gateways with multiple  file
          shares in the Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o Small

          o Medium

          o Large

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       GatewayName -> (string)
          The name you configured for your gateway.
