ASSOCIATE-FILE-SYSTEM()                                ASSOCIATE-FILE-SYSTEM()



NAME
       associate-file-system -

DESCRIPTION
       Associate  an  Amazon  FSx file system with the FSx File Gateway. After
       the association process is complete, the file shares on the Amazon  FSx
       file  system  are available for access through the gateway. This opera-
       tion only supports the FSx File Gateway type.

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The user name of the user credential that has permission  to  access

       --client-token (string)
          A unique string value that you supply that is used by the  FSx  File
          Gateway to ensure idempotent file system association creation.

       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --location-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon FSx file system to as-
          sociate with the FSx File Gateway.

       --tags (list)
          A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to the file system  as-
          sociation. Each tag is a key-value pair.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that helps you manage, filter, and search for
              your resource. Allowed characters:  letters,  white  space,  and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --audit-destination-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage  used  for  the  audit
          logs.

       --cache-attributes (structure)
          The  refresh  cache  information for the file share or FSx file sys-
          tems.

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              Refreshes a file share's cache by using Time To Live (TTL).  TTL
              is  the length of time since the last refresh after which access
              to the directory would cause the file gateway to  first  refresh
              that  directory's  contents  from the Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon
              FSx file system. The TTL duration is in seconds.

              Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30 days)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds": integer
          }

       --endpoint-network-configuration (structure)
          Specifies the network configuration information for the gateway  as-
          sociated with the Amazon FSx file system.

          NOTE:
              If  multiple file systems are associated with this gateway, this
              parameter's IpAddresses field is required.

          IpAddresses -> (list)
              A list of gateway IP addresses on which  the  associated  Amazon
              FSx file system is available.

              NOTE:
                 If  multiple  file  systems are associated with this gateway,
                 this field is required.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IpAddresses=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IpAddresses": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
