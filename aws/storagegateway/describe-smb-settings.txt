OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways

          Web Services Region.

       DomainName -> (string)
          The name of the domain that the gateway is joined to.

       ActiveDirectoryStatus -> (string)
          Indicates the status of a gateway that is a member of the Active Di-
          rectory domain.

          Valid Values: true | false

       SMBSecurityStrategy -> (string)
          The type of security strategy that was specified for file gateway.

          o ClientSpecified  :  If you choose this option, requests are estab-
            lished based on what is negotiated by the client. This  option  is
            recommended when you want to maximize compatibility across differ-
            ent clients in your environment. Supported only for S3 File  Gate-
            way.

          o MandatorySigning  :  If  you choose this option, File Gateway only
            allows connections from SMBv2 or SMBv3 clients that  have  signing
            turned on. This option works with SMB clients on Microsoft Windows
            Vista, Windows Server 2008, or later.

          o MandatoryEncryption : If you choose this option, File Gateway only
            allows  connections from SMBv3 clients that have encryption turned
            on. Both 256-bit and 128-bit algorithms are allowed.  This  option
            is  recommended  for  environments  that handle sensitive data. It
            works with SMB clients on  Microsoft  Windows  8,  Windows  Server

            lowed. This option is recommended  for  environments  that  handle
            sensitive  data. It works with SMB clients on Microsoft Windows 8,
            Windows Server 2012, or later.

       FileSharesVisible -> (boolean)
          The shares on this gateway appear when  listing  shares.  Only  sup-
          ported for S3 File Gateways.

       SMBLocalGroups -> (structure)
          A  list  of Active Directory users and groups that have special per-
          missions for SMB file shares on the gateway.

          GatewayAdmins -> (list)
              A list of Active Directory users  and  groups  that  have  local
              Gateway  Admin  permissions.  Acceptable  formats  include:  DO-
