RETRIEVE-TAPE-RECOVERY-POINT()                  RETRIEVE-TAPE-RECOVERY-POINT()



NAME
       retrieve-tape-recovery-point -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the recovery point for the specified virtual tape. This oper-
       ation is only supported in the tape gateway type.

       A recovery point is a point in time view of a virtual tape at which all
       the  data  on  the tape is consistent. If your gateway crashes, virtual
       tapes that have recovery points can be recovered to a new gateway.

       NOTE:
          The virtual tape can be retrieved to only one gateway. The retrieved
          tape  is read-only. The virtual tape can be retrieved to only a tape
          gateway. There is no charge for retrieving recovery points.

OPTIONS
       --tape-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the virtual  tape  for  which  you
          want to retrieve the recovery point.

       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --output (string)

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)
