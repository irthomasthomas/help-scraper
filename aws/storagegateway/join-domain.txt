OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain that you want the gateway to join.

       --organizational-unit (string)
          The organizational unit (OU) is a container in an  Active  Directory
          that  can  hold users, groups, computers, and other OUs and this pa-
          rameter specifies the OU that the gateway will join  within  the  AD
          domain.

       --domain-controllers (list)
          List  of IPv4 addresses, NetBIOS names, or host names of your domain
          server. If you need to specify the port number include it after  the
          colon (:). For example, mydc.mydomain.com:389 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --timeout-in-seconds (integer)
          Specifies  the  time  in  seconds, in which the JoinDomain operation
          must complete. The default is 20 seconds.

       --user-name (string)
          Sets the user name of user who has permission to add the gateway  to
          the  Active  Directory domain. The domain user account should be en-
          abled to join computers to the domain. For example, you can use  the
          domain  administrator  account  or an account with delegated permis-
          sions to join computers to the domain.

       --password (string)
          Sets the password of the user who has permission to add the  gateway
          to the Active Directory domain.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway that joined the
          domain.

       ActiveDirectoryStatus -> (string)
          Indicates the status of the gateway as a member of the Active Direc-
          tory domain.

          o UNKNOWN_ERROR : Indicates that the JoinDomain operation failed due
            to another type of error.
