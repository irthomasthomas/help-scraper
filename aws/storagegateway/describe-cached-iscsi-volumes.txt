NAME
       describe-cached-iscsi-volumes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a description of the gateway volumes specified in the request.
       This operation is only supported in the cached volume gateway types.

       The list of gateway volumes in the request must be from one gateway. In
       the response, Storage Gateway returns volume information sorted by vol-
       ume Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --volume-arns (list)
          An array of strings where each string represents the Amazon Resource
          Name  (ARN)  of a cached volume. All of the specified cached volumes
          must be from the same gateway. Use  ListVolumes to get  volume  ARNs
          for a gateway.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       CachediSCSIVolumes -> (list)
          An array of objects where each object contains  metadata  about  one
          cached volume.

          (structure)
              Describes an iSCSI cached volume.

              VolumeARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage volume.

              VolumeId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the volume, e.g., vol-AE4B946D.

              VolumeType -> (string)
                 One  of  the VolumeType enumeration values that describes the
                 type of the volume.

              VolumeStatus -> (string)
                 One of the VolumeStatus values that indicates  the  state  of
                 the storage volume.

              VolumeAttachmentStatus -> (string)
                 A  value  that indicates whether a storage volume is attached
                 to or detached from a  gateway.  For  more  information,  see
                 Moving your volumes to a different gateway .

              VolumeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the volume capacity.

              VolumeProgress -> (double)
                 Represents the percentage complete if the volume is restoring
                 or bootstrapping that represents the percent of  data  trans-
                 ferred.  This  field  does  not appear in the response if the
                 cached volume is not restoring or bootstrapping.

              SourceSnapshotId -> (string)
                 If the cached volume was created from a snapshot, this  field
                 contains  the  snapshot  ID used, e.g., snap-78e22663. Other-
                 wise, this field is not included.

              VolumeiSCSIAttributes -> (structure)
                 An  VolumeiSCSIAttributes object that represents a collection
                 of iSCSI attributes for one stored volume.

                 TargetARN -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume target.

                 NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                     The network interface identifier.

                 NetworkInterfacePort -> (integer)
                     The port used to communicate with iSCSI targets.

                 LunNumber -> (integer)
                     The logical disk number.

                 ChapEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  mutual  CHAP is enabled for the iSCSI
                     target.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the volume was created.  Volumes  created  prior  to
                 March 28, 2017 dont have this timestamp.

              VolumeUsedInBytes -> (long)
                 The  size  of  the  data  stored on the volume in bytes. This
                 value is calculated based on the number of  blocks  that  are
                 touched,  instead  of the actual amount of data written. This
                 value can be useful for sequential write  patterns  but  less
                 accurate for random write patterns. VolumeUsedInBytes is dif-
                 ferent from the compressed size of the volume, which  is  the
                 value that is used to calculate your bill.

                 NOTE:
                     This  value is not available for volumes created prior to
                     May 13, 2015, until you store data on the volume.

                     If you use a delete tool that overwrites the data on your
                     volume  with random data, your usage will not be reduced.
                     This is because the random data is not  compressible.  If
                     you  want  to reduce the amount of billed storage on your
                     volume, we recommend overwriting your files with zeros to
                     compress  the data to a negligible amount of actual stor-
                     age.

              KMSKey -> (string)
                 Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric  cus-
                 tomer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryp-
                 tion. Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs.  This
                 value must be set if KMSEncrypted is true , or if Encryption-
                 Type is SseKms or DsseKms .

              TargetName -> (string)
                 The name of the iSCSI target used by an initiator to  connect
                 to  a volume and used as a suffix for the target ARN. For ex-
                 ample, specifying TargetName as myvolume results in the  tar-
                 get           ARN           of           arn:aws:storagegate-
                 way:us-east-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/tar-
                 get/iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume . The target name must be
                 unique across all volumes on a gateway.

                 If you don't specify a value, Storage Gateway uses the  value
                 that  was  previously  used for this volume as the new target
                 name.
