REFRESH-CACHE()                                                REFRESH-CACHE()



NAME
       refresh-cache -

DESCRIPTION
       Refreshes the cached inventory of objects for the specified file share.
       This operation finds objects in the Amazon S3 bucket that  were  added,
       removed,  or  replaced  since the gateway last listed the bucket's con-
       tents and cached the results. This operation does not import files into
       the S3 File Gateway cache storage. It only updates the cached inventory
       to reflect changes in the inventory of the objects in  the  S3  bucket.
       This operation is only supported in the S3 File Gateway types.

       You  can  subscribe  to  be notified through an Amazon CloudWatch event
       when your RefreshCache operation completes. For more  information,  see
       Getting  notified  about  file  operations  in the Storage Gateway User
       Guide . This operation is Only supported for S3 File Gateways.

       When this API is called, it only initiates the refresh operation.  When
       the API call completes and returns a success code, it doesn't necessar-
       ily mean that the file refresh has completed. You should  use  the  re-
       fresh-complete  notification  to  determine that the operation has com-
       pleted before you check for new files on the gateway  file  share.  You
       can  subscribe  to be notified through a CloudWatch event when your Re-
       freshCache operation completes.

       Throttle limit: This API is asynchronous, so the gateway will accept no
       more  than  two  refreshes  at  any  time.  We  recommend using the re-
       fresh-complete CloudWatch event notification before issuing  additional
       requests.  For more information, see Getting notified about file opera-
       tions in the Storage Gateway User Guide .

       WARNING:

          o Wait at least 60 seconds between consecutive RefreshCache API  re-
            quests.

          o RefreshCache does not evict cache entries if invoked consecutively
            within 60 seconds of a previous RefreshCache request.

          o If you invoke the RefreshCache API when two requests  are  already
            being  processed,  any new request will cause an InvalidGatewayRe-
            questException error because too many requests were  sent  to  the
            server.

       NOTE:
          The  S3  bucket  name does not need to be included when entering the
          list of folders in the FolderList parameter.

       For more information, see Getting notified about file operations in the
       Storage Gateway User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            refresh-cache
          --file-share-arn <value>
          [--folder-list <value>]
          [--recursive | --no-recursive]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-share-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the file share you want to re-
          fresh.

       --folder-list (list)
          A comma-separated list of the paths of folders  to  refresh  in  the
          cache.  The  default  is  ["/"  ]. The default refreshes objects and
          folders at the root of the Amazon S3 bucket. If Recursive is set  to
          true , the entire S3 bucket that the file share has access to is re-
          freshed.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --recursive | --no-recursive (boolean)
          A value that specifies whether to recursively refresh folders in the
          cache.  The refresh includes folders that were in the cache the last
          time the gateway listed the folder's contents. If this value set  to
          true  ,  each folder that is listed in FolderList is recursively up-
          dated. Otherwise, subfolders listed in FolderList are not refreshed.
          Only  objects  that  are in folders listed directly under FolderList
          are found and used for the update. The default is true .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To refresh the file share cache

       The  following refresh-cache example refreshes the cache for the speci-
       fied file share.

          aws storagegateway refresh-cache \
              --file-share-arn arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:111122223333:share/share-2FA12345

       Output:

          {
              "FileShareARN": "arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:111122223333:share/share-2FA12345",
              "NotificationId": "4954d4b1-abcd-ef01-1234-97950a7d3483"
          }

       For more information, see ListFileShares in  the  AWS  Storage  Gateway
       Service API Reference.

OUTPUT
       FileShareARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share.

       NotificationId -> (string)
          The randomly generated ID of the notification that was sent. This ID
          is in UUID format.
