DESCRIBE-TAPES()                                              DESCRIBE-TAPES()



NAME
       describe-tapes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  description  of the specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
       virtual tapes. If a TapeARN is not specified, returns a description  of
       all virtual tapes associated with the specified gateway. This operation
       is only supported in the tape gateway type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-tapes is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Tapes

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --tape-arns (list)
          Specifies  one or more unique Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that rep-
          resent the virtual tapes you want to describe. If this parameter  is
          not  specified,  Tape  gateway  returns a description of all virtual
          tapes associated with the specified gateway.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Tapes -> (list)
          An array of virtual tape descriptions.

          (structure)
              Describes a virtual tape object.

              TapeARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the virtual tape.

              TapeBarcode -> (string)
                 The barcode that identifies a specific virtual tape.

              TapeCreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the virtual tape was created.

              TapeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the virtual tape capacity.

              TapeStatus -> (string)
                 The current state of the virtual tape.

              VTLDevice -> (string)
                 The virtual tape library (VTL) device that the  virtual  tape
                 is associated with.

              Progress -> (double)
                 For  archiving virtual tapes, indicates how much data remains
                 to be uploaded before archiving is complete.

                 Range: 0 (not started) to 100 (complete).

              TapeUsedInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of data stored on the virtual tape.

                 NOTE:
                     This value is not available for tapes  created  prior  to
                     May 13, 2015.

              KMSKey -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master
                 key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption.  Storage
                 Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only
                 be set when KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

              PoolId -> (string)
                 The ID of the pool that contains tapes that will be archived.
                 The  tapes  in this pool are archived in the S3 storage class
                 that is associated with the pool. When you  use  your  backup
                 application  to eject the tape, the tape is archived directly
                 into the storage class (S3 Glacier or  S3  Glacier  Deep  Ar-
                 chive) that corresponds to the pool.

                 The date that the tape is first archived with tape  retention
                 lock enabled.

              PoolEntryDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the tape enters a custom tape pool.

       Marker -> (string)
          An  opaque  string  that can be used as part of a subsequent Descri-
          beTapes call to retrieve the next page of results.

          If a response does not contain a marker, then there are no more  re-
          sults to be retrieved.
