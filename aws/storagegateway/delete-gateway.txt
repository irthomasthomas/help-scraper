DELETE-GATEWAY()                                              DELETE-GATEWAY()



NAME
       delete-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  gateway. To specify which gateway to delete, use the Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN) of the  gateway  in  your  request.  The  operation
       deletes  the  gateway;  however, it does not delete the gateway virtual
       machine (VM) from your host computer.

       After you delete a gateway, you cannot reactivate it.  Completed  snap-
       shots of the gateway volumes are not deleted upon deleting the gateway,
       however, pending snapshots will not complete. After you delete a  gate-
       way, your next step is to remove it from your environment.

       WARNING:
          You  no  longer  pay  software charges after the gateway is deleted;
          however, your existing Amazon EBS snapshots  persist  and  you  will
          continue  to be billed for these snapshots. You can choose to remove
          all remaining Amazon EBS snapshots by canceling your Amazon EC2 sub-
          scription. If you prefer not to cancel your Amazon EC2 subscription,
          you can delete your snapshots using the Amazon EC2 console. For more
          information, see the Storage Gateway detail page .

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.
