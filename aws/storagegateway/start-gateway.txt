START-GATEWAY()                                                START-GATEWAY()



NAME
       start-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts a gateway that you previously shut down (see  ShutdownGateway ).
       After the gateway starts, you can then make other API calls,  your  ap-
       plications  can read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes and
       you will be able to take snapshot backups.

       NOTE:
          When you make a request, you will get a 200 OK success response  im-
          mediately.  However,  it  might take some time for the gateway to be
          ready. You should call   DescribeGatewayInformation  and  check  the
          status before making any additional API calls. For more information,
          see  ActivateGateway .

       To specify which gateway to start, use the Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)
       of the gateway in your request.

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.
