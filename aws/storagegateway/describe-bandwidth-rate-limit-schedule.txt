NAME
       describe-bandwidth-rate-limit-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about the bandwidth rate limit schedule of a gate-
       way. By default, gateways do not have bandwidth rate  limit  schedules,
       which  means no bandwidth rate limiting is in effect. This operation is
       supported only for volume, tape and S3 file gateways. FSx file gateways
       do not support bandwidth rate limits.

       This  operation  returns  information  about a gateway's bandwidth rate
       limit schedule. A bandwidth rate limit schedule consists of one or more
       bandwidth rate limit intervals. A bandwidth rate limit interval defines
       a period of time on one or more days of the week,  during  which  band-
       width rate limits are specified for uploading, downloading, or both.

       A  bandwidth  rate  limit  interval consists of one or more days of the
       week, a start hour and minute, an ending hour and minute, and bandwidth
       rate limits for uploading and downloading

       If  no bandwidth rate limit schedule intervals are set for the gateway,
       this operation returns an empty response. To specify which  gateway  to
       describe, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your re-
       quest.

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       BandwidthRateLimitIntervals -> (list)
          An array that contains the bandwidth rate limit intervals for a tape
          or volume gateway.

          (structure)
              Describes a bandwidth rate limit interval for a gateway. A band-
              width rate limit schedule consists of one or more bandwidth rate
              limit intervals. A bandwidth rate limit interval defines  a  pe-
              riod of time on one or more days of the week, during which band-
              width rate limits are specified for uploading,  downloading,  or
              both.

              StartHourOfDay -> (integer)
                 The  hour of the day to start the bandwidth rate limit inter-
                 val.

              StartMinuteOfHour -> (integer)
                 The minute of the hour to start the bandwidth rate limit  in-
                 terval.  The  interval begins at the start of that minute. To
                 begin an interval exactly at the start of the hour,  use  the
                 value 0 .

              EndHourOfDay -> (integer)
                 The hour of the day to end the bandwidth rate limit interval.

              EndMinuteOfHour -> (integer)
                 The minute of the hour to end the bandwidth rate limit inter-
                 val.

                 WARNING:
                     The bandwidth rate limit interval ends at the end of  the
                     minute. To end an interval at the end of an hour, use the
                     value 59 .

              DaysOfWeek -> (list)
                 The days of the week component of the  bandwidth  rate  limit
                 interval, represented as ordinal numbers from 0 to 6, where 0
                 represents Sunday and 6 represents Saturday.

                 (integer)

              AverageUploadRateLimitInBitsPerSec -> (long)
                 The average upload rate limit component of the bandwidth rate
                 limit  interval,  in bits per second. This field does not ap-
                 pear in the response if the upload rate limit is not set.

                 NOTE:
                     For Tape Gateway and Volume Gateway, the minimum value is
                     51200 .

                     For  S3  File  Gateway  and FSx File Gateway, the minimum
                     value is 104857600 .

              AverageDownloadRateLimitInBitsPerSec -> (long)
                 The average download rate limit component  of  the  bandwidth
                 rate  limit interval, in bits per second. This field does not
                 appear in the response if the download rate limit is not set.
