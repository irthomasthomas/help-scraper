NAME
       describe-stored-iscsi-volumes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  description  of  the gateway volumes specified in the re-
       quest. The list of gateway volumes in the  request  must  be  from  one
       gateway.  In  the  response, Storage Gateway returns volume information
       sorted by volume ARNs. This operation is only supported in stored  vol-
       ume gateway type.

OPTIONS
       --volume-arns (list)
          An array of strings where each string represents the Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN) of a stored volume. All of the specified  stored  volumes
          must  be  from the same gateway. Use  ListVolumes to get volume ARNs
          for a gateway.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 to, detached from, or is in the process of detaching  from  a
                 gateway.  For  more information, see Moving your volumes to a
                 different gateway .

              VolumeProgress -> (double)
                 Represents the percentage complete if the volume is restoring
                 or  bootstrapping  that represents the percent of data trans-
                 ferred. This field does not appear in  the  response  if  the
                 stored volume is not restoring or bootstrapping.

              VolumeDiskId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the local disk that was specified in the  Create-
                 StorediSCSIVolume operation.

              SourceSnapshotId -> (string)
                 If the stored volume was created from a snapshot, this  field
                 contains the snapshot ID used, e.g. snap-78e22663. Otherwise,
                 this field is not included.

              PreservedExistingData -> (boolean)
                 Indicates if when the stored  volume  was  created,  existing
                 data on the underlying local disk was preserved.

                 Valid Values: true | false

              VolumeiSCSIAttributes -> (structure)
                 An  VolumeiSCSIAttributes object that represents a collection
                 of iSCSI attributes for one stored volume.

                 TargetARN -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume target.

                 NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                     The network interface identifier.

                 NetworkInterfacePort -> (integer)
                     The port used to communicate with iSCSI targets.

                 LunNumber -> (integer)
                     The logical disk number.

                 ChapEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether mutual CHAP is enabled  for  the  iSCSI
                     target.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  the  volume  was created. Volumes created prior to
                 March 28, 2017 dont have this timestamp.

              VolumeUsedInBytes -> (long)
                 The size of the data stored on  the  volume  in  bytes.  This
                 value  is  calculated  based on the number of blocks that are
                 touched, instead of the actual amount of data  written.  This
                 value  can  be  useful for sequential write patterns but less
                 accurate for random write patterns. VolumeUsedInBytes is dif-
                 ferent  from  the compressed size of the volume, which is the
                 value that is used to calculate your bill.

                 NOTE:
                     This value is not available for volumes created prior  to
                     May 13, 2015, until you store data on the volume.

              KMSKey -> (string)
                 Optional.  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric cus-
                 tomer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryp-
                 tion.  Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This
                 value must be set if KMSEncrypted is true , or if Encryption-
                 Type is SseKms or DsseKms .

              TargetName -> (string)
                 The  name of the iSCSI target used by an initiator to connect
                 to a volume and used as a suffix for the target ARN. For  ex-
                 ample,  specifying TargetName as myvolume results in the tar-
                 get           ARN           of           arn:aws:storagegate-
                 way:us-east-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/tar-
                 get/iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume . The target name must be
                 unique across all volumes on a gateway.

                 If  you don't specify a value, Storage Gateway uses the value
                 that was previously used for this volume as  the  new  target
                 name.
