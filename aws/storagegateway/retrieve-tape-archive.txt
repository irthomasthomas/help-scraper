RETRIEVE-TAPE-ARCHIVE()                                RETRIEVE-TAPE-ARCHIVE()



NAME
       retrieve-tape-archive -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves an archived virtual tape from the virtual tape shelf (VTS) to
       a tape gateway. Virtual tapes archived in the VTS  are  not  associated
       with  any  gateway. However after a tape is retrieved, it is associated
       with a gateway, even though it is also listed in the VTS, that is,  ar-
       chive. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.

       Once  a  tape  is successfully retrieved to a gateway, it cannot be re-
       trieved again to another gateway. You must archive the tape  again  be-
       fore  you  can  retrieve  it to another gateway. This operation is only
       supported in the tape gateway type.

OPTIONS
       --tape-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the virtual tape you want  to  re-
          trieve from the virtual tape shelf (VTS).

       --gateway-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway you want to retrieve
          the virtual tape to. Use the  ListGateways  operation  to  return  a
          list of gateways for your account and Amazon Web Services Region.

          You  retrieve  archived  virtual  tapes  to only one gateway and the
          gateway must be a tape gateway.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
