LIST-VOLUME-RECOVERY-POINTS()                    LIST-VOLUME-RECOVERY-POINTS()



NAME
       list-volume-recovery-points -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  recovery  points for a specified gateway. This operation is
       only supported in the cached volume gateway type.

       Each cache volume has one recovery point. A volume recovery point is  a
       point  in  time  at which all data of the volume is consistent and from
       which you can create a snapshot or clone a new  cached  volume  from  a
       source  volume.  To  create a snapshot from a volume recovery point use
       the  CreateSnapshotFromVolumeRecoveryPoint operation.

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       VolumeRecoveryPointInfos -> (list)
          An array of  VolumeRecoveryPointInfo objects.

          (structure)
              Describes a storage volume recovery point object.

              VolumeARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume target.

              VolumeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size of the volume in bytes.

              VolumeUsageInBytes -> (long)
                 The size of the data stored on the volume in bytes.

                 NOTE:
                     This  value is not available for volumes created prior to
                     May 13, 2015, until you store data on the volume.

              VolumeRecoveryPointTime -> (string)
                 The time the recovery point was taken.
