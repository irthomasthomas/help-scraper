UPDATE-SMB-FILE-SHARE()                                UPDATE-SMB-FILE-SHARE()



NAME
       update-smb-file-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a Server Message Block (SMB) file share. This operation is only
       supported for S3 File Gateways.

       NOTE:
          To leave a file share field unchanged, set the  corresponding  input
          field to null.

       WARNING:
          File  gateways  require  Security Token Service (Amazon Web Services
          STS) to be activated to enable you to create a file share. Make sure
          that Amazon Web Services STS is activated in the Amazon Web Services
          Region you are creating your file gateway in. If Amazon Web Services
          STS  is  not  activated in this Amazon Web Services Region, activate
          it. For information about how to activate Amazon Web  Services  STS,
          see Activating and deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon
          Web Services Region in the Identity and Access Management User Guide
          .

          File  gateways  don't  support  creating hard or symbolic links on a
          file share.

OPTIONS
       --file-share-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SMB file share that  you  want
          to update.

       --encryption-type (string)
          A  value  that specifies the type of server-side encryption that the
          file share will use for the data that it stores in Amazon S3.

          NOTE:
              We recommend using EncryptionType instead of KMSEncrypted to set
              the  file  share  encryption  method. You do not need to provide
              values for both parameters.

              If values for both parameters exist in the  same  request,  then
              the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example,
              if EncryptionType is SseS3 , then KMSEncrypted must be  false  .
              If  EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms , then KMSEncrypted must
              be true .

          Possible values:

          o SseS3

          o SseKms

          o DsseKms

       --kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted (boolean)
          Optional. Set to true to use Amazon S3 server-side  encryption  with
          your  own KMS key (SSE-KMS), or false to use a key managed by Amazon
          S3 (SSE-S3). To use dual-layer encryption (DSSE-KMS),  set  the  En-
          cryptionType parameter instead.

          NOTE:
              We recommend using EncryptionType instead of KMSEncrypted to set
              the file share encryption method. You do  not  need  to  provide
              values for both parameters.

              If  values  for  both parameters exist in the same request, then
              the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example,
              if  EncryptionType  is SseS3 , then KMSEncrypted must be false .
              If EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms , then KMSEncrypted  must
              be true .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --kms-key (string)
          Optional.  The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer
          master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption.  Storage
          Gateway  does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value must be set if
          KMSEncrypted is true , or if EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms .

       --default-storage-class (string)
          The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon  S3  bucket
          by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is S3_STANDARD . Optional.

          Valid  Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING | S3_STANDARD_IA
          | S3_ONEZONE_IA

       --object-acl (string)
          A value that sets the access control list (ACL) permission  for  ob-
          jects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into. The
          default value is private .

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public-read

          o public-read-write

          o authenticated-read

          o bucket-owner-read

          o bucket-owner-full-control

          o aws-exec-read

       --read-only | --no-read-only (boolean)
          A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set  this  value
          to true to set write status to read-only, otherwise set to false .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --guess-mime-type-enabled | --no-guess-mime-type-enabled (boolean)
          A  value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects
          based on file extensions. Set this value to true to enable MIME type
          guessing, otherwise set to false . The default value is true .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --requester-pays | --no-requester-pays (boolean)
          A  value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost as-
          sociated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set
          to  true  ,  the  requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket
          owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always  pays  the  cost  of
          storing data.

          NOTE:
              RequesterPays  is  a  configuration for the S3 bucket that backs
              the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the  file
              share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --smbacl-enabled | --no-smbacl-enabled (boolean)
          Set  this  value  to true to enable access control list (ACL) on the
          SMB file share. Set it to false to map file  and  directory  permis-
          sions to the POSIX permissions.

          For more information, see Using Windows ACLs to limit SMB file share
          access in the Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --access-based-enumeration | --no-access-based-enumeration (boolean)
          The files and folders on this share will only be  visible  to  users
          with read access.

       --admin-user-list (list)
          A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that have adminis-
          trator rights to the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @
          character.  Acceptable  formats  include:  DOMAIN\User1  ,  user1  ,
          @group1 , and @DOMAIN\group1 . Can only be set if Authentication  is
          set to ActiveDirectory .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --valid-user-list (list)
          A  list  of users or groups in the Active Directory that are allowed
          to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @  char-
          acter.  Acceptable formats include: DOMAIN\User1 , user1 , @group1 ,
          and @DOMAIN\group1 . Can only be set if Authentication is set to Ac-
          tiveDirectory .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --invalid-user-list (list)
          A  list  of users or groups in the Active Directory that are not al-
          lowed to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the  @
          character.  Acceptable  formats  include:  DOMAIN\User1  ,  user1  ,
          @group1 , and @DOMAIN\group1 . Can only be set if Authentication  is
          set to ActiveDirectory .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --audit-destination-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit logs.

       --case-sensitivity (string)
          The  case of an object name in an Amazon S3 bucket. For ClientSpeci-
          fied , the client determines the case sensitivity. For CaseSensitive
          ,  the gateway determines the case sensitivity. The default value is
          ClientSpecified .

          Possible values:

          o ClientSpecified

          o CaseSensitive

       --file-share-name (string)
          The name of the file share. Optional.

          NOTE:
              FileShareName must be set if an S3 prefix name is set  in  Loca-
              tionARN , or if an access point or access point alias is used.

       --cache-attributes (structure)
          Specifies refresh cache information for the file share.

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              Refreshes  a file share's cache by using Time To Live (TTL). TTL
              is the length of time since the last refresh after which  access
              to  the  directory would cause the file gateway to first refresh
              that directory's contents from the Amazon S3  bucket  or  Amazon
              FSx file system. The TTL duration is in seconds.

              Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30 days)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds": integer
          }

       --notification-policy (string)
          The  notification  policy  of  the file share. SettlingTimeInSeconds
          controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in  time
          a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notifi-
          cation. Because clients can make many small writes  to  files,  it's
          best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generat-
          ing multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

          NOTE:
                 SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the  ob-
                 ject uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notifica-
                 tion.

              This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which  the
              notification  will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might re-
              quire more than the specified delay time to  generate  and  send
              notifications.

          The  following  example  sets  NotificationPolicy  on with Settling-
          TimeInSeconds set to 60.
              {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}

          The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.
              {}

       --oplocks-enabled | --no-oplocks-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB  file
          share.

          NOTE:
              Enabling  opportunistic  locking on case-sensitive shares is not
              recommended for workloads that involve access to files with  the
              same name in different case.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
