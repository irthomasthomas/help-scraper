LIST-LOCAL-DISKS()                                          LIST-LOCAL-DISKS()



NAME
       list-local-disks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the gateway's local disks. To specify which gateway
       to describe, you use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  gateway  in
       the body of the request.

       The  request  returns a list of all disks, specifying which are config-
       ured as working storage, cache storage, or stored volume or not config-
       ured  at  all. The response includes a DiskStatus field. This field can
       have a value of present (the disk is available to  use),  missing  (the
       disk is no longer connected to the gateway), or mismatch (the disk node
       is occupied by a disk that has incorrect metadata or the  disk  content
       is corrupted).

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways

          Web Services Region.

       Disks -> (list)

                 The  unique device ID or other distinguishing data that iden-
                 tifies a local disk.

                 The path of a local disk in the gateway virtual machine (VM).

              DiskNode -> (string)
                 The device node of a local disk as assigned by  the  virtual-
                 ization environment.

              DiskStatus -> (string)
                 A value that represents the status of a local disk.

              DiskSizeInBytes -> (long)

              DiskAllocationType -> (string)
                 One of the DiskAllocationType enumeration values that identi-
                 fies how a local disk is used.

                 Valid Values: UPLOAD_BUFFER | CACHE_STORAGE

              DiskAllocationResource -> (string)

                 This  field is not included in the response if the local disk
                 is not defined as an iSCSI target. The format of  this  field
