OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways

          A set of variables indicating the software  update  preferences  for
          the gateway.

          Includes AutomaticUpdatePolicy parameter with the following inputs:
              ALL_VERSIONS - Enables regular gateway maintenance updates.

              EMERGENCY_VERSIONS_ONLY  -  Disables regular gateway maintenance
              updates. The gateway will still receive  emergency  version  up-
              dates  on  rare occasions if necessary to remedy highly critical
              security or durability issues. You will be  notified  before  an
              emergency  version  update is applied. These updates are applied
              during your gateway's scheduled maintenance window.

          AutomaticUpdatePolicy -> (string)
              Indicates the automatic update policy for a gateway.
                 ALL_VERSIONS - Enables regular gateway maintenance updates.

                 EMERGENCY_VERSIONS_ONLY - Disables  regular  gateway  mainte-
                 nance  updates. The gateway will still receive emergency ver-
                 sion updates on rare occasions if necessary to remedy  highly
                 critical  security or durability issues. You will be notified
                 before an emergency version update is applied. These  updates
                 are  applied during your gateway's scheduled maintenance win-
