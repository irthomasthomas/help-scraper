DESCRIBE-WORKING-STORAGE()                          DESCRIBE-WORKING-STORAGE()



NAME
       describe-working-storage -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the working storage of a gateway. This opera-
       tion is only supported in the stored volumes gateway type. This  opera-
       tion  is  deprecated  in cached volumes API version (20120630). Use De-
       scribeUploadBuffer instead.

       NOTE:
          Working storage is also referred to as upload buffer. You  can  also
          use  the  DescribeUploadBuffer  operation  to add upload buffer to a
          stored volume gateway.

       The response includes disk IDs that are configured as working  storage,
       and it includes the amount of working storage allocated and used.

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       DiskIds -> (list)
          An array of the gateway's local disk  IDs  that  are  configured  as
          working  storage. Each local disk ID is specified as a string (mini-
          mum length of 1 and maximum length of 300). If no  local  disks  are
          configured as working storage, then the DiskIds array is empty.

          (string)

       WorkingStorageUsedInBytes -> (long)
          The  total  working  storage  in  bytes in use by the gateway. If no
          working storage is configured for the gateway, this field returns 0.

       WorkingStorageAllocatedInBytes -> (long)
          The total working storage in bytes allocated for the gateway. If  no
          working storage is configured for the gateway, this field returns 0.
