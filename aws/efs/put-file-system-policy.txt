PUT-FILE-SYSTEM-POLICY()                              PUT-FILE-SYSTEM-POLICY()



NAME
       put-file-system-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  an Amazon EFS FileSystemPolicy to an Amazon EFS file system. A
       file system policy is an IAM resource-based policy and can contain mul-
       tiple policy statements. A file system always has exactly one file sys-
       tem policy, which can be the default policy or an explicit  policy  set
       or  updated  using  this API operation. EFS file system policies have a
       20,000 character limit. When an explicit policy is  set,  it  overrides
       the  default policy. For more information about the default file system
       policy, see Default EFS File System Policy .

       NOTE:
          EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character limit.

       This operation  requires  permissions  for  the  elasticfilesystem:Put-
       FileSystemPolicy action.

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The  ID of the EFS file system that you want to create or update the
          FileSystemPolicy for.

       --policy (string)
          The FileSystemPolicy that you're creating. Accepts a JSON  formatted
          policy  definition. EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character
          limit. To find out more about the elements that make up a file  sys-
          tem policy, see EFS Resource-based Policies .

       --bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check     |     --no-bypass-policy-lock-
       out-safety-check (boolean)
          (Optional) A boolean that specifies whether or  not  to  bypass  the
          FileSystemPolicy  lockout safety check. The lockout safety check de-
          termines whether the policy in the request will lock  out,  or  pre-
          vent,  the  IAM principal that is making the request from making fu-
          ture PutFileSystemPolicy requests  on  this  file  system.  Set  By-
          passPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to True only when you intend to prevent
          the IAM principal that is making the request from making  subsequent
          PutFileSystemPolicy  requests on this file system. The default value
          is False .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FileSystemId -> (string)
          Specifies the EFS file system to which the FileSystemPolicy applies.

       Policy -> (string)
          The JSON formatted FileSystemPolicy for the EFS file system.
