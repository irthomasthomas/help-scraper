NAME
       create-replication-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a replication conguration to either a new or existing EFS file
       system. For more information, see Amazon EFS replication in the  Amazon
       EFS User Guide . The replication configuration specifies the following:

       o Source file system  The EFS file system that you want to replicate.

       o Destination  file  system   The  destination file system to which the
         source file system is replicated. There can only be  one  destination
         file system in a replication configuration.

       NOTE:
              A file system can be part of only one replication configuration.

          The  destination parameters for the replication configuration depend
          on whether you are replicating to a new file system or to an  exist-
          ing  file  system, and if you are replicating across Amazon Web Ser-
          vices accounts. See  DestinationToCreate for more information.

       This operation  requires  permissions  for  the  elasticfilesystem:Cre-
       ateReplicationConfiguration action. Additionally, other permissions are
       required depending on how you are replicating file  systems.  For  more
       information, see Required permissions for replication in the Amazon EFS
       User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --source-file-system-id (string)
          Specifies the Amazon EFS file system that  you  want  to  replicate.
          This file system cannot already be a source or destination file sys-
          tem in another replication configuration.

       --destinations (list)
          An array of destination configuration objects. Only one  destination
          configuration object is supported.

          (structure)
              Describes  the  new  or existing destination file system for the
              replication configuration.

              o If you want to replicate to a new file system, do not  specify
                the File System ID for the destination file system. Amazon EFS
                creates a new, empty file system. For One Zone storage,  spec-
                ify the Availability Zone to create the file system in. To use
                an Key Management Service key other than the default KMS  key,
                then  specify it. For more information, see Configuring repli-
                cation to new Amazon EFS file system in the  Amazon  EFS  User
                Guide .

              NOTE:
                 After  the  file system is created, you cannot change the KMS
                 key or the performance mode.

              o If you want to replicate to an existing file system that's  in
                the  same  account as the source file system, then you need to
                provide the ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file  sys-
                tem to which to replicate. The file system's replication over-
                write protection must be disabled. For more  information,  see
                Replicating  to an existing file system in the Amazon EFS User
                Guide .

              o If you are replicating the file system to a file system that's
                in  a different account than the source file system (cross-ac-
                count replication), you need to provide the ARN for  the  file
                system  and  the  IAM  role  that allows Amazon EFS to perform
                replication on the  destination  account.  The  file  system's
                replication  overwrite  protection  must be disabled. For more
                information, see Replicating across Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
                counts in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

              Region -> (string)
                 To  create  a file system that uses Regional storage, specify
                 the Amazon Web Services Region in which to create the  desti-
                 nation file system. The Region must be enabled for the Amazon
                 Web Services account that owns the source  file  system.  For
                 more information, see Managing Amazon Web Services Regions in
                 the Amazon Web Services General Reference Reference Guide .

              AvailabilityZoneName -> (string)
                 To create a file system that uses One Zone  storage,  specify
                 the name of the Availability Zone in which to create the des-
                 tination file system.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Specify the Key Management Service (KMS) key that you want to
                 use  to  encrypt  the  destination file system. If you do not
                 specify a KMS key, Amazon EFS uses your default KMS  key  for
                 Amazon EFS, /aws/elasticfilesystem . This ID can be in one of
                 the following formats:

                 o Key ID - The unique identifier  of  the  key,  for  example
                   1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab .

                 o ARN    -    The    ARN    for    the   key,   for   example
                   arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
                   .

                 o Key  alias  -  A previously created display name for a key,
                   for example alias/projectKey1 .

                 o Key alias ARN - The  ARN  for  a  key  alias,  for  example
                   arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1 .

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The  ID or ARN of the file system to use for the destination.
                 For cross-account replication, this must be an ARN. The  file
                 system's  replication overwrite replication must be disabled.
                 If no ID or ARN is specified, then a new file system is  cre-
                 ated.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role in the source ac-
                 count that allows Amazon EFS to perform  replication  on  its
                 behalf. This is optional for same-account replication and re-
                 quired for cross-account replication.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Region=string,AvailabilityZoneName=string,KmsKeyId=string,FileSystemId=string,RoleArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Region": "string",
              "AvailabilityZoneName": "string",
              "KmsKeyId": "string",
              "FileSystemId": "string",
              "RoleArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
