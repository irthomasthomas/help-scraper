OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the file system that you want to update.

       --throughput-mode (string)
          (Optional) Updates the file system's throughput mode. If you're  not
          updating  your throughput mode, you don't need to provide this value
          in your request. If you are changing the  ThroughputMode  to  provi-
          sioned  , you must also set a value for ProvisionedThroughputInMibps
          .

          Possible values:

          o bursting

          o provisioned

          o elastic

       --provisioned-throughput-in-mibps (double)
          (Optional) Sets the amount of provisioned throughput, in MiB/s,  for
          the  file  system.  Valid values are 1-1024. If you are changing the
          throughput mode to provisioned, you must also provide the amount  of
          provisioned  throughput.  Required  if  ThroughputMode is changed to
          provisioned on update.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       OwnerId -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account that created the file system.

       CreationToken -> (string)
          The opaque string specified in the request.

       FileSystemId -> (string)
          The ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

       FileSystemArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the EFS file system, in the for-
          mat  arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:*region*   :*account-id*   :file-sys-
          tem/*file-system-id*  `` . Example with sample data: ``arn:aws:elas-
          ticfilesystem:us-west-2:1111333322228888:file-system/fs-01234567

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that  the  file  system  was  created,  in  seconds  (since
          1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

       LifeCycleState -> (string)
          The lifecycle phase of the file system.

       Name -> (string)
          You  can  add  tags to a file system, including a Name tag. For more
          information, see  CreateFileSystem . If the file system has  a  Name
          tag, Amazon EFS returns the value in this field.

       NumberOfMountTargets -> (integer)
          The  current  number  of mount targets that the file system has. For
          more information, see  CreateMountTarget .

       SizeInBytes -> (structure)
          The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the  file
          system,  in its Value field, and the time at which that size was de-
          termined in its Timestamp field. The Timestamp value is the  integer
          number  of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The SizeInBytes value
          doesn't represent the size of a consistent snapshot of the file sys-
          tem, but it is eventually consistent when there are no writes to the
          file system. That is, SizeInBytes represents actual size only if the
          file  system  is  not  modified for a period longer than a couple of
          hours. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size that the file sys-
          tem was at any point in time.

          Value -> (long)
              The  latest  known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the
              file system.

          Timestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the size of data, returned in the Value field,
              was determined. The value is the integer number of seconds since
              1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

          ValueInIA -> (long)
              The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored  in  the
              Infrequent Access storage class.

          ValueInStandard -> (long)
              The  latest  known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the
              Standard storage class.

       PerformanceMode -> (string)
          The performance mode of the file system.

       Encrypted -> (boolean)
          A Boolean value that, if true, indicates that the file system is en-
          crypted.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The ID of an KMS key used to protect the encrypted file system.

       ThroughputMode -> (string)
          Displays  the  file  system's throughput mode. For more information,
          see Throughput modes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

       ProvisionedThroughputInMibps -> (double)
          The amount of provisioned throughput, measured  in  MiB/s,  for  the
          file system. Valid for file systems using ThroughputMode set to pro-
          visioned .

       AvailabilityZoneName -> (string)
          Describes the Amazon Web Services Availability  Zone  in  which  the
          file system is located, and is valid only for file systems using One
          Zone storage classes. For more information, see  Using  EFS  storage
          classes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

       AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
          The  unique  and  consistent  identifier of the Availability Zone in
          which the file system's One Zone storage classes exist. For example,
          use1-az1  is  an  Availability  Zone ID for the us-east-1 Amazon Web
          Services Region, and it has the same location in  every  Amazon  Web
          Services account.

       Tags -> (list)
          The  tags  associated with the file system, presented as an array of
          Tag objects.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed characters are letters, white
              space,  and  numbers  that  can be represented in UTF-8, and the
              following characters:+ - = . _ : / .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key (String). The key can't start with aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag key.
