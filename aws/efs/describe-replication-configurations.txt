       a file system is not specified, all of the  replication  configurations
       for  the  Amazon  Web Services account in an Amazon Web Services Region
       are retrieved.

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          You can retrieve the replication configuration for a  specific  file
          system by providing its file system ID.

       --next-token (string)
          NextToken is present if the response is paginated. You can use Next-
          Token in a subsequent request to fetch the next page of output.

       --max-results (integer)
          (Optional) To limit the number of objects returned  in  a  response,
          you can specify the MaxItems parameter. The default value is 100.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Replications -> (list)
          The collection of replication configurations that is returned.

          (structure)
              SourceFileSystemId -> (string)
                 The ID of the source Amazon EFS file  system  that  is  being
                 replicated.

              SourceFileSystemRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region in which the source Amazon EFS
                 file system is located.

              SourceFileSystemArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  current  source  file
                 system in the replication configuration.

              OriginalSourceFileSystemArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the original source Amazon
                 EFS file system in the replication configuration.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Describes when the replication configuration was created.

              Destinations -> (list)
                 An array of destination objects. Only one destination  object
                 is supported.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the destination file system in the replication
                     configuration.

                     Status -> (string)
                        Describes the status of  the  destination  Amazon  EFS
                        file system.

                        o The Paused state occurs as a result of opting out of
                          the source or destination Region after the  replica-
                          tion  configuration  was created. To resume replica-
                          tion for the file system, you need to again  opt  in
                          to the Amazon Web Services Region. For more informa-
                          tion, see Managing Amazon Web  Services  Regions  in
                          the Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide .

                        o The Error state occurs when either the source or the
                          destination file system (or both)  is  in  a  failed
                          state  and  is  unrecoverable. For more information,
                          see Monitoring replication status in the Amazon  EFS
                          User Guide . You must delete the replication config-
                          uration, and then restore the most recent backup  of
                          the  failed  file  system  (either the source or the
                          destination) to a new file system.

                     FileSystemId -> (string)
                        The ID of the destination Amazon EFS file system.

                     Region -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Region in which  the  destina-
                        tion file system is located.

                     LastReplicatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                        The  time  when  the most recent sync was successfully
                        completed on the destination file system. Any  changes
                        to data on the source file system that occurred before
                        this time have been  successfully  replicated  to  the
                        destination file system. Any changes that occurred af-
                        ter this time might not be fully replicated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          You can use the NextToken from the previous response in a subsequent
          request to fetch the additional descriptions.
