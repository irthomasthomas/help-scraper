NAME
       describe-replication-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the replication configuration for a specific file system. If
       a file system is not specified, all of the  replication  configurations
       for  the  Amazon  Web Services account in an Amazon Web Services Region
       are retrieved.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replication-configurations
          [--file-system-id <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          You can retrieve the replication configuration for a  specific  file
          system by providing its file system ID.

       --next-token (string)
          NextToken is present if the response is paginated. You can use Next-
          Token in a subsequent request to fetch the next page of output.

       --max-results (integer)
          (Optional) To limit the number of objects returned  in  a  response,
          you can specify the MaxItems parameter. The default value is 100.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Replications -> (list)
          The collection of replication configurations that is returned.

          (structure)
              SourceFileSystemId -> (string)
                 The ID of the source Amazon EFS file  system  that  is  being
                 replicated.

              SourceFileSystemRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region in which the source Amazon EFS
                 file system is located.

              SourceFileSystemArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  current  source  file
                 system in the replication configuration.

              OriginalSourceFileSystemArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the original source Amazon
                 EFS file system in the replication configuration.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Describes when the replication configuration was created.

              Destinations -> (list)
                 An array of destination objects. Only one destination  object
                 is supported.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the destination file system in the replication
                     configuration.

                     Status -> (string)
                        Describes the status of  the  destination  Amazon  EFS
                        file  system. If the status is ERROR , the destination
                        file system in the replication configuration is  in  a
                        failed  state and is unrecoverable. To access the file
                        system data, restore a backup of the failed file  sys-
                        tem to a new file system.

                     FileSystemId -> (string)
                        The ID of the destination Amazon EFS file system.

                     Region -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Web Services Region in which the destina-
                        tion file system is located.

                     LastReplicatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                        The time when the most recent  sync  was  successfully
                        completed  on the destination file system. Any changes
                        to data on the source file system that occurred before
                        this  time  have  been  successfully replicated to the
                        destination file system. Any changes that occurred af-
                        ter this time might not be fully replicated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          You can use the NextToken from the previous response in a subsequent
          request to fetch the additional descriptions.
