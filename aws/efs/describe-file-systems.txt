DESCRIBE-FILE-SYSTEMS()                                DESCRIBE-FILE-SYSTEMS()



NAME
       describe-file-systems -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the description of a specific Amazon EFS file system if either
       the file system CreationToken or the FileSystemId is  provided.  Other-
       wise, it returns descriptions of all file systems owned by the caller's
       Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services  Region  of  the
       endpoint that you're calling.

       When  retrieving all file system descriptions, you can optionally spec-
       ify the MaxItems parameter to limit the number of descriptions in a re-
       sponse.  This  number  is automatically set to 100. If more file system
       descriptions remain, Amazon EFS returns a NextMarker , an opaque token,
       in  the  response.  In  this case, you should send a subsequent request
       with the Marker request parameter set to the value of NextMarker .

       To retrieve a list of your file system descriptions, this operation  is
       used in an iterative process, where DescribeFileSystems is called first
       without the Marker and then the operation continues to call it with the
       Marker  parameter  set to the value of the NextMarker from the previous
       response until the response has no NextMarker .

       The order  of  file  systems  returned  in  the  response  of  one  De-
       scribeFileSystems  call  and  the order of file systems returned across
       the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  for  the  elasticfilesystem:De-
       scribeFileSystems action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-file-systems  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: FileSystems

OPTIONS
       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --creation-token (string)
          (Optional) Restricts the list to the file system with this  creation
          token (String). You specify a creation token when you create an Ama-
          zon EFS file system.

       --file-system-id (string)
          (Optional) ID of the file system whose description you want  to  re-
          trieve (String).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       FileSystems -> (list)
          An array of file system descriptions.

          (structure)
              A description of the file system.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account that created the file system.

              CreationToken -> (string)
                 The opaque string specified in the request.

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

              FileSystemArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for the EFS file system, in
                 the format  arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:*region*  :*account-id*
                 :file-system/*file-system-id*  `` . Example with sample data:
                 ``arn:aws:elasticfilesys-
                 tem:us-west-2:1111333322228888:file-system/fs-01234567

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time that the file system was created, in seconds (since
                 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

              LifeCycleState -> (string)
                 The lifecycle phase of the file system.

              Name -> (string)
                 You can add tags to a file system, including a Name tag.  For
                 more  information, see  CreateFileSystem . If the file system
                 has a Name tag, Amazon EFS returns the value in this field.

              NumberOfMountTargets -> (integer)
                 The current number of mount targets that the file system has.
                 For more information, see  CreateMountTarget .

              SizeInBytes -> (structure)
                 The  latest  known  metered size (in bytes) of data stored in
                 the file system, in its Value field, and the  time  at  which
                 that  size  was  determined in its Timestamp field. The Time-
                 stamp  value  is  the  integer  number   of   seconds   since
                 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The SizeInBytes value doesn't represent
                 the size of a consistent snapshot of the file system, but  it
                 is eventually consistent when there are no writes to the file
                 system. That is, SizeInBytes represents actual size  only  if
                 the  file  system  is not modified for a period longer than a
                 couple of hours. Otherwise, the value is not the  exact  size
                 that the file system was at any point in time.

                 Value -> (long)
                     The  latest  known metered size (in bytes) of data stored
                     in the file system.

                 Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The time at which the size of data, returned in the Value
                     field, was determined. The value is the integer number of
                     seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

                 ValueInIA -> (long)
                     The latest known metered size (in bytes) of  data  stored
                     in the Infrequent Access storage class.

                 ValueInStandard -> (long)
                     The  latest  known metered size (in bytes) of data stored
                     in the Standard storage class.

                 ValueInArchive -> (long)
                     The latest known metered size (in bytes) of  data  stored
                     in the Archive storage class.

              PerformanceMode -> (string)
                 The performance mode of the file system.

              Encrypted -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value that, if true, indicates that the file system
                 is encrypted.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of an KMS key used to protect the encrypted file  sys-
                 tem.

              ThroughputMode -> (string)
                 Displays the file system's throughput mode. For more informa-
                 tion, see Throughput modes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

              ProvisionedThroughputInMibps -> (double)
                 The amount of provisioned throughput, measured in MiBps,  for
                 the  file system. Valid for file systems using ThroughputMode
                 set to provisioned .

              AvailabilityZoneName -> (string)
                 Describes the Amazon Web Services Availability Zone in  which
                 the  file  system  is located, and is valid only for One Zone
                 file systems. For more information,  see  Using  EFS  storage
                 classes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

              AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
                 The unique and consistent identifier of the Availability Zone
                 in which the file system is located, and is  valid  only  for
                 One Zone file systems. For example, use1-az1 is an Availabil-
                 ity Zone ID for the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region, and
                 it  has  the  same  location in every Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags associated with the file system, presented as an ar-
                 ray of Tag objects.

                 (structure)
                     A  tag  is  a key-value pair. Allowed characters are let-
                     ters, white space, and numbers that can be represented in
                     UTF-8, and the following characters:+ - = . _ : / .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The tag key (String). The key can't start with aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag key.

              FileSystemProtection -> (structure)
                 Describes the protection on the file system.

                 ReplicationOverwriteProtection -> (string)
                     The  status  of  the  file system's replication overwrite
                     protection.

                     o ENABLED  The file system cannot be used as the destina-
                       tion  file  system  in a replication configuration. The
                       file system is writeable. Replication overwrite protec-
                       tion is ENABLED by default.

                     o DISABLED   The  file system can be used as the destina-
                       tion file system in a  replication  configuration.  The
                       file  system  is  read-only and can only be modified by
                       EFS replication.

                     o REPLICATING  The file system is being used as the  des-
                       tination  file  system  in a replication configuration.
                       The file system is read-only and is only modified  only
                       by EFS replication.

                     If  the  replication  configuration  is deleted, the file
                     system's replication overwrite protection is  re-enabled,
                     the file system becomes writeable.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          Present if there are more file systems than returned in the response
          (String). You can use the NextMarker in the  subsequent  request  to
          fetch the descriptions.
