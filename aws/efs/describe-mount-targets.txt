DESCRIBE-MOUNT-TARGETS()                              DESCRIBE-MOUNT-TARGETS()



NAME
       describe-mount-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  descriptions  of all the current mount targets, or a spe-
       cific mount target, for a file system. When requesting all of the  cur-
       rent mount targets, the order of mount targets returned in the response
       is unspecified.

       This operation requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:Describe-
       MountTargets  action,  on either the file system ID that you specify in
       FileSystemId , or on the file system of the mount target that you spec-
       ify in MountTargetId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-mount-targets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: MountTargets

OPTIONS
       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --file-system-id (string)
          (Optional) ID of the file system whose mount  targets  you  want  to
          list  (String).  It  must  be included in your request if an Access-
          PointId or MountTargetId is not included. Accepts either a file sys-
          tem ID or ARN as input.

       --mount-target-id (string)
          (Optional)  ID  of  the mount target that you want to have described
          (String). It must be included in your request if FileSystemId is not
          included. Accepts either a mount target ID or ARN as input.

       --access-point-id (string)
          (Optional)  The  ID of the access point whose mount targets that you
          want to list. It must be included in your request if a  FileSystemId
          or  MountTargetId is not included in your request. Accepts either an
          access point ID or ARN as input.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       File System User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          If the request included the Marker , the response returns that value
          in this field.

       MountTargets -> (list)
          Returns the file system's mount targets as an array of  MountTarget-
          Description objects.

          (structure)
              Provides a description of a mount target.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 Amazon Web Services account ID that owns the resource.

              MountTargetId -> (string)
                 System-assigned mount target ID.

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the file system for which the mount target is in-
                 tended.

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the mount target's subnet.

              LifeCycleState -> (string)
                 Lifecycle state of the mount target.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 Address at which the file system can be mounted by using  the
                 mount target.

              NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the network interface that Amazon EFS created when
                 it created the mount target.

              AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
                 The unique and consistent identifier of the Availability Zone
                 that the mount target resides in. For example, use1-az1 is an
                 AZ ID for the us-east-1 Region and it has the  same  location

                 The  name  of the Availability Zone in which the mount target
                 is located. Availability Zones are  independently  mapped  to
                 names  for each Amazon Web Services account. For example, the
                 Availability Zone us-east-1a for your Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count  might  not  be the same location as us-east-1a for an-
                 other Amazon Web Services account.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The virtual private cloud (VPC) ID that the mount  target  is
                 configured in.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If  a value is present, there are more mount targets to return. In a
          subsequent request, you can provide Marker in your request with this
          value to retrieve the next set of mount targets.
