DESCRIBE-ACCESS-POINTS()                              DESCRIBE-ACCESS-POINTS()



NAME
       describe-access-points -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  description  of a specific Amazon EFS access point if the
       AccessPointId is provided. If you provide an EFS FileSystemId , it  re-
       turns  descriptions  of all access points for that file system. You can
       provide either an AccessPointId or a FileSystemId in the  request,  but
       not both.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  for  the  elasticfilesystem:De-
       scribeAccessPoints action.

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          (Optional) When retrieving all access points for a file system,  you
          can optionally specify the MaxItems parameter to limit the number of
          objects returned in a response. The default value is 100.

       --next-token (string)
          NextToken is present if the  response  is  paginated.  You  can  use
          NextMarker  in  the subsequent request to fetch the next page of ac-
          cess point descriptions.

       --access-point-id (string)
          (Optional) Specifies an EFS access point  to  describe  in  the  re-
          sponse; mutually exclusive with FileSystemId .

       --file-system-id (string)
          (Optional)  If  you  provide a FileSystemId , EFS returns all access
          points for that file system; mutually exclusive with AccessPointId .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

              RootDirectory -> (structure)
                 The  directory  on the Amazon EFS file system that the access

                 access point.

                 Path -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  path  on the EFS file system to expose as
                     the root directory to NFS clients using the access  point
                     to access the EFS file system. A path can have up to four
                     subdirectories. If the specified path does not exist, you

                        RootDirectory > Path does not exist, attempts to mount
                        the file system using the access point will fail.

                        tory . Accepts values from 0 to 2^32 (4294967295).
