DESCRIBE-LIFECYCLE-CONFIGURATION()          DESCRIBE-LIFECYCLE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       describe-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  current  LifecycleConfiguration  object for the specified
       Amazon EFS file system. Lifecycle management uses the LifecycleConfigu-
       ration  object  to identify when to move files between storage classes.
       For a file system without a LifecycleConfiguration object, the call re-
       turns an empty array in the response.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  for  the  elasticfilesystem:De-
       scribeLifecycleConfiguration operation.

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the file system whose  LifecycleConfiguration  object  you
          want to retrieve (String).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       LifecyclePolicies -> (list)
          An array of lifecycle management policies. EFS supports a maximum of
          one policy per file system.

          (structure)
              Describes a policy used by Lifecycle management  that  specifies
              when  to  transition  files into and out of storage classes. For
              more information, see Managing file system storage .

              NOTE:
                 When using the put-lifecycle-configuration CLI command or the
                 PutLifecycleConfiguration  API  action,  Amazon  EFS requires
                 that each LifecyclePolicy object have only a  single  transi-
                 tion.  This  means  that in a request body, LifecyclePolicies
                 must be structured as an array  of  LifecyclePolicy  objects,
                 one object for each transition. For more information, see the
                 request examples in  PutLifecycleConfiguration .

              TransitionToIA -> (string)
                 The number of days after files were last accessed in  primary
                 storage (the Standard storage class) at which to move them to
                 Infrequent Access (IA) storage. Metadata operations  such  as
                 listing  the  contents of a directory don't count as file ac-
                 cess events.

              TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass -> (string)
                 Whether to move files back to primary (Standard) storage  af-
                 ter  they are accessed in IA or Archive storage. Metadata op-
                 erations such as listing the contents of  a  directory  don't
                 count as file access events.

              TransitionToArchive -> (string)
                 The  number of days after files were last accessed in primary
                 storage (the Standard storage class) files at which  to  move
                 them  to Archive storage. Metadata operations such as listing
                 the contents of  a  directory  don't  count  as  file  access
                 events.
