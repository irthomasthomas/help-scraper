OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the file system to update.

       --replication-overwrite-protection (string)
          The status of the file system's replication overwrite protection.

          o ENABLED  The file system cannot be used as  the  destination  file
            system  in  a replication configuration. The file system is write-
            able. Replication overwrite protection is ENABLED by default.

          o DISABLED  The file system can be used as the destination file sys-
            tem  in  a replication configuration. The file system is read-only
            and can only be modified by EFS replication.

          o REPLICATING  The file system is being used as the destination file
            system   in  a  replication  configuration.  The  file  system  is
            read-only and is only modified only by EFS replication.

          If the replication  configuration  is  deleted,  the  file  system's
          replication  overwrite protection is re-enabled, the file system be-
          comes writeable.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

          o REPLICATING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ReplicationOverwriteProtection -> (string)
          The status of the file system's replication overwrite protection.

          o ENABLED  The file system cannot be used as  the  destination  file
            system  in  a replication configuration. The file system is write-
            able. Replication overwrite protection is ENABLED by default.

          o DISABLED  The file system can be used as the destination file sys-
            tem  in  a replication configuration. The file system is read-only
            and can only be modified by EFS replication.

          o REPLICATING  The file system is being used as the destination file
            system   in  a  replication  configuration.  The  file  system  is
            read-only and is only modified only by EFS replication.

          If the replication  configuration  is  deleted,  the  file  system's
          replication  overwrite protection is re-enabled, the file system be-
          comes writeable.
