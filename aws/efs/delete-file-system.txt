DELETE-FILE-SYSTEM()                                      DELETE-FILE-SYSTEM()



NAME
       delete-file-system -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  file  system,  permanently severing access to its contents.
       Upon return, the file system no longer exists and you can't access  any
       contents of the deleted file system.

       You need to manually delete mount targets attached to a file system be-
       fore you can delete an EFS file system. This step is performed for  you
       when you use the Amazon Web Services console to delete a file system.

       NOTE:
          You  cannot  delete a file system that is part of an EFS Replication
          configuration. You need  to  delete  the  replication  configuration
          first.

       You  can't  delete  a  file system that is in use. That is, if the file
       system has any mount targets, you must first delete them. For more  in-
       formation, see  DescribeMountTargets and  DeleteMountTarget .

       NOTE:
          The  DeleteFileSystem  call  returns  while the file system state is
          still deleting . You can check the file system  deletion  status  by
          calling  the  DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns a list of
          file systems in your account. If you pass file system ID or creation
          token  for the deleted file system, the  DescribeFileSystems returns
          a 404 FileSystemNotFound error.

       This operation requires permissions for  the  elasticfilesystem:Delete-
       FileSystem action.

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the file system you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
