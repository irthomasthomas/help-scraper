LIST-DEPLOYMENTS()                                          LIST-DEPLOYMENTS()



NAME
       list-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the deployments for an environment in descending deployment num-
       ber order.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-deployments
          --application-id <value>
          --environment-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The application ID.

       --environment-id (string)
          The environment ID.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items that may be returned for this  call.  If
          there  are  items that have not yet been returned, the response will
          include a non-null NextToken that you can provide  in  a  subsequent
          call to get the next set of results.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token returned by a prior call to this operation indicating the
          next set of results to be returned. If not specified, the  operation
          will return the first set of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the available deployments

       The  following list-deployments example lists the available deployments
       in your AWS account for the specified application and environment.

          aws appconfig list-deployments \
              --application-id 339ohji \
              --environment-id 54j1r29

       Output:

          {
              "Items": [
                  {
                      "DeploymentNumber": 1,
                      "ConfigurationName": "Example-Configuration-Profile",
                      "ConfigurationVersion": "1",
                      "DeploymentDurationInMinutes": 15,
                      "GrowthType": "LINEAR",
                      "GrowthFactor": 25.0,
                      "FinalBakeTimeInMinutes": 0,
                      "State": "COMPLETE",
                      "PercentageComplete": 100.0,
                      "StartedAt": "2021-09-17T21:43:54.205000+00:00",
                      "CompletedAt": "2021-09-17T21:59:03.888000+00:00"
                  }
              ]
          }
