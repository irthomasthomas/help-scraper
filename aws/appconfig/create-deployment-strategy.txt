NAME
       create-deployment-strategy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  deployment  strategy  that  defines  important criteria for
       rolling out your configuration to the designated targets. A  deployment
       strategy  includes  the overall duration required, a percentage of tar-
       gets to receive the deployment during each interval, an algorithm  that
       defines how percentage grows, and bake time.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A name for the deployment strategy.

       --description (string)
          A description of the deployment strategy.

       --deployment-duration-in-minutes (integer)
          Total amount of time for a deployment to last.

       --final-bake-time-in-minutes (integer)
          Specifies  the  amount  of time AppConfig monitors for Amazon Cloud-
          Watch alarms after the configuration has been deployed  to  100%  of
          its targets, before considering the deployment to be complete. If an
          alarm is triggered during this time, AppConfig rolls  back  the  de-
          ployment.  You must configure permissions for AppConfig to roll back
          based on CloudWatch alarms. For more  information,  see  Configuring
          permissions  for  rollback  based on Amazon CloudWatch alarms in the
          AppConfig User Guide .

       --growth-factor (float)
          The percentage of targets to receive a deployed configuration during
          each interval.

       --growth-type (string)
          The algorithm used to define how percentage grows over time. AppCon-
          fig supports the following growth types:
              Linear : For this type, AppConfig processes  the  deployment  by
              dividing  the total number of targets by the value specified for
              Step percentage . For example, a linear deployment that  uses  a
              Step percentage of 10 deploys the configuration to 10 percent of
              the hosts. After those deployments are complete, the system  de-
              ploys  the  configuration to the next 10 percent. This continues
              until 100% of the targets have successfully received the config-
              uration.

              Exponential  : For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment
              exponentially using the following formula:  G*(2^N)  .  In  this
              formula,  G  is the growth factor specified by the user and N is
              the number of steps until the configuration is deployed  to  all
              targets.  For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then
              the system rolls out the configuration as follows:

              2*(2^0)

              2*(2^1)

              2*(2^2)

          Expressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as  follows:  2%  of
          the targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues un-
          til the configuration has been deployed to all targets.

          Possible values:

          o LINEAR

          o EXPONENTIAL

       --replicate-to (string)
          Save the deployment strategy to a Systems Manager (SSM) document.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o SSM_DOCUMENT

       --tags (map)
          Metadata to assign to the deployment strategy.  Tags  help  organize
          and  categorize your AppConfig resources. Each tag consists of a key
          and an optional value, both of which you define.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          The deployment strategy ID.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the deployment strategy.

          The  amount  of time that AppConfig monitored for alarms before con-
          sidering the deployment to be complete and no  longer  eligible  for
          automatic rollback.

       ReplicateTo -> (string)
          Save the deployment strategy to a Systems Manager (SSM) document.
