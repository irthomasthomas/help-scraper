LIST-EXTENSION-ASSOCIATIONS()                    LIST-EXTENSION-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-extension-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all AppConfig extension associations in the account. For more in-
       formation about extensions and associations, see Working with AppConfig
       extensions in the AppConfig User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-extension-associations  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: Items

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The ARN of an application, configuration profile, or environment.

       --extension-identifier (string)
          The name, the ID, or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  exten-
          sion.

       --extension-version-number (integer)
          The version number for the extension defined in the association.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list all AWS AppConfig extension associations in  your  AWS  account
       for an AWS Region

       The following list-extension-associations example lists all AWS AppCon-
       fig extension associations for the current AWS account  in  a  specific
       AWS Region.

          aws appconfig list-extension-associations \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {

                  {
                      "Id": "a1b2c3d4",
                      "ExtensionArn": "arn:aws:appconfig:us-west-2:123456789012:extension/S3-backup-extension/1",
                      "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:appconfig:us-west-2:123456789012:application/Finance"

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The list of extension associations. Each item represents  an  exten-
          sion  association  to  an application, environment, or configuration
          profile.

          (structure)
              Information about an association between an extension and an Ap-
              pConfig resource such as an application, environment, or config-
              uration profile. Call GetExtensionAssociation to get more infor-
              mation about an association.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  extension  association ID. This ID is used to call other
                 ExtensionAssociation API actions such as GetExtensionAssocia-
                 tion or DeleteExtensionAssociation .

              ExtensionArn -> (string)
                 The  system-generated  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the ex-
                 tension.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARNs of applications, configuration profiles, or environ-
                 ments defined in the association.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. Use this token to get
          the next set of results.
