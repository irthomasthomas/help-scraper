SYNOPSIS
            list-extension-associations
          [--resource-identifier <value>]
          [--extension-identifier <value>]
          [--extension-version-number <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The ARN of an application, configuration profile, or environment.

       --extension-identifier (string)
          The  name,  the  ID, or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the exten-
          sion.

       --extension-version-number (integer)
          The version number for the extension defined in the association.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return for this call. The  call  also
          returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the
          next set of results.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to start the list. Use this token to get the next set of re-
          sults or pass null to get the first set of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The list of extension associations. Each item represents  an  exten-
          sion  association  to  an application, environment, or configuration
          profile.

          (structure)
              Information about an association between an extension and an Ap-
              pConfig resource such as an application, environment, or config-
              uration profile. Call GetExtensionAssociation to get more infor-
              mation about an association.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  extension  association ID. This ID is used to call other
                 ExtensionAssociation API actions such as GetExtensionAssocia-
                 tion or DeleteExtensionAssociation .

              ExtensionArn -> (string)
                 The  system-generated  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the ex-
                 tension.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARNs of applications, configuration profiles, or environ-
                 ments defined in the association.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. Use this token to get
          the next set of results.
