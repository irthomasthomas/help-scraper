STOP-DEPLOYMENT()                                            STOP-DEPLOYMENT()



NAME
       stop-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops a deployment. This API action works only on deployments that have
       a status of DEPLOYING . This action moves the deployment to a status of
       ROLLED_BACK .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-deployment
          --application-id <value>
          --environment-id <value>
          --deployment-number <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The application ID.

       --environment-id (string)
          The environment ID.

       --deployment-number (integer)
          The sequence number of the deployment.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To stop configuration deployment

       The following stop-deployment example stops the deployment of an appli-
       cation configuration to the specified environment.

          aws appconfig stop-deployment \
              --application-id 339ohji \
              --environment-id 54j1r29 \
              --deployment-number 2

       Output:

          {
              "DeploymentNumber": 0,
              "DeploymentDurationInMinutes": 0,
              "GrowthFactor": 0.0,
              "FinalBakeTimeInMinutes": 0,
              "PercentageComplete": 0.0
          }
