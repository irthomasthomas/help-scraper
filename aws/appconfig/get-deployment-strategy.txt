GET-DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY()                            GET-DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY()



NAME
       get-deployment-strategy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information about a deployment strategy. A deployment strat-
       egy defines important criteria for rolling out  your  configuration  to
       the  designated targets. A deployment strategy includes the overall du-
       ration required, a percentage of targets to receive the deployment dur-
       ing  each interval, an algorithm that defines how percentage grows, and
       bake time.

SYNOPSIS
            get-deployment-strategy
          --deployment-strategy-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-strategy-id (string)
          The ID of the deployment strategy to get.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve details of a deployment strategy

       The following get-deployment-strategy example lists the details of  the
       specified deployment strategy.

          aws appconfig get-deployment-strategy \
              --deployment-strategy-id 1225qzk

       Output:

          {
              "Id": "1225qzk",
              "Name": "Example-Deployment",
              "DeploymentDurationInMinutes": 15,
              "GrowthType": "LINEAR",
              "GrowthFactor": 25.0,
              "FinalBakeTimeInMinutes": 0,
              "ReplicateTo": "SSM_DOCUMENT"
          }

       For more information, see Step 4: Creating a deployment strategy in the
       AWS AppConfig User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          The deployment strategy ID.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the deployment strategy.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the deployment strategy.

       DeploymentDurationInMinutes -> (integer)
          Total amount of time the deployment lasted.

       GrowthType -> (string)
          The algorithm used to define how percentage grew over time.

       GrowthFactor -> (float)
          The percentage of targets that  received  a  deployed  configuration
          during each interval.

       FinalBakeTimeInMinutes -> (integer)

          automatic rollback.

       ReplicateTo -> (string)
          Save the deployment strategy to a Systems Manager (SSM) document.
