PUT-ACCOUNT-SETTING()                                    PUT-ACCOUNT-SETTING()



NAME
       put-account-setting -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  an  account setting. Account settings are set on a per-Region
       basis.

       If you change the account setting for the root user, the  default  set-
       tings  for  all  of  the IAM users and roles that no individual account
       setting was specified are reset for. For more information, see  Account
       Settings in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       When  serviceLongArnFormat  , taskLongArnFormat , or containerInstance-
       LongArnFormat are specified, the Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  and  re-
       source  ID  format  of  the resource type for a specified IAM user, IAM
       role, or the root user for an  account  is  affected.  The  opt-in  and
       opt-out  account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource sepa-
       rately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by  the
       opt-in  status  of  the IAM user or role that created the resource. You
       must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such  as  resource
       tagging.

       When  awsvpcTrunking  is specified, the elastic network interface (ENI)
       limit for any new container  instances  that  support  the  feature  is
       changed. If awsvpcTrunking is enabled, any new container instances that
       support the feature are launched have the increased ENI  limits  avail-
       able  to  them.  For  more  information,  see Elastic Network Interface
       Trunking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       When containerInsights is specified,  the  default  setting  indicating
       whether  CloudWatch  Container Insights is enabled for your clusters is
       changed. If containerInsights is enabled, any  new  clusters  that  are
       created will have Container Insights enabled unless you disable it dur-
       ing cluster creation. For more information,  see  CloudWatch  Container
       Insights in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  Amazon  ECS  resource name for which to modify the account set-
          ting. If serviceLongArnFormat is specified, the ARN for your  Amazon
          ECS services is affected. If taskLongArnFormat is specified, the ARN
          and resource ID for your Amazon ECS tasks is affected. If container-
          InstanceLongArnFormat is specified, the ARN and resource ID for your
          Amazon ECS container instances is  affected.  If  awsvpcTrunking  is
          specified, the elastic network interface (ENI) limit for your Amazon
          ECS container instances is affected. If containerInsights is  speci-
          fied, the default setting for CloudWatch Container Insights for your
          clusters is affected.

          Possible values:

          o serviceLongArnFormat

          o taskLongArnFormat

          o containerInstanceLongArnFormat

          o awsvpcTrunking

          o containerInsights

       --value (string)
          The account setting value for the specified principal ARN.  Accepted
          values are enabled and disabled .

       --principal-arn (string)
          The ARN of the principal, which can be an IAM user, IAM role, or the
          root user. If you specify the root user,  it  modifies  the  account
          setting  for  all IAM users, IAM roles, and the root user of the ac-
          count unless an IAM user or role  explicitly  overrides  these  set-
          tings. If this field is omitted, the setting is changed only for the
          authenticated user.

          NOTE:
              Federated users assume the account setting of the root user  and
              can't have explicit account settings set for them.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify the account setting for your IAM user account

       The  following  put-account-setting  example enables the serviceLongAr-
       nFormat account setting for your IAM user account.

          aws ecs put-account-setting --name serviceLongArnFormat --value enabled

       Output:

          {
              "setting": {
                  "name": "serviceLongArnFormat",
                  "value": "enabled",
                  "principalArn": "arn:aws:iam::130757420319:user/your_username"
              }
          }
