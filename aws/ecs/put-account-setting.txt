PUT-ACCOUNT-SETTING()                                    PUT-ACCOUNT-SETTING()



NAME
       put-account-setting -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  an  account setting. Account settings are set on a per-Region
       basis.

       If you change the root user account setting, the default  settings  are
       reset for users and roles that do not have specified individual account
       settings. For more information, see  Account  Settings  in  the  Amazon
       Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       When  you  specify  serviceLongArnFormat  , taskLongArnFormat , or con-
       tainerInstanceLongArnFormat , the Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  and  re-
       source  ID  format  of the resource type for a specified user, role, or
       the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in  and  opt-out  ac-
       count  setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The
       ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in  sta-
       tus  of  the  user  or role that created the resource. You must turn on
       this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging.

       When you specify awsvpcTrunking , the elastic network  interface  (ENI)
       limit  for  any  new  container  instances  that support the feature is
       changed. If awsvpcTrunking is turned on, any  new  container  instances
       that  support  the  feature  are launched have the increased ENI limits
       available to them. For more information, see Elastic Network  Interface
       Trunking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       When  you  specify  containerInsights  , the default setting indicating
       whether Amazon Web Services CloudWatch Container Insights is turned  on
       for  your  clusters  is changed. If containerInsights is turned on, any
       new clusters that are created will have Container  Insights  turned  on
       unless  you  disable  it during cluster creation. For more information,
       see CloudWatch Container Insights in the Amazon Elastic Container  Ser-
       vice Developer Guide .

       Amazon  ECS is introducing tagging authorization for resource creation.
       Users must have permissions for actions that create the resource,  such
       as ecsCreateCluster . If tags are specified when you create a resource,
       Amazon Web Services performs  additional  authorization  to  verify  if
       users  or  roles  have  permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must
       grant explicit permissions to use the ecs:TagResource action. For  more
       information,  see  Grant permission to tag resources on creation in the
       Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

       When Amazon Web Services determines that a security  or  infrastructure
       update  is  needed  for an Amazon ECS task hosted on Fargate, the tasks
       need to be stopped and new tasks launched to replace them. Use fargate-
       TaskRetirementWaitPeriod to configure the wait time to retire a Fargate
       task. For information about the Fargate tasks maintenance,  see  Amazon
       Web Services Fargate task maintenance in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide
       .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The Amazon ECS resource name for which to modify  the  account  set-
          ting.  If you specify serviceLongArnFormat , the ARN for your Amazon
          ECS services is affected. If you specify taskLongArnFormat , the ARN
          and  resource ID for your Amazon ECS tasks is affected. If you spec-
          ify containerInstanceLongArnFormat , the ARN  and  resource  ID  for
          your  Amazon  ECS  container  instances  is affected. If you specify
          awsvpcTrunking , the elastic network interface (ENI) limit for  your
          Amazon  ECS  container  instances  is  affected. If you specify con-
          tainerInsights , the default setting for Amazon Web Services  Cloud-
          Watch Container Insights for your clusters is affected. If you spec-
          ify fargateFIPSMode , Fargate FIPS 140 compliance  is  affected.  If
          you specify tagResourceAuthorization , the opt-in option for tagging
          resources on creation is affected. For information about the  opt-in
          timeline,  see  Tagging authorization timeline in the Amazon ECS De-
          veloper Guide . If you specify fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod , the
          wait time to retire a Fargate task is affected.

          Possible values:

          o serviceLongArnFormat

          o taskLongArnFormat

          o containerInstanceLongArnFormat

          o awsvpcTrunking

          o containerInsights

          o fargateFIPSMode

          o tagResourceAuthorization

          o fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod

       --value (string)
          The  account setting value for the specified principal ARN. Accepted
          values are enabled , disabled , on , and off .

          When you specify fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod for the name ,  the
          following are the valid values:

          o 0  -  Amazon  Web Services sends the notification, and immediately
            retires the affected tasks.

          o 7 - Amazon Web Services sends the notification, and waits 7 calen-
            dar days to retire the tasks.

          o 14 - Amazon Web Services sends the notification, and waits 14 cal-
            endar days to retire the tasks.

       --principal-arn (string)
          The ARN of the principal, which can be a user,  role,  or  the  root
          user.  If you specify the root user, it modifies the account setting
          for all users, roles, and the root user of the account unless a user
          or  role explicitly overrides these settings. If this field is omit-
          ted, the setting is changed only for the authenticated user.

          NOTE:
              You must use the root user when you set the  Fargate  wait  time
              (fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod ).

              Federated  users assume the account setting of the root user and
              can't have explicit account settings set for them.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify the account setting for your IAM user account

       The following put-account-setting example  enables  the  serviceLongAr-
       nFormat account setting for your IAM user account.

          aws ecs put-account-setting --name serviceLongArnFormat --value enabled

       Output:

          {
              "setting": {
                  "name": "serviceLongArnFormat",
                  "value": "enabled",
                  "principalArn": "arn:aws:iam::130757420319:user/your_username"
              }
          }
