LIST-SERVICE-DEPLOYMENTS()                          LIST-SERVICE-DEPLOYMENTS()



NAME
       list-service-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  lists all the service deployments that meet the speci-
       fied filter criteria.

       A service deployment happens when you release a softwre update for  the
       service.  You  route  traffic from the running service revisions to the
       new service revison and control the number of running tasks.

       This API returns the values that you use for the request parameters  in
       DescribeServiceRevisions .

OPTIONS
       --service (string)
          The ARN or name of the service

       --cluster (string)
          The  cluster  that hosts the service. This can either be the cluster
          name or ARN. Starting April 15, 2023, Amazon Web Services  will  not
          onboard  new  customers  to  Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will
          help current customers migrate their workloads to options that offer
          better  price  and performanceIf you don't specify a cluster, deault
          is used.

       --status (list)
          An optional filter you can use to narrow the results. If you do  not
          specify a status, then all status values are included in the result.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            PENDING
            SUCCESSFUL
            STOPPED
            STOP_REQUESTED
            IN_PROGRESS
            ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS
            ROLLBACK_SUCCESSFUL
            ROLLBACK_FAILED

       --created-at (structure)
          An  optional filter you can use to narrow the results by the service
          creation date. If you do not specify a value,  the  result  includes
          all  services  created  before  the  current  time.  The  format  is
          yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.

          before -> (timestamp)
              Include service deployments in the result that were created  be-
              fore this time. The format is yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.

          after -> (timestamp)
              Include  service deployments in the result that were created af-
              ter this time. The format is yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          before=timestamp,after=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "before": timestamp,
            "after": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken value returned from a  ListServiceDeployments  request
          indicating  that  more  results are available to fulfill the request
          and further calls are needed. If you provided maxResults , it's pos-
          sible the number of results is fewer than maxResults .

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of service deployment results that ListServiceDe-
          ployments returned in paginated output. When this parameter is used,
          ListServiceDeployments  only  returns maxResults results in a single
          page along with a nextToken response element. The remaining  results
          of the initial request can be seen by sending another ListServiceDe-
          ployments request with the returned nextToken value. This value  can
          be  between  1  and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then ListSer-
          viceDeployments returns up to 20 results and a  nextToken  value  if
          applicable.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
