LIST-SERVICES-BY-NAMESPACE()                      LIST-SERVICES-BY-NAMESPACE()



NAME
       list-services-by-namespace -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  lists  all  of the services that are associated with a
       Cloud Map namespace. This list  might  include  services  in  different
       clusters. In contrast, ListServices can only list services in one clus-
       ter at a time. If you need to filter the list of services in  a  single
       cluster by various parameters, use ListServices . For more information,
       see Service Connect in the Amazon Elastic Container  Service  Developer
       Guide .

       list-services-by-namespace is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: serviceArns

OPTIONS
       --namespace (string)
          The namespace name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Cloud
          Map namespace to list the services in.

          Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to ser-
          vices in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all  of
          the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy
          container that collects logs and metrics for  increased  visibility.
          Only  the  tasks  that Amazon ECS services create are supported with
          Service Connect. For more information, see Service  Connect  in  the
          Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       serviceArns -> (list)
          The list of full ARN entries for each service that's associated with
          the specified namespace.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in a  future  ListServicesByNamespace
          request.  When  the results of a ListServicesByNamespace request ex-
          ceed maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve the  next  page
          of  results. When there are no more results to return, this value is
          null .
