UPDATE-TASK-PROTECTION()                              UPDATE-TASK-PROTECTION()



NAME
       update-task-protection -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the protection status of a task. You can set protectionEnabled
       to true to protect your task from termination  during  scale-in  events
       from Service Autoscaling or deployments .

       Task-protection,  by default, expires after 2 hours at which point Ama-
       zon ECS clears the protectionEnabled property making the task  eligible
       for termination by a subsequent scale-in event.

       You  can  specify a custom expiration period for task protection from 1
       minute to up to 2,880 minutes (48 hours). To specify the custom expira-
       tion  period,  set  the expiresInMinutes property. The expiresInMinutes
       property is always reset when you invoke this operation for a task that
       already  has protectionEnabled set to true . You can keep extending the
       protection expiration period of a task by invoking this  operation  re-
       peatedly.

       To  learn more about Amazon ECS task protection, see Task scale-in pro-
       tection in the * Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide * .

       NOTE:
          This operation is only supported for tasks belonging  to  an  Amazon
          ECS  service. Invoking this operation for a standalone task will re-
          sult in an TASK_NOT_VALID failure. For  more  information,  see  API
          failure reasons .

       WARNING:
          If  you  prefer to set task protection from within the container, we
          recommend using the Task scale-in protection endpoint .

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  cluster
          that hosts the service that the task sets exist in.

       --tasks (list)
          A list of up to 10 task IDs or full ARN entries.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --protection-enabled | --no-protection-enabled (boolean)
          Specify  true  to mark a task for protection and false to unset pro-
          tection, making it eligible for termination.

       --expires-in-minutes (integer)
          If you set protectionEnabled to true , you can specify the  duration
          for  task  protection  in  minutes.  You  can specify a value from 1
          minute to up to 2,880 minutes (48 hours).  During  this  time,  your
          task  will  not  be  terminated by scale-in events from Service Auto
          Scaling or deployments. After this time period lapses, protectionEn-
          abled will be reset to false .

          If  you  dont  specify the time, then the task is automatically pro-
          tected for 120 minutes (2 hours).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       protectedTasks -> (list)
          A list of tasks with the following information.

          o taskArn : The task ARN.

          o protectionEnabled : The protection status of the task. If scale-in
            protection is turned on for a task, the value is true . Otherwise,
            it is false .

          o expirationDate : The epoch time when protection for the task  will
            expire.

          (structure)
              An object representing the protection status details for a task.
              You can set the protection status with the  UpdateTaskProtection

                 The task ARN.

              protectionEnabled -> (boolean)
                 The  protection status of the task. If scale-in protection is
                 on for a task, the value is true . Otherwise, it is false .

              expirationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The epoch time when protection for the task will expire.

       failures -> (list)
          Any failures associated with the call.

          (structure)
