OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full ARN of the cluster that hosts the container.

       --task (string)
          The task ID or full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  task  that
          hosts the container.

       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container.

       --runtime-id (string)
          The ID of the Docker container.

       --status (string)

       --exit-code (integer)
          The exit code that's returned for the state change request.

       --reason (string)
          The reason for the state change request.

       --network-bindings (list)
          The network bindings of the container.

          (structure)
              Details on the network bindings between a container and its host
              container instance. After a task  reaches  the  RUNNING  status,
              manual  and  automatic  host  and container port assignments are
              visible in the networkBindings section of  DescribeTasks API re-
              sponses.

              bindIP -> (string)
                 The  IP  address  that  the container is bound to on the con-
                 tainer instance.

              containerPort -> (integer)
                 The port number on the container that's used with the network
                 binding.

              hostPort -> (integer)
                 The  port  number  on  the  host that's used with the network
                 binding.

              protocol -> (string)
                 The protocol used for the network binding.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bindIP=string,containerPort=integer,hostPort=integer,protocol=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "bindIP": "string",
              "containerPort": integer,
              "hostPort": integer,
              "protocol": "tcp"|"udp"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
