OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full ARN of the cluster that hosts the container.

       --task (string)
          The task ID or full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  task  that
          hosts the container.

       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container.

       --runtime-id (string)
          The ID of the Docker container.

       --status (string)
          The status of the state change request.

       --exit-code (integer)
          The exit code that's returned for the state change request.

       --reason (string)
          The reason for the state change request.

       --network-bindings (list)
          The network bindings of the container.

          (structure)
              Details on the network bindings between a container and its host
              container instance. After a task  reaches  the  RUNNING  status,
              manual  and  automatic  host  and container port assignments are
              visible in the networkBindings section of DescribeTasks API  re-
              sponses.

              bindIP -> (string)
                 The  IP  address  that  the container is bound to on the con-
                 tainer instance.

              containerPort -> (integer)
                 The port number on the container that's used with the network
                 binding.

              hostPort -> (integer)
                 The  port  number  on  the  host that's used with the network
                 binding.

              protocol -> (string)
                 The protocol used for the network binding.

              containerPortRange -> (string)
                 The port number range on the container that's  bound  to  the
                 dynamically mapped host port range.

                 The  following  rules  apply when you specify a containerPor-
                 tRange :

                 o You must use either the bridge network mode or  the  awsvpc
                   network mode.

                 o This  parameter  is  available for both the EC2 and Fargate
                   launch types.

                 o This parameter is available for both the Linux and  Windows
                   operating systems.

                 o The container instance must have at least version 1.67.0 of
                   the container agent and at least version  1.67.0-1  of  the
                   ecs-init package

                 o You can specify a maximum of 100 port ranges per container.

                 o You do not specify a hostPortRange . The value of the host-
                   PortRange is set as follows:

                   o For containers in a task with the  awsvpc  network  mode,
                     the  hostPortRange  is  set to the same value as the con-
                     tainerPortRange . This is a static mapping strategy.

                   o For containers in a task with the  bridge  network  mode,
                     the  Amazon  ECS agent finds open host ports from the de-
                     fault ephemeral range and passes it  to  docker  to  bind
                     them to the container ports.

                 o The  containerPortRange  valid  values  are  between  1 and
                   65535.

                 o A port can only be included in one port  mapping  per  con-
                   tainer.

                 o You cannot specify overlapping port ranges.

                 o The  first port in the range must be less than last port in
                   the range.

                 o Docker recommends that you turn off the docker-proxy in the
                   Docker  daemon  config file when you have a large number of
                   ports. For more information, see Issue #11185 on the Github
                   website.   For  information  about  how  to  turn  off  the
                   docker-proxy in the Docker daemon config file,  see  Docker
                   daemon in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

                 You          can         call         `         DescribeTasks
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTasks.html`__
                 to  view  the hostPortRange which are the host ports that are
                 bound to the container ports.

              hostPortRange -> (string)
                 The port number range on the host that's used with  the  net-
                 work  binding. This is assigned is assigned by Docker and de-
                 livered by the Amazon ECS agent.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bindIP=string,containerPort=integer,hostPort=integer,protocol=string,containerPortRange=string,hostPortRange=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "bindIP": "string",
              "containerPort": integer,
              "hostPort": integer,
              "protocol": "tcp"|"udp",
              "containerPortRange": "string",
              "hostPortRange": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
