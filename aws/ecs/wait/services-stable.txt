SERVICES-STABLE()                                            SERVICES-STABLE()



NAME
       services-stable -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until  JMESPath query length(services[?!(length(deployments) == 1
       && runningCount == desiredCount)]) == 0 returns True when polling  with
       describe-services.  It  will  poll  every 15 seconds until a successful
       state has been reached. This will exit with a return code of 255  after
       40 failed checks.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            services-stable
          [--cluster <value>]
          --services <value>
          [--include <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)the cluster that
          hosts the service to describe. If you do not specify a cluster,  the
          default  cluster  is assumed. This parameter is required if the ser-
          vice or services you are describing were  launched  in  any  cluster
          other than the default cluster.

       --services (list)
          A list of services to describe. You may specify up to 10 services to
          describe in a single operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include (list)
          Determines whether you want to see the resource tags  for  the  ser-
          vice.  If  TAGS is specified, the tags are included in the response.
          If this field is omitted, tags aren't included in the response.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            TAGS

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To pause running until a service is confirmed to be stable

       The following wait example pauses and continues only after it can  con-
       firm  that  the  specified  service running on the specified cluster is
       stable. There is no output.

          aws ecs wait services-stable \
              --cluster MyCluster \
              --services MyService

       Example 2: To pause running until a task is confirmed to be running

       The following wait example pauses and continues only after  the  speci-
       fied task enters a RUNNING state.

          aws ecs wait services-stable \
              --cluster MyCluster \
              --tasks arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:task/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-44444EXAMPLE
