       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-account-setting
          --name <value>
          [--principal-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The resource name to disable the account setting for. If serviceLon-
          gArnFormat is specified, the ARN for your Amazon ECS services is af-
          fected. If taskLongArnFormat is specified, the ARN and  resource  ID
          for  your  Amazon ECS tasks is affected. If containerInstanceLongAr-
          nFormat is specified, the ARN and resource ID for  your  Amazon  ECS
          container instances is affected. If awsvpcTrunking is specified, the
          ENI limit for your Amazon ECS container instances is affected.

          Possible values:

          o serviceLongArnFormat

          o taskLongArnFormat

          o containerInstanceLongArnFormat

          o awsvpcTrunking

          o containerInsights

       --principal-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the principal. It can  be  an  IAM
          user,  IAM  role, or the root user. If you specify the root user, it
          disables the account setting for all IAM users, IAM roles,  and  the
          root user of the account unless an IAM user or role explicitly over-
          rides these settings. If this  field  is  omitted,  the  setting  is
          changed only for the authenticated user.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete the account settings for a specific IAM user or IAM role

       The  following  example delete-account-setting deletes the account set-
       tings for the specific IAM user or IAM role.

          aws ecs delete-account-setting \
              --name serviceLongArnFormat \
              --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/MyUser

       Output:

          {
              "setting": {
                  "name": "serviceLongArnFormat",
                  "value": "enabled",
                  "principalArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/MyUser"
              }
          }

       For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and IDs  in  the
       Amazon ECS Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       setting -> (structure)
          The account setting for the specified principal ARN.

          name -> (string)
              The Amazon ECS resource name.

          value -> (string)
              Determines  whether  the  account setting is enabled or disabled
              for the specified resource.

          principalArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the principal. It can be an IAM user,  IAM  role,  or
              the  root user. If this field is omitted, the authenticated user
              is assumed.
