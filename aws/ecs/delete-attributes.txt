OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster
          that contains the resource to delete attributes. If you do not spec-
          ify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

       --attributes (list)
          The  attributes  to delete from your resource. You can specify up to
          10 attributes for each request. For custom attributes,  specify  the
          attribute  name  and  target ID, but don't specify the value. If you
          specify the target ID using the short form, you  must  also  specify
          the target type.

          (structure)
              An attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with an Ama-
              zon ECS object. Use attributes to extend  the  Amazon  ECS  data
              model  by adding custom metadata to your resources. For more in-
              formation, see Attributes in the Amazon Elastic  Container  Ser-
              vice Developer Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the attribute. The name must contain between 1
                 and 128 characters. The name may contain  letters  (uppercase
                 and  lowercase),  numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), for-
                 ward slashes (/), back slashes (), or periods (.).

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute. The value must contain between  1
                 and  128  characters.  It  can contain letters (uppercase and
                 lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-),  underscores  (_),  periods
                 (.),  at  signs  (@),  forward  slashes (/), back slashes (),
                 colons (:), or spaces. The value can't  can't  start  or  end
                 with a space.

              targetType -> (string)
                 The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This pa-
                 rameter is required if you use the short form ID  for  a  re-
                 source instead of the full ARN.

              targetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the target. You can specify the short form ID for a
                 resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string,targetType=string,targetId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "targetType": "container-instance",
              "targetId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
