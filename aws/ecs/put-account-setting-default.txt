OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The resource name for which to modify the account setting.

          The following are the valid values for the account setting name.

          o serviceLongArnFormat  -  When  modified,  the Amazon Resource Name
            (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a  specified
            user,  role,  or  the  root  user  for an account is affected. The
            opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS
            resource  separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource
            is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role  that  created
            the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS fea-
            tures such as resource tagging.

          o taskLongArnFormat - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)
            and  resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user,
            role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in  and
            opt-out  account  setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource
            separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a  resource  is  de-
            fined  by  the  opt-in status of the user or role that created the
            resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features
            such as resource tagging.

          o containerInstanceLongArnFormat  -  When  modified,  the Amazon Re-
            source Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type  for
            a  specified  user,  role,  or the root user for an account is af-
            fected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting  must  be  set  for
            each  Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID for-
            mat of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the  user  or
            role  that  created the resource. You must turn on this setting to
            use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging.

          o awsvpcTrunking - When  modified,  the  elastic  network  interface
            (ENI)  limit for any new container instances that support the fea-
            ture is changed. If awsvpcTrunking is turned on, any new container
            instances that support the feature are launched have the increased
            ENI limits available to them. For more  information,  see  Elastic
            Network Interface Trunking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
            Developer Guide .

          o containerInsights - When modified, the default setting  indicating
            whether  Amazon  Web  Services  CloudWatch  Container  Insights is
            turned on for your clusters is changed.  If  containerInsights  is
            turned  on,  any new clusters that are created will have Container
            Insights turned on unless you disable it during cluster  creation.
            For  more  information,  see  CloudWatch Container Insights in the
            Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

          o dualStackIPv6 - When turned on, when using a  VPC  in  dual  stack
            mode,  your  tasks  using the awsvpc network mode can have an IPv6
            address assigned. For more information on using  IPv6  with  tasks
            launched  on  Amazon  EC2 instances, see Using a VPC in dual-stack
            mode . For more information on using IPv6 with tasks  launched  on
            Fargate, see Using a VPC in dual-stack mode .

          o fargateFIPSMode  -  If  you specify fargateFIPSMode , Fargate FIPS
            140 compliance is affected.

          o fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod - When Amazon Web Services  deter-
            mines  that  a  security or infrastructure update is needed for an
            Amazon ECS task hosted on Fargate, the tasks need  to  be  stopped
            and new tasks launched to replace them. Use fargateTaskRetirement-
            WaitPeriod to configure the wait time to retire  a  Fargate  task.
            For  information  about  the Fargate tasks maintenance, see Amazon
            Web Services Fargate task maintenance in the Amazon ECS  Developer
            Guide .

          o tagResourceAuthorization  -  Amazon ECS is introducing tagging au-
            thorization for resource creation. Users must have permissions for
            actions  that  create  the resource, such as ecsCreateCluster . If
            tags are specified when you create a resource, Amazon Web Services
            performs additional authorization to verify if users or roles have
            permissions to create tags. Therefore,  you  must  grant  explicit
            permissions  to  use the ecs:TagResource action. For more informa-
            tion, see Grant permission to tag resources  on  creation  in  the
            Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

          o guardDutyActivate  -  The guardDutyActivate parameter is read-only
            in Amazon ECS and indicates whether Amazon ECS Runtime  Monitoring
            is enabled or disabled by your security administrator in your Ama-
            zon ECS account. Amazon GuardDuty controls this account setting on
            your behalf. For more information, see Protecting Amazon ECS work-
            loads with Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring .

          Possible values:

          o serviceLongArnFormat

          o taskLongArnFormat

          o containerInstanceLongArnFormat

          o awsvpcTrunking

          o containerInsights

          o fargateFIPSMode

          o tagResourceAuthorization

          o fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod

          o guardDutyActivate

       --value (string)
          The account setting value for the specified principal ARN.  Accepted
          values are enabled , disabled , on , and off .

          When  you specify fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod for the name , the
          following are the valid values:

          o 0 - Amazon Web Services sends the  notification,  and  immediately
            retires the affected tasks.

          o 7 - Amazon Web Services sends the notification, and waits 7 calen-
            dar days to retire the tasks.

          o 14 - Amazon Web Services sends the notification, and waits 14 cal-
            endar days to retire the tasks.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify the default account settings

       The following put-account-setting-default example modifies the  default
       account  setting  for  all  IAM  users  or roles on your account. These
       changes apply to the entire AWS account unless an IAM user or role  ex-
       plicitly overrides these settings for themselves.

          aws ecs put-account-setting-default --name serviceLongArnFormat --value enabled

       Output:

          {
              "setting": {
                  "name": "serviceLongArnFormat",
                  "value": "enabled",
                  "principalArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
              }
          }

       For  more  information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and IDs in the
       Amazon ECS Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       setting -> (structure)
          The current setting for a resource.

          name -> (string)
              The Amazon ECS resource name.

          value -> (string)
              Determines whether the account setting is  on  or  off  for  the
              specified resource.

          principalArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the principal. It can be a user, role, or the root
              user. If this field is omitted, the authenticated  user  is  as-
              sumed.

          type -> (string)
              Indicates  whether  Amazon Web Services manages the account set-
              ting, or if the user manages it.
                 aws_managed account settings are  read-only,  as  Amazon  Web
                 Services  manages  such  on the customer's behalf. Currently,
                 the guardDutyActivate account setting is the only one  Amazon
                 Web Services manages.
