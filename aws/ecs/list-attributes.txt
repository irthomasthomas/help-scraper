LIST-ATTRIBUTES()                                            LIST-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       list-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the attributes for Amazon ECS resources within a specified target
       type and cluster. When you specify a target type and  cluster,  ListAt-
       tributes returns a list of attribute objects, one for each attribute on
       each resource. You can filter the list of results to a single attribute
       name  to  only  return results that have that name. You can also filter
       the results by attribute name and value. You can do this, for  example,
       to  see  which container instances in a cluster are running a Linux AMI
       (ecs.os-type=linux ).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-attributes is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: attributes

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster to
          list attributes. If you do not specify a cluster, the default  clus-
          ter is assumed.

       --target-type (string)
          The type of the target to list attributes with.

          Possible values:

          o container-instance

       --attribute-name (string)
          The name of the attribute to filter the results with.

       --attribute-value (string)
          The  value  of  the  attribute to filter results with. You must also
          specify an attribute name to use this parameter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the container instances that contain a specific attribute

       The following example lists the attributes for container instances that
       have the stack=production attribute in the default cluster.

          aws ecs list-attributes \
              --target-type container-instance \
              --attribute-name stack \
              --attribute-value production \
              --cluster default

       Output:

          {
              "attributes": [
                  {
                      "name": "stack",
                      "targetId": "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:130757420319:container-instance/1c3be8ed-df30-47b4-8f1e-6e68ebd01f34",
                      "value": "production"
                  }
              ]
          }

       the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       attributes -> (list)
          A list of attribute objects that meet the criteria of the request.

          (structure)
              An attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with an Ama-
              zon  ECS  object.  Use  attributes to extend the Amazon ECS data
              model by adding custom metadata to your resources. For more  in-
              formation,  see  Attributes in the Amazon Elastic Container Ser-
              vice Developer Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute. The name must  contain  between  1
                 and  128  characters. The name may contain letters (uppercase
                 and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), underscores  (_),  for-
                 ward slashes (/), back slashes (), or periods (.).

              value -> (string)
                 The  value of the attribute. The value must contain between 1
                 and 128 characters. It can  contain  letters  (uppercase  and
                 lowercase),  numbers,  hyphens  (-), underscores (_), periods
                 (.), at signs (@), forward  slashes  (/),  back  slashes  (),
                 colons  (:),  or  spaces. The value can't start or end with a
                 space.

              targetType -> (string)
                 The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This pa-
                 rameter  is  required  if you use the short form ID for a re-
                 source instead of the full ARN.

              targetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the target. You can specify the short form ID for a
                 resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future ListAttributes request.
          When the results of a ListAttributes  request  exceed  maxResults  ,
          this  value  can  be used to retrieve the next page of results. This
          value is null when there are no more results to return.
