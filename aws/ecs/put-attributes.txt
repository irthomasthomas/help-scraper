PUT-ATTRIBUTES()                                              PUT-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       put-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  or update an attribute on an Amazon ECS resource. If the attri-
       bute doesn't exist, it's created. If the attribute exists, its value is
       replaced  with  the  specified  value.  To  delete  an  attribute,  use
       DeleteAttributes . For more information, see Attributes in  the  Amazon
       Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-attributes
          [--cluster <value>]
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster
          that contains the resource to apply attributes. If you do not  spec-
          ify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

       --attributes (list)
          The  attributes  to apply to your resource. You can specify up to 10
          custom attributes for each resource. You can specify up  to  10  at-
          tributes in a single call.

          (structure)
              An attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with an Ama-
              zon ECS object. Use attributes to extend  the  Amazon  ECS  data
              model  by adding custom metadata to your resources. For more in-
              formation, see Attributes in the Amazon Elastic  Container  Ser-
              vice Developer Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the attribute. The name must contain between 1
                 and 128 characters. The name may contain  letters  (uppercase
                 and  lowercase),  numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), for-
                 ward slashes (/), back slashes (), or periods (.).

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute. The value must contain between  1
                 and  128  characters.  It  can contain letters (uppercase and
                 lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-),  underscores  (_),  periods
                 (.),  at  signs  (@),  forward  slashes (/), back slashes (),
                 colons (:), or spaces. The value can't  can't  start  or  end
                 with a space.

              targetType -> (string)
                 The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This pa-
                 rameter is required if you use the short form ID  for  a  re-
                 source instead of the full ARN.

              targetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the target. You can specify the short form ID for a
                 resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string,targetType=string,targetId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "targetType": "container-instance",
              "targetId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an attribute and associate it with an Amazon ECS resource

       The following put-attributes applies an attribute with the  name  stack
       and the value production to a container instance.

          aws ecs put-attributes \
              --attributes name=stack,value=production,targetId=arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:130757420319:container-instance/1c3be8ed-df30-47b4-8f1e-6e68ebd01f34

       Output:

          {
              "attributes": [
                  {
                      "name": "stack",
                      "targetId": "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:130757420319:container-instance/1c3be8ed-df30-47b4-8f1e-6e68ebd01f34",
                      "value": "production"
                  }
              ]
          }

              An attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with an Ama-
              zon ECS object. Use attributes to extend  the  Amazon  ECS  data

                 and  lowercase),  numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), for-
                 ward slashes (/), back slashes (), or periods (.).

                 lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-),  underscores  (_),  periods
                 (.),  at  signs  (@),  forward  slashes (/), back slashes (),
                 colons (:), or spaces. The value can't  can't  start  or  end

              targetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the target. You can specify the short form ID for a
