SYNOPSIS
            discover-poll-endpoint
          [--container-instance <value>]
          [--cluster <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-instance (string)
          The container instance ID or full ARN of the container instance. For
          more  information  about  the  ARN  format, see Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN) in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  cluster
          that the container instance belongs to.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
