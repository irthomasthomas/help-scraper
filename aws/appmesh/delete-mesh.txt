DELETE-MESH()                                                    DELETE-MESH()



NAME
       delete-mesh -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing service mesh.

       You  must  delete  all  resources  (virtual  services,  routes, virtual
       routers, and virtual nodes) in the service mesh before you  can  delete
       the mesh itself.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-mesh
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a service mesh

       The following delete-mesh example deletes the specified service mesh.

          aws appmesh delete-mesh \
              --mesh-name app1

       Output:

OUTPUT
       mesh -> (structure)
          The service mesh that was deleted.

          meshName -> (string)
              The name of the service mesh.

          metadata -> (structure)
              The associated metadata for the service mesh.

              arn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 created.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 last updated.

              meshOwner -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services IAM account ID of the service mesh
                 owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of
                 the  account that shared the mesh with your account. For more
                 information about  mesh  sharing,  see  Working  with  shared
                 meshes .

              resourceOwner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the resource owner.
                 If the account ID is not your own, then it's the  ID  of  the
                 mesh  owner  or  of  another  account that the mesh is shared
                 with. For more information about mesh  sharing,  see  Working
                 with shared meshes .

              uid -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the resource.

              version -> (long)
                 The version of the resource. Resources are created at version
                 1, and this version is incremented each time that they're up-
                 dated.

          spec -> (structure)
              The associated specification for the service mesh.

              egressFilter -> (structure)
                 The egress filter rules for the service mesh.

                 type -> (string)
                     The  egress filter type. By default, the type is DROP_ALL
                     , which allows egress only from virtual  nodes  to  other
                     defined resources in the service mesh (and any traffic to
                     *.amazonaws.com for Amazon Web Services API  calls).  You
                     can  set  the  egress  filter  type to ALLOW_ALL to allow
                     egress to any endpoint inside or outside of  the  service
                     mesh.

              serviceDiscovery -> (structure)
                 An  object  that represents the service discovery information
                 for a service mesh.

                 ipPreference -> (string)
                     The IP version to use to control traffic within the mesh.

          status -> (structure)
              The status of the service mesh.

              status -> (string)
                 The current mesh status.
