LIST-VIRTUAL-GATEWAYS()                                LIST-VIRTUAL-GATEWAYS()



NAME
       list-virtual-gateways -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of existing virtual gateways in a service mesh.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-virtual-gateways  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: virtualGateways

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to list virtual gateways in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If
          the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that
          shared the mesh with your account. For more information  about  mesh
          sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future ListVirtualGateways re-
          quest. When the results  of  a  ListVirtualGateways  request  exceed
          limit , you can use this value to retrieve the next page of results.
          This value is null when there are no more results to return.

       virtualGateways -> (list)
          The list of existing virtual  gateways  for  the  specified  service
          mesh.

          (structure)
              An  object  that represents a virtual gateway returned by a list
              operation.

              arn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 created.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 last updated.

              meshName -> (string)
                 The name of the service mesh that the resource resides in.

              meshOwner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of  the  service  mesh
                 owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of
                 the account that shared the mesh with your account. For  more
                 information  about  mesh  sharing,  see  Working  with shared
                 meshes .

              resourceOwner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the resource owner.
                 If  the  account  ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the
                 mesh owner or of another account  that  the  mesh  is  shared
                 with.  For  more  information about mesh sharing, see Working
                 with shared meshes .

              version -> (long)
                 The version of the resource. Resources are created at version
                 1, and this version is incremented each time that they're up-
                 dated.

              virtualGatewayName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource.
