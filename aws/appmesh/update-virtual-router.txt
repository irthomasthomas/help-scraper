OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens,  and
          underscores are allowed.

       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh that the virtual router resides in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If
          the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that
          shared  the  mesh with your account. For more information about mesh
          sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

       --spec (structure)
          The new virtual router specification to apply. This  overwrites  the
          existing data.

          listeners -> (list)
              The listeners that the virtual router is expected to receive in-
              bound traffic from. You can specify one listener.

              (structure)
                 An object that represents a virtual router listener.

                 portMapping -> (structure)
                     An object that represents a port mapping.

                     port -> (integer)
                        The port used for the port mapping.

                     protocol -> (string)
                        The protocol used for the port  mapping.  Specify  one
                        protocol.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "listeners": [
              {
                "portMapping": {
                  "port": integer,
                  "protocol": "http"|"tcp"|"http2"|"grpc"
                }
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --virtual-router-name (string)
          The name of the virtual router to update.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a virtual router

       The following update-virtual-router example uses a JSON input  file  to
       update a virtual router listener port.

          aws appmesh update-virtual-router \
              --cli-input-json file://update-virtual-router.json

       Contents of update-virtual-router.json:

          {
              "meshName": "app1",
              "spec": {
                  "listeners": [
