NAME
       update-mesh -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an existing service mesh.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-mesh
          [--client-token <value>]
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--spec <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens,  and
          underscores are allowed.

       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to update.

       --spec (structure)
          The service mesh specification to apply.

          egressFilter -> (structure)
              The egress filter rules for the service mesh.

              type -> (string)
                 The  egress  filter  type. By default, the type is DROP_ALL ,
                 which allows egress only from virtual nodes to other  defined
                 resources  in  the service mesh (and any traffic to *.amazon-
                 aws.com for Amazon Web Services API calls). You can  set  the
                 egress  filter  type to ALLOW_ALL to allow egress to any end-
                 point inside or outside of the service mesh.

          serviceDiscovery -> (structure)
              An object that represents the service discovery information  for
              a service mesh.

              ipPreference -> (string)
                 The IP version to use to control traffic within the mesh.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          egressFilter={type=string},serviceDiscovery={ipPreference=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "egressFilter": {
              "type": "ALLOW_ALL"|"DROP_ALL"
            },
            "serviceDiscovery": {
              "ipPreference": "IPv6_PREFERRED"|"IPv4_PREFERRED"|"IPv4_ONLY"|"IPv6_ONLY"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a service mesh

       The following update-mesh example uses a JSON input file  to  update  a
       service  mesh  to  allow  all  external  egress traffic to be forwarded
       through the Envoy proxy untouched.

          aws appmesh update-mesh \
              --cli-input-json file://update-mesh.json

       Contents of update-mesh.json:

          {
              "meshName": "app1",
              "spec": {
                  "egressFilter": {
                      "type": "ALLOW_ALL"
                  }
              }
          }

       Output:

          {
              "mesh": {
                  "meshName": "app1",

              }
          }

                 The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of  the  service  mesh
                 owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of
                 the account that shared the mesh with your account. For  more
                 information  about  mesh  sharing,  see  Working  with shared
