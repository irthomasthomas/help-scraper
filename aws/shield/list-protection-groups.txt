NAME
       list-protection-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves   ProtectionGroup  objects  for the account. You can retrieve
       all protection groups or you can provide  filtering  criteria  and  re-
       trieve just the subset of protection groups that match the criteria.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-protection-groups
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--inclusion-filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          When  you request a list of objects from Shield Advanced, if the re-
          sponse does not include all  of  the  remaining  available  objects,
          Shield  Advanced includes a NextToken value in the response. You can
          retrieve the next batch of objects by requesting the list again  and
          providing  the token that was returned by the prior call in your re-
          quest.

          You can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want  Shield
          Advanced  to  return  for a single call with the MaxResults setting.
          Shield Advanced will not return more than  MaxResults  objects,  but
          may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.

          Whenever  more  objects  remain that Shield Advanced has not yet re-
          turned to you, the response will include a NextToken value.

          On your first call to a list operation, leave this setting empty.

       --max-results (integer)
          The greatest number of objects that you want Shield Advanced to  re-
          turn to the list request. Shield Advanced might return fewer objects
          than you indicate in this setting, even if more objects  are  avail-
          able.  If there are more objects remaining, Shield Advanced will al-
          ways also return a NextToken value in the response.

          The default setting is 20.

       --inclusion-filters (structure)
          Narrows the set of protection groups that the  call  retrieves.  You
          can  retrieve  a single protection group by its name and you can re-
          trieve all protection groups that are configured with specific  pat-
          tern or aggregation settings. You can provide up to one criteria per
          filter type. Shield Advanced returns the protection groups that  ex-
          actly match all of the search criteria that you provide.

          ProtectionGroupIds -> (list)
              The ID of the protection group that you want to retrieve.

              (string)

          Patterns -> (list)
              The pattern specification of the protection groups that you want
              to retrieve.

              (string)

          ResourceTypes -> (list)
              The resource type configuration of the  protection  groups  that
              you want to retrieve. In the protection group configuration, you
              specify the resource type when you set the  group's  Pattern  to
              BY_RESOURCE_TYPE .

              (string)

          Aggregations -> (list)
              The  aggregation  setting of the protection groups that you want
              to retrieve.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProtectionGroupIds=string,string,Patterns=string,string,ResourceTypes=string,string,Aggregations=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProtectionGroupIds": ["string", ...],
            "Patterns": ["ALL"|"ARBITRARY"|"BY_RESOURCE_TYPE", ...],
            "ResourceTypes": ["CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION"|"ROUTE_53_HOSTED_ZONE"|"ELASTIC_IP_ALLOCATION"|"CLASSIC_LOAD_BALANCER"|"APPLICATION_LOAD_BALANCER"|"GLOBAL_ACCELERATOR", ...],
            "Aggregations": ["SUM"|"MEAN"|"MAX", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProtectionGroups -> (list)
          (structure)
              A  grouping  of protected resources that you and Shield Advanced
              can monitor as a collective. This resource grouping improves the
              accuracy of detection and reduces false positives.

              ProtectionGroupId -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the protection group. You use this to identify
                 the protection group in lists and to  manage  the  protection
                 group, for example to update, delete, or describe it.

              Aggregation -> (string)
                 Defines  how  Shield  combines resource data for the group in
                 order to detect, mitigate, and report events.

                 o Sum - Use the total traffic across the  group.  This  is  a
                   good choice for most cases. Examples include Elastic IP ad-
                   dresses for EC2 instances that scale manually or  automati-
                   cally.

                 o Mean  -  Use  the  average of the traffic across the group.
                   This is a good choice for resources that share traffic uni-
                   formly. Examples include accelerators and load balancers.

                 o Max  -  Use the highest traffic from each resource. This is
                   useful for resources that don't share traffic and  for  re-
                   sources that share that traffic in a non-uniform way. Exam-
                   ples include Amazon CloudFront distributions and origin re-
                   sources for CloudFront distributions.

              Pattern -> (string)
                 The criteria to use to choose the protected resources for in-
                 clusion in the group. You can include all resources that have
                 protections, provide a list of resource ARNs (Amazon Resource
                 Names), or include all  resources  of  a  specified  resource
                 type.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The  resource  type  to  include in the protection group. All
                 protected resources of this type are included in the  protec-
                 tion  group. You must set this when you set Pattern to BY_RE-
                 SOURCE_TYPE and you must not set it  for  any  other  Pattern
                 setting.

              Members -> (list)
                 The  ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) of the resources to include
                 in the protection group. You must set this when you set  Pat-
                 tern  to ARBITRARY and you must not set it for any other Pat-
                 tern setting.

                 (string)

              ProtectionGroupArn -> (string)
                 The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the protection group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects from Shield Advanced, if the  re-
          sponse  does  not  include  all  of the remaining available objects,
          Shield Advanced includes a NextToken value in the response. You  can
          retrieve  the next batch of objects by requesting the list again and
          providing the token that was returned by the prior call in your  re-
          quest.

          You  can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want Shield
          Advanced to return for a single call with  the  MaxResults  setting.
          Shield  Advanced  will  not return more than MaxResults objects, but
          may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.

          Whenever more objects remain that Shield Advanced has  not  yet  re-
          turned to you, the response will include a NextToken value.
