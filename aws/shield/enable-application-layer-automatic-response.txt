ENABLE-APPLICATION-LAYER-AUTOMATIENABLE-APPLICATION-LAYER-AUTOMATIC-RESPONSE()



NAME
       enable-application-layer-automatic-response -

DESCRIPTION
       Enable  the Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation
       for the protected resource.

       NOTE:
          This feature is available for Amazon  CloudFront  distributions  and
          Application Load Balancers only.

       This  causes Shield Advanced to create, verify, and apply WAF rules for
       DDoS attacks that it detects for the resource. Shield Advanced  applies
       the rules in a Shield rule group inside the web ACL that you've associ-
       ated with the resource. For information about how automatic  mitigation
       works  and the requirements for using it, see Shield Advanced automatic
       application layer DDoS mitigation .

       NOTE:
          Don't use this action to make changes to automatic  mitigation  set-
          tings  when  it's  already enabled for a resource. Instead, use  Up-
          dateApplicationLayerAutomaticResponse .

       To use this feature, you must associate a web ACL  with  the  protected
       resource.  The  web ACL must be created using the latest version of WAF
       (v2). You can associate the web ACL through the Shield Advanced console
       at  https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/ . For more informa-
       tion, see Getting Started with Shield Advanced . You can also associate
       the web ACL to the resource through the WAF console or the WAF API, but
       you must manage Shield Advanced automatic mitigation through Shield Ad-
       vanced. For information about WAF, see WAF Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the protected resource.

       --action (structure)
          Specifies  the action setting that Shield Advanced should use in the
          WAF rules that it creates on behalf of the protected resource in re-
          sponse  to  DDoS attacks. You specify this as part of the configura-
          tion for the automatic application layer  DDoS  mitigation  feature,
          when you enable or update automatic mitigation. Shield Advanced cre-
          ates the WAF rules in a Shield Advanced-managed rule  group,  inside
          the web ACL that you have associated with the resource.

          Block -> (structure)
              Specifies  that  Shield  Advanced should configure its WAF rules
              with the WAF Block action.

              You must specify exactly one action, either Block or Count .

          Count -> (structure)
              Specifies that Shield Advanced should configure  its  WAF  rules
              with the WAF Count action.

              You must specify exactly one action, either Block or Count .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Block={},Count={}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Block": {

            },
            "Count": {

            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
