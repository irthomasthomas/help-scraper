       tiveEngagement and EnableProactiveEngagement .

       NOTE:

          least one phone number.

          NOTE:
              The  contacts  that  you  provide here replace any contacts that
              were already defined. If you already have contacts  defined  and
              want  to use them, retrieve the list using DescribeEmergencyCon-
              tactSettings and then provide it here.

              Contact information that the SRT can use to contact you  if  you
              have  proactive  engagement  enabled, for escalations to the SRT
              and to initiate proactive customer support.

              EmailAddress -> (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EmailAddress": "string",
              "PhoneNumber": "string",
              "ContactNotes": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
