OPTIONS
       --protection-group-id (string)
          The  name of the protection group. You use this to identify the pro-
          tection group in lists and to manage the protection group, for exam-
          ple to update, delete, or describe it.

       --next-token (string)
          When  you request a list of objects from Shield Advanced, if the re-
          sponse does not include all  of  the  remaining  available  objects,
          Shield  Advanced includes a NextToken value in the response. You can
          retrieve the next batch of objects by requesting the list again  and
          providing  the token that was returned by the prior call in your re-
          quest.

          You can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want  Shield
          Advanced  to  return  for a single call with the MaxResults setting.
          Shield Advanced will not return more than  MaxResults  objects,  but
          may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.

          Whenever  more  objects  remain that Shield Advanced has not yet re-
          turned to you, the response will include a NextToken value.

          On your first call to a list operation, leave this setting empty.

       --max-results (integer)
          The greatest number of objects that you want Shield Advanced to  re-
          turn to the list request. Shield Advanced might return fewer objects
          than you indicate in this setting, even if more objects  are  avail-
          able.  If there are more objects remaining, Shield Advanced will al-
          ways also return a NextToken value in the response.

          The default setting is 20.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResourceArns -> (list)
          The  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources that are included
          in the protection group.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects from Shield Advanced, if the  re-
          sponse  does  not  include  all  of the remaining available objects,
          Shield Advanced includes a NextToken value in the response. You  can
          retrieve  the next batch of objects by requesting the list again and
          providing the token that was returned by the prior call in your  re-
          quest.

          You  can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want Shield
          Advanced to return for a single call with  the  MaxResults  setting.
          Shield  Advanced  will  not return more than MaxResults objects, but
          may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.

          Whenever more objects remain that Shield Advanced has  not  yet  re-
          turned to you, the response will include a NextToken value.
