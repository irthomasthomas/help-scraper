NAME
       describe-attack-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  information  about  the number and type of attacks Shield has
       detected in the last year for all resources that  belong  to  your  ac-
       count,  regardless  of  whether  you've  defined Shield protections for
       them. This operation is available to Shield customers  as  well  as  to
       Shield Advanced customers.

       The operation returns data for the time range of midnight UTC, one year
       ago, to midnight UTC, today.  For  example,  if  the  current  time  is
       2020-10-26  15:39:32  PDT , equal to 2020-10-26 22:39:32 UTC , then the
       time range for the attack data returned is from 2019-10-26 00:00:00 UTC
       to 2020-10-26 00:00:00 UTC .

       The  time  range  indicates the period covered by the attack statistics
       data items.

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TimeRange -> (structure)
          The time range of the attack.

          FromInclusive -> (timestamp)
              The start time, in Unix time in seconds.

          ToExclusive -> (timestamp)
              The end time, in Unix time in seconds.

       DataItems -> (list)
          The data that describes the attacks detected during the time period.

          (structure)
              A single attack statistics data record. This is returned by  De-
              scribeAttackStatistics along with a time  range  indicating  the
              time period that the attack statistics apply to.

              AttackVolume -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the volume of attacks during the time pe-
                 riod. If the accompanying AttackCount is zero,  this  setting
                 might be empty.

                 BitsPerSecond -> (structure)
                     A  statistics  object  that  uses  bits per second as the
                     unit. This is included for network level attacks.

                     Max -> (double)
                        The maximum attack volume observed for the given unit.

                 PacketsPerSecond -> (structure)
                     A statistics object that uses packets per second  as  the
                     unit. This is included for network level attacks.

                     Max -> (double)
                        The maximum attack volume observed for the given unit.

                 RequestsPerSecond -> (structure)
                     A  statistics object that uses requests per second as the
                     unit. This is included for application level attacks, and
                     is  only  available  for  accounts that are subscribed to
                     Shield Advanced.

                     Max -> (double)
                        The maximum attack volume observed for the given unit.

              AttackCount -> (long)
                 The number of attacks detected during the time  period.  This
                 is always present, but might be zero.
