OPTIONS
       --protection-group-id (string)
          The  name of the protection group. You use this to identify the pro-
          tection group in lists and to manage the protection group, for exam-
          ple to update, delete, or describe it.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ProtectionGroup -> (structure)
          A grouping of protected resources that you and Shield  Advanced  can
          monitor  as  a collective. This resource grouping improves the accu-
          racy of detection and reduces false positives.

          ProtectionGroupId -> (string)
              The name of the protection group. You use this to  identify  the
              protection  group  in  lists and to manage the protection group,
              for example to update, delete, or describe it.

          Aggregation -> (string)
              Defines how Shield combines resource data for the group in order
              to detect, mitigate, and report events.

              o Sum  -  Use the total traffic across the group. This is a good
                choice for most cases. Examples include Elastic  IP  addresses
                for EC2 instances that scale manually or automatically.

              o Mean  -  Use the average of the traffic across the group. This
                is a good choice for resources that share  traffic  uniformly.
                Examples include accelerators and load balancers.

              o Max - Use the highest traffic from each resource. This is use-
                ful for resources that don't share traffic and  for  resources
                that share that traffic in a non-uniform way. Examples include
                Amazon  CloudFront  distributions  and  origin  resources  for
                CloudFront distributions.

          Pattern -> (string)
              The criteria to use to choose the protected resources for inclu-
              sion in the group. You can include all resources that have  pro-
              tections,  provide  a  list  of  resource  ARNs (Amazon Resource
              Names), or include all resources of a specified resource type.

          ResourceType -> (string)
              The resource type to include in the protection group.  All  pro-
              tected  resources  of  this  type are included in the protection
              group. You  must  set  this  when  you  set  Pattern  to  BY_RE-
              SOURCE_TYPE  and  you must not set it for any other Pattern set-
              ting.

          Members -> (list)
              The ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) of the resources to include  in
              the  protection group. You must set this when you set Pattern to
              ARBITRARY and you must not set it for any other Pattern setting.

              (string)

          ProtectionGroupArn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the protection group.
