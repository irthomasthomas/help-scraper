CREATE-PROTECTION()                                        CREATE-PROTECTION()



NAME
       create-protection -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  Shield  Advanced  for a specific Amazon Web Services resource.
       The resource can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon Route  53
       hosted  zone,  Global  Accelerator standard accelerator, Elastic IP Ad-
       dress, Application Load Balancer, or a Classic Load Balancer.  You  can
       protect  Amazon EC2 instances and Network Load Balancers by association
       with protected Amazon EC2 Elastic IP addresses.

       You can add protection to only a single resource with  each  CreatePro-
       tection  request.  You can add protection to multiple resources at once
       through       the       Shield        Advanced        console        at
       https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/  . For more information
       see Getting Started with Shield Advanced  and  Adding  Shield  Advanced
       protection to Amazon Web Services resources .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 78)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          o For an Elastic IP address:
            ``
            arn:aws:ec2:region :account-id :eip-allocation/allocation-id ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 80)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --tags (list)
          One or more tag key-value pairs for the  Protection object  that  is
          created.

          (structure)
              A  tag associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. Tags are
              key:value pairs that you can use to categorize and  manage  your
              resources,  for purposes like billing or other management. Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category, such as "environment",
              and  the tag value represents a specific value within that cate-
              gory, such as "test," "development,"  or  "production".  Or  you
              might  set  the  tag key to "customer" and the value to the cus-
              tomer name or ID. You can specify one or more  tags  to  add  to
              each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag key to describe a category of information, such as  "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag value to describe a specific  value  within  a  category,
                 such  as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To enable AWS Shield Advanced protection for a single AWS resource

       The following create-protection example enables Shield Advanced protec-
       tion for the specified AWS CloudFront distribution.

          aws shield create-protection \
              --name "Protection for CloudFront distribution" \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/E198WC25FXOWY8

       Output:

          {
              "ProtectionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For  more information, see Specify Your Resources to Protect in the AWS
       Shield Advanced Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ProtectionId -> (string)
          The unique identifier (ID) for the  Protection object that  is  cre-
          ated.
