          [--format <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]

          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]

OPTIONS
       command_id  (string)  The  ID of the CLI command to show. If this posi-
       tional argument is omitted, it will show the last the CLI command ran.

       --include (string) Specifies which events to only include when  showing
       the CLI command. This argument is mutually exclusive with --exclude.

       --exclude  (string)  Specifies which events to exclude when showing the
       CLI command. This argument is mutually exclusive with --include.

       --format (string) Specifies which format to use in showing  the  events
       for the specified CLI command. The following formats are supported:

          o detailed - This the default format. It prints out a detailed over-
            view of the CLI command ran. It displays all of the key events  in
            the  command  lifecycle where each important event has a title and
            its important values underneath. The events are ordered  by  time-
            stamp and events of the same API call are associated together with
            the [api_id] notation where events that share the same api_id  be-
            long to the lifecycle of the same API call.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.
