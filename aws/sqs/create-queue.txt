CREATE-QUEUE()                                                  CREATE-QUEUE()



NAME
       create-queue -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  standard  or  FIFO queue. You can pass one or more at-
       tributes in the request. Keep the following in mind:

       o If you don't specify the FifoQueue attribute, Amazon  SQS  creates  a
         standard queue.

       NOTE:
          You  can't  change  the queue type after you create it and you can't
          convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You  must  ei-
          ther create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your ex-
          isting standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more  in-
          formation,  see  Moving From a Standard Queue to a FIFO Queue in the
          Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       o If you don't provide a value for an attribute, the queue  is  created
         with the default value for the attribute.

       o If  you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before cre-
         ating a queue with the same name.

       To successfully create a new queue, you must provide a queue name  that
       adheres  to the limits related to queues and is unique within the scope
       of your queues.

       NOTE:
          After you create a queue, you must wait at least  one  second  after
          the queue is created to be able to use the queue.

       To   get  the  queue  URL,  use  the  ``   GetQueueUrl  ``  action.  ``
       GetQueueUrl `` requires only the QueueName parameter. be aware  of  ex-
       isting queue names:

       o If  you  provide  the  name of an existing queue along with the exact
         names and values of all the queue's attributes,  CreateQueue  returns
         the queue URL for the existing queue.

       o If  the  queue name, attribute names, or attribute values don't match
         an existing queue, CreateQueue returns an error.

       NOTE:
          Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For  more  in-
          formation, see Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a user-
          name in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --queue-name (string)
          The name of the new queue. The following limits apply to this name:

          o A queue name can have up to 80 characters.

          o Valid values: alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-  ),  and  under-
            scores (_ ).

          o A FIFO queue name must end with the .fifo suffix.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --attributes (map)
          A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

          The  following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the spe-
          cial request parameters that the CreateQueue action uses:

          o DelaySeconds  The length of time, in seconds, for which the deliv-
            ery  of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An in-
            teger from 0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0.

          o MaximumMessageSize  The limit of how many bytes a message can con-
            tain  before  Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from
            1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB).  Default:  262,144
            (256 KiB).

          o MessageRetentionPeriod   The length of time, in seconds, for which
            Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values:  An  integer  from  60
            seconds  (1  minute)  to  1,209,600  seconds  (14  days). Default:
            345,600 (4 days). When you change a queue's attributes, the change
            can  take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate
            throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to  the  MessageRe-
            tentionPeriod  attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact
            existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be  ex-
            pired  and  deleted if the MessageRetentionPeriod is reduced below
            the age of existing messages.

          o Policy  The queue's policy. A valid Amazon  Web  Services  policy.
            For  more information about policy structure, see Overview of Ama-
            zon Web Services IAM Policies in the IAM User Guide .

          o ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds  The length of time, in seconds, for
            which  a  ``   ReceiveMessage `` action waits for a message to ar-
            rive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.

          o VisibilityTimeout  The visibility timeout for the queue,  in  sec-
            onds.  Valid  values:  An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). De-
            fault: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout,  see
            Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          The following attributes apply only to dead-letter queues:

          o RedrivePolicy   The  string  that  includes the parameters for the
            dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON  ob-
            ject. The parameters are as follows:

            o deadLetterTargetArn   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the
              dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages  after  the
              value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.

            o maxReceiveCount   The  number of times a message is delivered to
              the source queue before being moved to  the  dead-letter  queue.
              Default:  10.  When  the  ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the
              maxReceiveCount for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the
              dead-letter-queue.

          o RedriveAllowPolicy   The  string  that includes the parameters for
            the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive  permission  and
            which  source  queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON ob-
            ject. The parameters are as follows:

            o redrivePermission  The permission type that defines which source
              queues  can  specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue.
              Valid values are:

              o allowAll  (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web  Ser-
                vices account in the same Region can specify this queue as the
                dead-letter queue.

              o denyAll  No source  queues  can  specify  this  queue  as  the
                dead-letter queue.

              o byQueue   Only queues specified by the sourceQueueArns parame-
                ter can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.

            o sourceQueueArns  The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the  source
              queues  that can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue and
              redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only  when  the
              redrivePermission  parameter is set to byQueue . You can specify
              up to 10 source queue ARNs. To allow more than 10 source  queues
              to specify dead-letter queues, set the redrivePermission parame-
              ter to allowAll .

          NOTE:
              The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue.
              Similarly,  the  dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also
              be a standard queue.

          The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption :

          o KmsMasterKeyId  The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed  customer
            master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more informa-
            tion, see Key Terms . While the alias of the Amazon  Web  Services
            managed  CMK for Amazon SQS is always alias/aws/sqs , the alias of
            a custom CMK can, for example, be
            ``
            alias/MyAlias `` . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Manage-
            ment Service API Reference .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 212)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          o KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds   The length of time, in seconds, for
            which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or  decrypt  mes-
            sages  before  calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds,
            between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24  hours).  De-
            fault:  300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better se-
            curity but results in more calls to KMS which might incur  charges
            after  Free  Tier. For more information, see How Does the Data Key
            Reuse Period Work?

          o SqsManagedSseEnabled  Enables server-side queue  encryption  using
            SQS  owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option
            is supported per queue (for example, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS ).

          The following attributes apply  only  to  FIFO  (first-in-first-out)
          queues :

          o FifoQueue   Designates  a queue as FIFO. Valid values are true and
            false . If you don't specify the FifoQueue attribute,  Amazon  SQS
            creates a standard queue. You can provide this attribute only dur-
            ing queue creation. You can't change it  for  an  existing  queue.
            When  you  set  this attribute, you must also provide the Message-
            GroupId for your messages explicitly. For  more  information,  see
            FIFO queue logic in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          o ContentBasedDeduplication   Enables  content-based  deduplication.
            Valid values are true  and  false  .  For  more  information,  see
            Exactly-once  processing  in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide . Note
            the following:

            o Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId .

              o You may provide a MessageDeduplicationId explicitly.

              o If you aren't able to provide a MessageDeduplicationId and you
                enable  ContentBasedDeduplication  for  your queue, Amazon SQS
                uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId us-
                ing  the  body  of  the message (but not the attributes of the
                message).

              o If you don't provide a MessageDeduplicationId  and  the  queue
                doesn't  have  ContentBasedDeduplication set, the action fails
                with an error.

              o If the queue has ContentBasedDeduplication set, your MessageD-
                eduplicationId overrides the generated one.

            o When ContentBasedDeduplication is in effect, messages with iden-
              tical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated
              as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.

            o If  you  send one message with ContentBasedDeduplication enabled
              and then another message with a MessageDeduplicationId  that  is
              the  same  as  the one generated for the first MessageDeduplica-
              tionId , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one
              copy of the message is delivered.

          The  following  attributes  apply  only  to high throughput for FIFO
          queues :

          o DeduplicationScope  Specifies whether message deduplication occurs
            at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup
            and queue .

          o FifoThroughputLimit  Specifies whether the FIFO  queue  throughput
            quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid val-
            ues are perQueue and  perMessageGroupId  .  The  perMessageGroupId
            value  is  allowed  only  when the value for DeduplicationScope is
            messageGroup .

          To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

          o Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup .

          o Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId .

          If you set these attributes to anything other than the values  shown
          for  enabling  high  throughput,  normal throughput is in effect and
          deduplication occurs as specified.

          For information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages
          in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       --tags (map)
          Add  cost  allocation tags to the specified Amazon SQS queue. For an
          overview, see Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues in the Amazon  SQS  De-
          veloper Guide .

          When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

          o Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended.

          o Tags  don't  have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags
            as character strings.

          o Tags are case-sensitive.

          o A new tag with a key identical to that of an  existing  tag  over-
            writes the existing tag.

          For a full list of tag restrictions, see Quotas related to queues in
          the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              To be able to tag  a  queue  on  creation,  you  must  have  the
              sqs:CreateQueue and sqs:TagQueue permissions.

              Cross-account  permissions  don't apply to this action. For more
              information, see Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a
              username in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a queue

       This  example creates a queue with the specified name, sets the message
       retention period to 3 days (3 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes  *  60  sec-
       onds),  and  sets  the queue's dead letter queue to the specified queue
       with a maximum receive count of 1,000 messages.

       Command:

          aws sqs create-queue --queue-name MyQueue --attributes file://create-queue.json

       Input file (create-queue.json):

          {
            "RedrivePolicy": "{\"deadLetterTargetArn\":\"arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:80398EXAMPLE:MyDeadLetterQueue\",\"maxReceiveCount\":\"1000\"}",
            "MessageRetentionPeriod": "259200"
          }

       Output:

          {
            "QueueUrl": "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyQueue"
          }

OUTPUT
       QueueUrl -> (string)
          The URL of the created Amazon SQS queue.
