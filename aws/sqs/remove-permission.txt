NAME
       remove-permission -

DESCRIPTION
       Revokes  any permissions in the queue policy that matches the specified
       Label parameter.

       NOTE:

          o Only the owner of a queue can remove permissions from it.

          o Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more in-
            formation,  see  Grant  cross-account  permissions to a role and a
            user name in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          o To remove the ability to change queue permissions, you  must  deny
            permission   to   the   AddPermission  ,  RemovePermission  ,  and
            SetQueueAttributes actions in your IAM policy.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            remove-permission
          --queue-url <value>
          --label <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the Amazon SQS queue from which permissions are removed.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --label (string)
          The identification of the permission to remove. This  is  the  label
          added using the ``  AddPermission `` action.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
