GET-QUEUE-ATTRIBUTES()                                  GET-QUEUE-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       get-queue-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets attributes for the specified queue.

       NOTE:
          To  determine whether a queue is FIFO , you can check whether Queue-
          Name ends with the .fifo suffix.

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the Amazon SQS queue whose attribute information  is  re-
          trieved.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --attribute-names (list)
          A list of attributes for which to retrieve information.

          The  AttributeNames  parameter is optional, but if you don't specify
          values for this parameter, the request returns empty results.

          NOTE:
              In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write  code
              that  calls  this  action,  we recommend that you structure your
              code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

          The following attributes are supported:

          WARNING:
              The ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed , ApproximateNumberOfMes-
              sagesNotVisible  ,  and  ApproximateNumberOfMessages metrics may
              not achieve consistency until at least 1 minute after  the  pro-
              ducers  stop  sending  messages. This period is required for the
              queue metadata to reach eventual consistency.

          o All  Returns all values.

          o ApproximateNumberOfMessages  Returns  the  approximate  number  of
            messages available for retrieval from the queue.

          o ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed  Returns the approximate number
            of messages in the queue that are delayed and  not  available  for
            reading  immediately. This can happen when the queue is configured
            as a delay queue or when a message has been sent with a delay  pa-
            rameter.

          o ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible    Returns  the  approximate
            number of messages that are in flight. Messages are considered  to
            be  in  flight if they have been sent to a client but have not yet
            been deleted or have not yet reached the end of  their  visibility
            window.

          o CreatedTimestamp   Returns  the time when the queue was created in
            seconds (epoch time ).

          o DelaySeconds  Returns the default delay on the queue in seconds.

          o LastModifiedTimestamp  Returns the time when the  queue  was  last
            changed in seconds (epoch time ).

          o MaximumMessageSize   Returns the limit of how many bytes a message
            can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it.

          o MessageRetentionPeriod  Returns the length of  time,  in  seconds,
            for  which Amazon SQS retains a message. When you change a queue's
            attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most  of  the
            attributes  to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes
            made to the MessageRetentionPeriod attribute can  take  up  to  15
            minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially
            causing them to be expired and deleted if the  MessageRetentionPe-
            riod is reduced below the age of existing messages.

          o Policy  Returns the policy of the queue.

          o QueueArn  Returns the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the queue.

          o ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds  Returns the length of time, in sec-
            onds, for which the ReceiveMessage action waits for a  message  to
            arrive.

          o VisibilityTimeout   Returns  the visibility timeout for the queue.
            For more information about the visibility timeout, see  Visibility
            Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          The following attributes apply only to dead-letter queues:

          o RedrivePolicy   The  string  that  includes the parameters for the
            dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON  ob-
            ject. The parameters are as follows:

            o deadLetterTargetArn   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the
              dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages  after  the
              value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.

            o maxReceiveCount   The  number of times a message is delivered to
              the source queue before being moved to  the  dead-letter  queue.
              Default:  10.  When  the  ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the
              maxReceiveCount for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the
              dead-letter-queue.

          o RedriveAllowPolicy   The  string  that includes the parameters for
            the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive  permission  and
            which  source  queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON ob-
            ject. The parameters are as follows:

            o redrivePermission  The permission type that defines which source
              queues  can  specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue.
              Valid values are:

              o allowAll  (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web  Ser-
                vices account in the same Region can specify this queue as the
                dead-letter queue.

              o denyAll  No source  queues  can  specify  this  queue  as  the
                dead-letter queue.

              o byQueue   Only queues specified by the sourceQueueArns parame-
                ter can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.

            o sourceQueueArns  The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the  source
              queues  that can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue and
              redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only  when  the
              redrivePermission  parameter is set to byQueue . You can specify
              up to 10 source queue ARNs. To allow more than 10 source  queues
              to specify dead-letter queues, set the redrivePermission parame-
              ter to allowAll .

          NOTE:
              The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue.
              Similarly,  the  dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also
              be a standard queue.

          The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption :

          o KmsMasterKeyId  Returns the ID of an Amazon Web  Services  managed
            customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more
            information, see Key Terms .

          o KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds  Returns the length of time, in  sec-
            onds,  for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or de-
            crypt messages before calling KMS again. For more information, see
            How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work? .

          o SqsManagedSseEnabled   Returns information about whether the queue
            is using SSE-SQS encryption using SQS owned encryption keys.  Only
            one  server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for ex-
            ample, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS ).

          The following attributes apply  only  to  FIFO  (first-in-first-out)
          queues :

          o FifoQueue   Returns  information  about whether the queue is FIFO.
            For more information, see FIFO queue logic in the Amazon  SQS  De-
            veloper Guide .

          NOTE:
              To  determine  whether  a  queue is FIFO , you can check whether
              QueueName ends with the .fifo suffix.

          o ContentBasedDeduplication  Returns whether content-based  dedupli-
            cation  is  enabled  for  the  queue.  For  more  information, see
            Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          The following attributes apply only  to  high  throughput  for  FIFO
          queues :

          o DeduplicationScope  Specifies whether message deduplication occurs
            at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup
            and queue .

          o FifoThroughputLimit   Specifies  whether the FIFO queue throughput
            quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid val-
            ues  are  perQueue  and  perMessageGroupId . The perMessageGroupId
            value is allowed only when the  value  for  DeduplicationScope  is
            messageGroup .

          To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

          o Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup .

          o Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId .

          If  you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown
          for enabling high throughput, normal throughput  is  in  effect  and
          deduplication occurs as specified.

          For information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages
          in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a queue's attributes

       This example gets all of the specified queue's attributes.

       Command:

          aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyQueue --attribute-names All

       Output:

          {
            "Attributes": {
              "ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible": "0",
              "RedrivePolicy": "{\"deadLetterTargetArn\":\"arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:80398EXAMPLE:MyDeadLetterQueue\",\"maxReceiveCount\":1000}",
              "MessageRetentionPeriod": "345600",
