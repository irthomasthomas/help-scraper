START-MESSAGE-MOVE-TASK()                            START-MESSAGE-MOVE-TASK()



NAME
       start-message-move-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  asynchronous  task to move messages from a specified source
       queue to a specified destination queue.

       NOTE:

          o This action is currently limited  to  supporting  message  redrive
            from  queues  that  are configured as dead-letter queues (DLQs) of
            other Amazon SQS queues only. Non-SQS queue sources of dead-letter
            queues,  such  as  Lambda  or Amazon SNS topics, are currently not
            supported.

          o In dead-letter queues redrive  context,  the  StartMessageMoveTask
            the  source  queue  is the DLQ, while the destination queue can be
            the original source queue (from which the messages were driven  to
            the dead-letter-queue), or a custom destination queue.

          o Only  one  active  message movement task is supported per queue at
            any given time.

OPTIONS
       --source-arn (string)
          The ARN of the queue that contains the messages to be moved  to  an-
          other queue. Currently, only ARNs of dead-letter queues (DLQs) whose
          sources are other Amazon SQS queues are accepted. DLQs whose sources
          are  non-SQS  queues,  such  as Lambda or Amazon SNS topics, are not
          currently supported.

       --destination-arn (string)
          The ARN of the queue that receives the moved messages. You  can  use
          this  field to specify the destination queue where you would like to
          redrive messages. If this field is left blank, the messages will  be
          redriven back to their respective original source queues.

       --max-number-of-messages-per-second (integer)
          The  number of messages to be moved per second (the message movement
          rate). You can use this field to define  a  fixed  message  movement
          rate.  The  maximum  value  for  messages per second is 500. If this
          field is left blank, the system will optimize the rate based on  the
          queue  message  backlog size, which may vary throughout the duration
          of the message movement task.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: *To start a message move task*

       The following start-message-move-task example  starts  a  message  move
       task  to  redrive  messages from the specified dead-letter queue to the
       source queue.

          aws sqs start-message-move-task \
              --source-arn arn:aws:sqs:us-west-2:80398EXAMPLE:MyQueue

       Output:

          {
              "TaskHandle": "AQEB6nR4...HzlvZQ=="
          }

       For more information, see This is the topic title in the Name  of  your
       guide.

       Example 2: *To start a message move task with a maximum rate*

       The  following  start-message-move-task  example  starts a message move
       task to redrive messages from the specified dead-letter  queue  to  the
       specified  destination  queue at a maximum rate of 50 messages per sec-
       ond.

          aws sqs start-message-move-task \
              --source-arn arn:aws:sqs:us-west-2:80398EXAMPLE:MyQueue1 \
              --destination-arn arn:aws:sqs:us-west-2:80398EXAMPLE:MyQueue2 \
              --max-number-of-messages-per-second 50

       Output:

          {
              "TaskHandle": "AQEB6nR4...HzlvZQ=="
          }

       For more information, see Amazon SQS API permissions: Actions  and  re-
       source reference in the Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       TaskHandle -> (string)
          An  identifier  associated with a message movement task. You can use
          this identifier to cancel a specified message  movement  task  using
          the CancelMessageMoveTask action.
