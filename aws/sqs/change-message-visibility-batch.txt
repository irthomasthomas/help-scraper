CHANGE-MESSAGE-VISIBILITY-BATCH()            CHANGE-MESSAGE-VISIBILITY-BATCH()



NAME
       change-message-visibility-batch -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  visibility  timeout of multiple messages. This is a batch
       version of ``  ChangeMessageVisibility .`` The result of the action  on
       each  message is reported individually in the response. You can send up
       to 10 ``  ChangeMessageVisibility  ``  requests  with  each  ChangeMes-
       sageVisibilityBatch action.

       WARNING:
          Because  the batch request can result in a combination of successful
          and unsuccessful actions, you should check  for  batch  errors  even
          when the call returns an HTTP status code of 200 .

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The  URL  of  the  Amazon  SQS  queue  whose messages' visibility is
          changed.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --entries (list)
          Lists the receipt handles of the messages for which  the  visibility
          timeout must be changed.

          (structure)
              Encloses a receipt handle and an entry ID for each message in ``
              ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch .``

              Id -> (string)
                 An identifier for this particular receipt handle used to com-
                 municate the result.

                 NOTE:
                     The  Id  s  of a batch request need to be unique within a
                     request.

                     This identifier can have up to 80 characters. The follow-
                     ing characters are accepted: alphanumeric characters, hy-
                     phens(-), and underscores (_).

              ReceiptHandle -> (string)
                 A receipt handle.

              VisibilityTimeout -> (integer)
                 The new value (in seconds) for the message's visibility time-
                 out.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,ReceiptHandle=string,VisibilityTimeout=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Id": "string",
              "ReceiptHandle": "string",
              "VisibilityTimeout": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To change multiple messages' timeout visibilities as a batch

       This example changes the 2 specified messages' timeout visibilities  to
       10 hours (10 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds).

       Command:

          aws sqs change-message-visibility-batch --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyQueue --entries file://change-message-visibility-batch.json

       Input file (change-message-visibility-batch.json):

          [
            {
              "Id": "FirstMessage",
                  "ReceiptHandle": "AQEBhz2q...Jf3kaw==",
                  "VisibilityTimeout": 36000
            },
            {
              "Id": "SecondMessage",
                  "ReceiptHandle": "AQEBkTUH...HifSnw==",
                  "VisibilityTimeout": 36000
            }
          ]

       Output:

          {
            "Successful": [
              {
                "Id": "SecondMessage"
              },
              {

            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Successful -> (list)
          A list of ``  ChangeMessageVisibilityBatchResultEntry `` items.

          (structure)
              Encloses  the Id of an entry in ``  ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch
              .``

              Id -> (string)
                 Represents  a  message  whose  visibility  timeout  has  been
                 changed successfully.

       Failed -> (list)
          A list of ``  BatchResultErrorEntry `` items.

          (structure)
              Gives  a detailed description of the result of an action on each
              entry in the request.

              Id -> (string)

              SenderFault -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the error happened due to the caller of the
                 batch API action.

              Code -> (string)
                 An  error code representing why the action failed on this en-
                 try.
