DELETE-MESSAGE()                                              DELETE-MESSAGE()



NAME
       delete-message -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified message from the specified queue. To select the
       message to delete, use the ReceiptHandle of the message (not  the  Mes-
       sageId  which  you  receive  when you send the message). Amazon SQS can
       delete a message from a queue even  if  a  visibility  timeout  setting
       causes  the  message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS auto-
       matically deletes messages left in a queue longer  than  the  retention
       period configured for the queue.

       NOTE:
          The  ReceiptHandle is associated with a specific instance of receiv-
          ing a message. If you receive a message  more  than  once,  the  Re-
          ceiptHandle  is  different each time you receive a message. When you
          use the DeleteMessage action, you must provide the most recently re-
          ceived  ReceiptHandle  for  the message (otherwise, the request suc-
          ceeds, but the message might not be deleted).

          For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even  after
          you  delete  it.  This  might happen on rare occasions if one of the
          servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable  when  you
          send  the  request  to  delete  the message. The copy remains on the
          server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive  re-
          quest.  You  should  ensure  that your application is idempotent, so
          that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the Amazon SQS queue from which messages are deleted.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --receipt-handle (string)
          The receipt handle associated with the message to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
