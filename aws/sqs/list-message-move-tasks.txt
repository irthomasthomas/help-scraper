LIST-MESSAGE-MOVE-TASKS()                            LIST-MESSAGE-MOVE-TASKS()



NAME
       list-message-move-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the most recent message movement tasks (up to 10) under a specific
       source queue.

       NOTE:

          o This action is currently limited  to  supporting  message  redrive
            from  dead-letter  queues (DLQs) only. In this context, the source
            queue is the dead-letter queue (DLQ), while the destination  queue
            can  be  the  original  source queue (from which the messages were
            driven to the dead-letter-queue), or a custom destination queue.

          o Currently, only standard queues are supported.

          o Only one active message movement task is supported  per  queue  at
            any given time.

OPTIONS
       --source-arn (string)
          The ARN of the queue whose message movement tasks are to be listed.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to include in the response. The de-
          fault is 1, which provides the most recent  message  movement  task.
          The upper limit is 10.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Results -> (list)
          A list of message movement tasks and their attributes.

          (structure)
              Contains the details of a message movement task.

              TaskHandle -> (string)
                 An identifier associated with a message movement  task.  When
                 this  field  is  returned in the response of the ListMessage-
                 MoveTasks action, it is only populated for tasks that are  in
                 RUNNING status.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the message movement task. Possible values are:
                 RUNNING, COMPLETED, CANCELLING, CANCELLED, and FAILED.

              SourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the queue that contains the messages to  be  moved
                 to another queue.

              DestinationArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the destination queue if it has been specified in
                 the StartMessageMoveTask request. If a DestinationArn has not
                 been  specified  in  the  StartMessageMoveTask  request, this
                 field value will be NULL.

              MaxNumberOfMessagesPerSecond -> (integer)
                 The number of messages to be moved per  second  (the  message
                 movement rate), if it has been specified in the StartMessage-
                 MoveTask request. If a MaxNumberOfMessagesPerSecond  has  not
                 been  specified  in  the  StartMessageMoveTask  request, this
                 field value will be NULL.

              ApproximateNumberOfMessagesMoved -> (long)
                 The approximate number of messages already moved to the  des-
                 tination queue.

              ApproximateNumberOfMessagesToMove -> (long)
                 The  number  of  messages  to be moved from the source queue.
                 This number is obtained at the time of starting  the  message
                 movement task.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 The  task failure reason (only included if the task status is
                 FAILED).

              StartedTimestamp -> (long)
                 The timestamp of starting the message movement task.
