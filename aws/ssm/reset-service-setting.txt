RESET-SERVICE-SETTING()                                RESET-SERVICE-SETTING()



NAME
       reset-service-setting -

DESCRIPTION
          ServiceSetting  is  an  account-level setting for an Amazon Web Ser-
          vices service. This setting defines how a  user  interacts  with  or
          uses  a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon
          Web Services service charges money to the account based  on  feature
          or  service  usage,  then the Amazon Web Services service team might
          create a default setting of "false". This means the user  can't  use
          this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intention-
          ally opt in for a paid feature.

       Services map a SettingId object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services
       services  teams  define  the  default value for a SettingId . You can't
       create a new SettingId , but you can overwrite the default value if you
       have  the  ssm:UpdateServiceSetting permission for the setting. Use the
       GetServiceSetting API operation to view the current value. Use the  Up-
       dateServiceSetting API operation to change the default setting.

       Reset  the service setting for the account to the default value as pro-
       visioned by the Amazon Web Services service team.

OPTIONS
       --setting-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service setting to reset.  The
          setting ID can be one of the following.

          o /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-destination

          o /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-group-name

          o /ssm/documents/console/public-sharing-permission

          o /ssm/managed-instance/activation-tier

          o /ssm/opsinsights/opscenter

          o /ssm/parameter-store/default-parameter-tier

          o /ssm/parameter-store/high-throughput-enabled

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To reset the service setting for Parameter Store throughput

       The  following reset-service-setting example resets the service setting
       for Parameter Store throughput in the specified region to no longer use
       increased throughput.

          aws ssm reset-service-setting \
              --setting-id arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:123456789012:servicesetting/ssm/parameter-store/high-throughput-enabled

       Output:

          {
              "ServiceSetting": {
                  "SettingId": "/ssm/parameter-store/high-throughput-enabled",
                  "SettingValue": "false",
                  "LastModifiedDate": 1555532818.578,

              }
          }
