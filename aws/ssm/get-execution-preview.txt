NAME
       get-execution-preview -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates  the process of retrieving an existing preview that shows the

SYNOPSIS
            get-execution-preview
          --execution-preview-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]

          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

OPTIONS
       --execution-preview-id (string)
          The ID of the existing execution preview.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ExecutionPreviewId -> (string)
          The generated ID for the existing execution preview.

       EndedAt -> (timestamp)
          A  UTC  timestamp  indicating  when  the execution preview operation
          ended.

       Status -> (string)
          The current status of the execution preview operation.

       StatusMessage -> (string)
          Supplemental information about the current status of  the  execution
          preview.

       ExecutionPreview -> (tagged union structure)
          Information  about  the  changes  that would be made if an execution
          were run.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: Automation.

          Automation -> (structure)
              Information  about  the changes that would be made if an Automa-
              tion workflow were run.

              StepPreviews -> (map)
                 Information about the type of impact  a  runbook  step  would
                 have on a resource.

                 o Mutating  : The runbook step would make changes to the tar-
                   gets through actions that create,  modify,  or  delete  re-
                   sources.

                 o Non_Mutating  :  The runbook step would retrieve data about
                   resources but not make changes to them. This category  gen-
                   erally  includes  Describe*  ,  List*  , Get* , and similar
                   read-only API actions.

                 o Undetermined : An undetermined step invokes executions per-
                   formed  by  another orchestration service like Lambda, Step
                   Functions, or Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Run  Com-
                   mand.  An  undetermined  step might also call a third-party
                   API. Systems Manager Automation doesn't know the outcome of
                   the  orchestration processes or third-party API executions,
                   so the results of the steps are undetermined.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (integer)

              Regions -> (list)
                 Information about the Amazon Web Services Regions targeted by
                 the execution preview.

                 (string)

              TargetPreviews -> (list)
                 Information  that  provides  a  preview of what the impact of
                 running the specified Automation runbook would be.

                 (structure)
                     Information about the resources that would be included in
                     the actual runbook execution, if it were to be run.

                     Count -> (integer)
                        The  number of resources of a certain type included in
                        an execution preview.

                     TargetType -> (string)
                        A type of resource that was included in the  execution
                        preview.

              TotalAccounts -> (integer)
                 Information  about the Amazon Web Services accounts that were
