TERMINATE-SESSION()                                        TERMINATE-SESSION()



NAME
       terminate-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Permanently  ends  a session and closes the data connection between the
       Session Manager client and SSM Agent on the managed node. A  terminated
       session can't be resumed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            terminate-session
          --session-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --session-id (string)
          The ID of the session to terminate.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To end a Session Manager session

       This terminate-session example permanently ends a session that was cre-
       ated by the user "Shirley-Rodriguez" and closes the data connection be-
       tween the Session Manager client and SSM Agent on the instance.

          aws ssm terminate-session \
              --session-id "Shirley-Rodriguez-07a16060613c408b5"

       Output:

          {
              "SessionId": "Shirley-Rodriguez-07a16060613c408b5"
          }
