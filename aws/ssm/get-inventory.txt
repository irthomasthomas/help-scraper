GET-INVENTORY()                                                GET-INVENTORY()



NAME
       get-inventory -

DESCRIPTION
       Query inventory information. This includes managed node status, such as
       Stopped or Terminated .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-inventory is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Entities

          results.

          (structure)
              One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list
              of results.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter key.

              Values -> (list)
                 Inventory filter values. Example: inventory filter where man-
                 aged node IDs are specified as values  Key=AWS:InstanceInfor-
                 mation.InstanceId,Values=                     i-a12b3c4d5e6g,
                 i-1a2b3c4d5e6,Type=Equal .

                 (string)

                 The type of filter.

                 NOTE:
                     The Exists filter must be used with aggregators. For more
                     information, see Aggregating inventory data in the Amazon
                     Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Type": "Equal"|"NotEqual"|"BeginWith"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThan"|"Exists"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --aggregators (list)
          Returns counts of inventory types based on one or more  expressions.
          For  example,  if you aggregate by using an expression that uses the
          AWS:InstanceInformation.PlatformType type, you can see  a  count  of
          how  many  Windows and Linux managed nodes exist in your inventoried
          fleet.

          (structure)
              Specifies the inventory type and attribute for  the  aggregation
              execution.

              Expression -> (string)
                 The inventory type and attribute name for aggregation.

              Aggregators -> (list)
                 Nested  aggregators  to further refine aggregation for an in-
                 ventory type.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies the inventory type and attribute for the aggre-
                     gation execution.

                     Expression -> (string)
                        The inventory type and attribute name for aggregation.

                     Groups -> (list)
                        A  user-defined set of one or more filters on which to
                        aggregate inventory data. Groups return a count of re-
                        sources  that match and don't match the specified cri-
                        teria.

                               Filters  define the criteria for the group. The
                               matchingCount field displays the number of  re-
                               sources  that match the criteria. The notMatch-
                               ingCount field displays the number of resources
                               that don't match the criteria.

                                      tory  filter  where managed node IDs are
                                      specified as values  Key=AWS:InstanceIn-
                                      formation.InstanceId,Values=
                                      i-a12b3c4d5e6g, i-1a2b3c4d5e6,Type=Equal
                                      .

                     Filters -> (list)
                        Filters define the criteria for the group. The  match-
                        ingCount  field  displays the number of resources that
                        match the criteria. The  notMatchingCount  field  dis-
                        plays  the  number  of  resources that don't match the
                        criteria.

                        (structure)
                            One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more

       --result-attributes (list)
          The list of inventory item types to return.

          (structure)
              The inventory item result attribute.

              TypeName -> (string)
                 Name of the inventory item type. Valid value: AWS:InstanceIn-
                 formation . Default Value: AWS:InstanceInformation .

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          Collection of inventory entities such as  a  collection  of  managed
          node inventory.

          (structure)
              Inventory query results.

              Id -> (string)
                 ID  of  the inventory result entity. For example, for managed
                 node inventory the result will be the managed  node  ID.  For
                 EC2 instance inventory, the result will be the instance ID.

              Data -> (map)
                 The data section in the inventory result entity JSON.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     The inventory result item.

                     TypeName -> (string)
                        The name of the inventory result item type.

                     SchemaVersion -> (string)
                        The schema version for the inventory result item/

                     CaptureTime -> (string)
                        The time inventory item data was captured.

                     ContentHash -> (string)
                        MD5 hash of the inventory item type contents. The con-
                        tent hash is used to determine whether to  update  in-
                        ventory  information. The PutInventory API doesn't up-
                        date the inventory item type contents if the MD5  hash
                        hasn't changed since last update.

                     Content -> (list)
                        Contains  all the inventory data of the item type. Re-
                        sults include attribute names and values.

                        (map)
                            key -> (string)
