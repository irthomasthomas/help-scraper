PUT-COMPLIANCE-ITEMS()                                  PUT-COMPLIANCE-ITEMS()



NAME
       put-compliance-items -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  a  compliance  type and other compliance details on a desig-
       nated resource. This operation lets you register custom compliance  de-
       tails  with a resource. This call overwrites existing compliance infor-
       mation on the resource, so you must provide a full list  of  compliance
       items each time that you send the request.

       ComplianceType can be one of the following:

       o ExecutionId:  The execution ID when the patch, association, or custom
         compliance item was applied.

       o ExecutionType: Specify patch, association, or Custom:string .

       o ExecutionTime. The time the patch, association, or custom  compliance
         item was applied to the managed node.

       o Id: The patch, association, or custom compliance ID.

       o Title: A title.

       o Status:  The status of the compliance item. For example, approved for
         patches, or Failed for associations.

       o Severity: A patch severity. For example, Critical .

       o DocumentName: An SSM document name. For example, AWS-RunPatchBaseline
         .

       o DocumentVersion: An SSM document version number. For example, 4.

       o Classification: A patch classification. For example, security updates
         .

       o PatchBaselineId: A patch baseline ID.

       o PatchSeverity: A patch severity. For example, Critical .

       o PatchState: A patch state. For example, InstancesWithFailedPatches .

       o PatchGroup: The name of a patch group.

       o InstalledTime: The time the association, patch, or custom  compliance
         item  was applied to the resource. Specify the time by using the fol-
         lowing format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'

OPTIONS
       --resource-id (string)
          Specify an ID for this resource. For a managed  node,  this  is  the
          node ID.

       --resource-type (string)
          Specify  the type of resource. ManagedInstance is currently the only
          supported resource type.

       --compliance-type (string)
          Specify the compliance type. For example, specify Association (for a
          State Manager association), Patch, or Custom:string .

       --execution-summary (structure)
          A  summary  of the call execution that includes an execution ID, the
          type of execution (for example, Command ), and the date/time of  the
          execution  using  a  datetime  object that is saved in the following
          format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'

          ExecutionTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the execution ran as a datetime object that is saved in
              the following format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'

          ExecutionId -> (string)
              An  ID created by the system when PutComplianceItems was called.
              For example, CommandID is a valid execution ID. You can use this
              ID in subsequent calls.

          ExecutionType -> (string)
              The type of execution. For example, Command is a valid execution
              type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ExecutionTime=timestamp,ExecutionId=string,ExecutionType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ExecutionTime": timestamp,
            "ExecutionId": "string",
            "ExecutionType": "string"
          }

       --items (list)
          Information about the compliance as defined by  the  resource  type.
          For example, for a patch compliance type, Items includes information
          about the PatchSeverity, Classification, and so on.

          (structure)
              Information about a compliance item.

              Id -> (string)
                 The compliance item ID. For example, if the  compliance  item
                 is  a Windows patch, the ID could be the number of the KB ar-
                 ticle.

              Title -> (string)
                 The title of the compliance item. For example, if the compli-
                 ance item is a Windows patch, the title could be the title of
                 the KB article for the patch; for  example:  Security  Update
                 for Active Directory Federation Services.

              Severity -> (string)
                 The severity of the compliance status. Severity can be one of
                 the following: Critical, High,  Medium,  Low,  Informational,
                 Unspecified.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status of the compliance item. An item is either COMPLI-
                 ANT or NON_COMPLIANT.

              Details -> (map)
                 A "Key": "Value" tag combination for the compliance item.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,Title=string,Severity=string,Status=string,Details={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Id": "string",
              "Title": "string",
              "Severity": "CRITICAL"|"HIGH"|"MEDIUM"|"LOW"|"INFORMATIONAL"|"UNSPECIFIED",
              "Status": "COMPLIANT"|"NON_COMPLIANT",
              "Details": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --item-content-hash (string)
          MD5 or SHA-256 content hash. The content hash is used  to  determine
          if  existing  information  should  be overwritten or ignored. If the
          content hashes match, the request to put compliance  information  is
          ignored.

       --upload-type (string)
          The mode for uploading compliance items. You can specify COMPLETE or
          PARTIAL . In COMPLETE mode, the system overwrites all existing  com-
          pliance  information  for the resource. You must provide a full list
          of compliance items each time you send the request.

          In PARTIAL mode, the system overwrites compliance information for  a
          specific  association. The association must be configured with Sync-
          Compliance set to MANUAL . By default,  all  requests  use  COMPLETE
          mode.

          NOTE:
              This attribute is only valid for association compliance.

          Possible values:

          o COMPLETE

          o PARTIAL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  register  a  compliance type and compliance details to a designated
       instance

       This example registers the compliance type Custom:AVCheck to the speci-
       fied managed instance. There is no output if the command succeeds.

       Command:

          aws ssm put-compliance-items --resource-id "i-1234567890abcdef0" --resource-type "ManagedInstance" --compliance-type "Custom:AVCheck" --execution-summary "ExecutionTime=2019-02-18T16:00:00Z" --items "Id=Version2.0,Title=ScanHost,Severity=CRITICAL,Status=COMPLIANT"

OUTPUT
       None
