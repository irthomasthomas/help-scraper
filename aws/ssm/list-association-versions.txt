LIST-ASSOCIATION-VERSIONS()                        LIST-ASSOCIATION-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-association-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves all versions of an association for a specific association ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-association-versions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: AssociationVersions

OPTIONS
       --association-id (string)
          The association ID for which you want to view all versions.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  managed nodes in the Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 The cron or rate schedule specified for the association  when
                 the association version was created.

              OutputLocation -> (structure)
                 The  location in Amazon S3 specified for the association when
                 the association version was created.

                 S3Location -> (structure)
                     An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of  this
                     request.

                     OutputS3Region -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

                     OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                        The name of the S3 bucket.

                     OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                        The S3 bucket subfolder.

              AssociationName -> (string)
                 The name specified for the association version when the asso-
                 ciation version was created.

              MaxErrors -> (string)
                 The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops
                 sending  requests  to  run the association on additional tar-
                 gets. You can specify either an absolute  number  of  errors,
                 for  example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for exam-
                 ple 10%. If you specify 3,  for  example,  the  system  stops
                 sending  requests  when  the fourth error is received. If you
                 specify 0, then the system stops sending requests  after  the
                 first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 man-
                 aged nodes and set MaxError to 10%,  then  the  system  stops
                 sending the request when the sixth error is received.

                 Executions  that are already running an association when Max-
                 Errors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of  these
                 executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there
                 won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set  MaxCon-
                 currency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.

              MaxConcurrency -> (string)
                 The  maximum number of targets allowed to run the association
                 at the same time. You can specify a number, for  example  10,
                 or  a  percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The de-
                 fault value is 100%, which means all targets run the associa-
                 tion at the same time.

                 If  a new managed node starts and attempts to run an associa-
                 tion while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associa-
                 tions, the association is allowed to run. During the next as-
                 sociation interval, the new managed node will process its as-
                 sociation within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency .

              ComplianceSeverity -> (string)
                 The severity level that is assigned to the association.

              SyncCompliance -> (string)
                 The mode for generating association compliance. You can spec-
                 ify AUTO or MANUAL . In AUTO mode, the system uses the status
                 of the association execution to determine the compliance sta-
                 tus. If the association execution runs successfully, then the
                 association  is  COMPLIANT  .  If  the  association execution
                 doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT .

                 In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as  a  pa-
                 rameter  for  the   PutComplianceItems API operation. In this
                 case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a capa-
                 bility  of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed
                 by your direct call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

                 By default, all associations use AUTO mode.

              ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval -> (boolean)
                 By default, when you create a new  associations,  the  system
                 runs it immediately after it is created and then according to
                 the schedule you specified. Specify this option if you  don't
                 want  an  association to run immediately after you create it.
                 This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.

              CalendarNames -> (list)
                 The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change  Cal-
                 endar  type  documents your associations are gated under. The
                 associations for this version only run when that Change  Cal-
                 endar  is open. For more information, see Amazon Web Services
                 Systems Manager Change Calendar .

                 (string)

              TargetLocations -> (list)
                 The combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web
                 Services  accounts  where  you  wanted to run the association
                 when this association version was created.

                 (structure)
                     The combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon
                     Web  Services accounts targeted by the current Automation
                     execution.
