NAME
       describe-maintenance-window-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the tasks in a maintenance window.

       NOTE:
          For  maintenance  window tasks without a specified target, you can't
          supply values for --max-errors and --max-concurrency . Instead,  the
          system  inserts  a placeholder value of 1 , which may be reported in
          the response to this command. These values don't affect the  running
          of your task and can be ignored.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-maintenance-window-tasks  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: Tasks

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window whose tasks should be retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          Optional filters used to narrow  down  the  scope  of  the  returned
          tasks. The supported filter keys are WindowTaskId , TaskArn , Prior-
          ity , and TaskType .

          (structure)
              Filter used in the request. Supported filter keys depend on  the
              API  operation that includes the filter. API operations that use
              MaintenanceWindowFilter> include the following:

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutions

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTaskInvocations

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTasks

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindows

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTargets

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTasks

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Tasks -> (list)
          Information about the tasks in the maintenance window.

          (structure)
              Information about a task defined for a maintenance window.

              WindowId -> (string)
                 The ID of the maintenance window where  the  task  is  regis-
                 tered.

              WindowTaskId -> (string)
                 The task ID.

              TaskArn -> (string)
                 The  resource  that  the  task  uses  during  execution.  For
                 RUN_COMMAND and AUTOMATION task types, TaskArn is the  Amazon
                 Web  Services Systems Manager (SSM document) name or ARN. For
                 LAMBDA tasks, it's the function name or ARN.  For  STEP_FUNC-
                 TIONS tasks, it's the state machine ARN.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For  example,
                        if  you  specified  tag:ServerRole , you could specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values for a key might be lower than the global  maxi-
                        mum of 50.

              TaskParameters -> (map)
                 The  parameters  that should be passed to the task when it is
                 run.

                 NOTE:
                     TaskParameters has been deprecated. To specify parameters
                     to  pass  to a task when it runs, instead use the Parame-
                     ters option in  the  TaskInvocationParameters  structure.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The priority of the task in the maintenance window. The lower
                 the number, the higher the priority. Tasks that have the same
                 priority are scheduled in parallel.

              LoggingInfo -> (structure)
                 Information about an S3 bucket to write task-level logs to.

                 NOTE:
                     LoggingInfo has been deprecated.  To  specify  an  Amazon
                     Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)  bucket to contain
                     logs,  instead  use  the  OutputS3BucketName   and   Out-
                     putS3KeyPrefix  options  in  the TaskInvocationParameters
                     structure. For information about how Amazon Web  Services
                     Systems  Manager  handles these options for the supported
                     maintenance window task  types,  see   MaintenanceWindow-
                     TaskInvocationParameters .

                 S3BucketName -> (string)

                 S3Region -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services Region where the S3 bucket is lo-
                     cated.

              ServiceRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  service  role  for
                 Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager to assume when running a
                 maintenance window task. If you do not specify a service role
                 ARN,  Systems  Manager uses a service-linked role in your ac-
                 count. If no appropriate service-linked role for Systems Man-
                 ager  exists in your account, it is created when you run Reg-
                 isterTaskWithMaintenanceWindow .

                 However, for an improved security posture, we strongly recom-
                 mend  creating  a  custom  policy and custom service role for
                 running your maintenance window  tasks.  The  policy  can  be
                 crafted  to provide only the permissions needed for your par-
                 ticular maintenance window tasks. For more  information,  see
                 Setting  up Maintenance Windows in the in the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

              MaxConcurrency -> (string)
                 The maximum number of targets this task can be  run  for,  in
                 parallel.

                 NOTE:
                     Although  this  element  is  listed  as "Required: No", a

                     dating  a targetless task You must provide a value in all
                     other cases.

                     For maintenance window tasks without a target  specified,
                     you  can't  supply  a value for this option. Instead, the
                     system inserts a placeholder value  of  1  .  This  value
                     doesn't affect the running of your task.

              MaxErrors -> (string)
                 The  maximum  number of errors allowed before this task stops
                 being scheduled.

                 NOTE:
                     Although this element is  listed  as  "Required:  No",  a
                     value can be omitted only when you are registering or up-
                     dating a targetless task You must provide a value in  all
                     other cases.

                     For  maintenance window tasks without a target specified,
                     you can't supply a value for this  option.  Instead,  the
                     system  inserts  a  placeholder  value  of 1 . This value
                     doesn't affect the running of your task.

                 IgnorePollAlarmFailure -> (boolean)
                     When this value is true , your automation or command con-
                     tinues to run in cases where we cant retrieve alarm  sta-
                     tus  information  from CloudWatch. In cases where we suc-
                     cessfully retrieve an alarm  status  of  OK  or  INSUFFI-
                     CIENT_DATA,  the  automation or command continues to run,
                     regardless of this value. Default is false .
