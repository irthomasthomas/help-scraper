CREATE-RESOURCE-DATA-SYNC()                        CREATE-RESOURCE-DATA-SYNC()



NAME
       create-resource-data-sync -

DESCRIPTION
       A  resource  data  sync  helps you view data from multiple sources in a
       single location. Amazon Web Services Systems Manager offers  two  types
       of resource data sync: SyncToDestination and SyncFromSource .

       You  can  configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the SyncToDestina-
       tion type to synchronize Inventory data from multiple Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  Regions  to  a  single Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
       bucket. For more information, see Configuring resource  data  sync  for
       Inventory in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       You  can  configure  Systems Manager Explorer to use the SyncFromSource
       type to synchronize operational work items (OpsItems)  and  operational
       data  (OpsData)  from  multiple Amazon Web Services Regions to a single
       Amazon S3 bucket. This type can synchronize OpsItems and  OpsData  from
       multiple  Amazon  Web Services accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions
       or EntireOrganization by using Organizations. For more information, see
       Setting  up  Systems Manager Explorer to display data from multiple ac-
       counts and Regions in the Amazon  Web  Services  Systems  Manager  User
       Guide .

       A  resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immedi-
       ately. After a successful initial sync is completed, the system contin-
       uously  syncs  data.  To  check  the status of a sync, use the  ListRe-
       sourceDataSync .

       NOTE:
          By default, data isn't encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend
          that  you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data stor-
          age. We also recommend that you  secure  access  to  the  Amazon  S3
          bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy.

       --sync-type (string)
          Specify SyncToDestination to create a resource data sync  that  syn-
          chronizes  data  to an S3 bucket for Inventory. If you specify Sync-
          ToDestination , you must provide a value for S3Destination . Specify
          SyncFromSource  to synchronize data from a single account and multi-
          ple Regions, or multiple Amazon Web Services accounts and Amazon Web
          Services  Regions,  as  listed in Organizations for Explorer. If you
          specify SyncFromSource , you must provide a value for  SyncSource  .
          The default value is SyncToDestination .

       --sync-source (structure)
          Specify  information about the data sources to synchronize. This pa-
          rameter is required if the SyncType value is SyncFromSource.

                 If an Amazon Web Services organization is  present,  this  is
                 either  OrganizationalUnits or EntireOrganization . For Orga-
                 nizationalUnits , the data is aggregated from a set of  orga-
                 nization  units.  For EntireOrganization , the data is aggre-
                 gated from the entire Amazon Web Services organization.

              Amazon Web Services Regions when those Regions come online.

          EnableAllOpsDataSources -> (boolean)
              When  you  create a resource data sync, if you choose one of the
              Organizations options, then Systems  Manager  automatically  en-
              ables  all  OpsData  sources in the selected Amazon Web Services
              Regions for all Amazon Web Services accounts in  your  organiza-
              tion  (or in the selected organization units). For more informa-
              tion, see About multiple account and Region resource data  syncs

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
