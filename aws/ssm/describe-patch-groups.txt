DESCRIBE-PATCH-GROUPS()                                DESCRIBE-PATCH-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-patch-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all patch groups that have been registered with patch baselines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-patch-groups  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Mappings

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Each element in the array is  a  structure  containing  a  key-value
          pair.

          Supported keys for DescribePatchGroups include the following:

          o

            **
            NAME_PREFIX **   Sample values: AWS- | My- .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 76)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          o

            **
            OPERATING_SYSTEM **   Sample values: AMAZON_LINUX | SUSE | WINDOWS

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 78)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          (structure)
              Defines  a  filter  used in Patch Manager APIs. Supported filter
              keys depend on the API operation that includes the filter. Patch
              Manager  API operations that use PatchOrchestratorFilter include
              the following:

              o DescribeAvailablePatches

              o DescribeInstancePatches

              o DescribePatchBaselines

              o DescribePatchGroups

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value for the filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       line in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Mappings -> (list)
          Each entry in the array contains:

          o PatchGroup   :  string  (between  1  and  256  characters.  Regex:
            ^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$)

          o PatchBaselineIdentity : A PatchBaselineIdentity element.

          (structure)
              The mapping between a patch group and  the  patch  baseline  the
              patch group is registered with.

              PatchGroup -> (string)
                 The  name  of the patch group registered with the patch base-
                 line.

              BaselineIdentity -> (structure)
                 The patch baseline the patch group is registered with.

                 BaselineId -> (string)
                     The ID of the patch baseline.

                 BaselineName -> (string)
                     The name of the patch baseline.

                 OperatingSystem -> (string)
                     Defines the operating system the patch  baseline  applies
                     to. The default value is WINDOWS .

                 BaselineDescription -> (string)
                     The description of the patch baseline.

                 DefaultBaseline -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  this  is the default baseline. Amazon
                     Web Services Systems Manager supports  creating  multiple
                     default  patch  baselines.  For example, you can create a
                     default patch baseline for each operating system.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use when requesting the next set of items. If there are
          no additional items to return, the string is empty.
