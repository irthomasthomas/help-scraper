UPDATE-SERVICE-SETTING()                              UPDATE-SERVICE-SETTING()



NAME
       update-service-setting -

DESCRIPTION
          ServiceSetting  is  an  account-level setting for an Amazon Web Ser-
          vices service. This setting defines how a  user  interacts  with  or
          uses  a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon
          Web Services service charges money to the account based  on  feature
          or  service  usage,  then the Amazon Web Services service team might
          create a default setting of "false". This means the user  can't  use
          this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intention-
          ally opt in for a paid feature.

       Services map a SettingId object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services
       services  teams  define  the  default value for a SettingId . You can't
       create a new SettingId , but you can overwrite the default value if you
       have  the  ssm:UpdateServiceSetting permission for the setting. Use the
       GetServiceSetting API operation to view the current value. Or, use  the
       ResetServiceSetting  to change the value back to the original value de-
       fined by the Amazon Web Services service team.

       Update the service setting for the account.

SYNOPSIS
            update-service-setting
          --setting-id <value>
          --setting-value <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --setting-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service setting to reset.  For
          example,   arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:111122223333:servicesetting/ssm/pa-
          rameter-store/high-throughput-enabled . The setting ID can be one of
          the following.

          o /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-destination

          o /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-group-name

          o /ssm/documents/console/public-sharing-permission

          o /ssm/managed-instance/activation-tier

          o /ssm/opsinsights/opscenter

          o /ssm/parameter-store/default-parameter-tier

          o /ssm/parameter-store/high-throughput-enabled

       --setting-value (string)
          The new value to specify for the service setting. The following list
          specifies the available values for each setting.

          o /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-destination : CloudWatch

          o /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-group-name : the  name  of  an
            Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group

          o /ssm/documents/console/public-sharing-permission  : Enable or Dis-
            able

          o /ssm/managed-instance/activation-tier : standard or advanced

          o /ssm/opsinsights/opscenter : Enabled or Disabled

          o /ssm/parameter-store/default-parameter-tier : Standard ,  Advanced
            , Intelligent-Tiering

          o /ssm/parameter-store/high-throughput-enabled : true or false

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update the service setting for Parameter Store throughput

       The  following  update-service-setting example updates the current ser-
       vice setting for Parameter Store throughput in the specified region  to
       use increased throughput.

          aws ssm update-service-setting \
              --setting-id arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:123456789012:servicesetting/ssm/parameter-store/high-throughput-enabled \
              --setting-value true

       This command produces no output.

       For  more information, see Increasing Parameter Store Throughput in the
       AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
