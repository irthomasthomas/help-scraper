NAME
       update-maintenance-window-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a task assigned to a maintenance window. You can't change the
       task type, but you can change the following values:

       o TaskARN . For  example,  you  can  change  a  RUN_COMMAND  task  from
         AWS-RunPowerShellScript to AWS-RunShellScript .

       o ServiceRoleArn

       o TaskInvocationParameters

       o Priority

       o MaxConcurrency

       o MaxErrors

       NOTE:
          One  or  more  targets  must be specified for maintenance window Run
          Command-type tasks. Depending on the task, targets are optional  for
          other  maintenance  window  task types (Automation, Lambda, and Step
          Functions). For more information  about  running  tasks  that  don't
          specify  targets,  see  Registering maintenance window tasks without
          targets in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       If the value for a parameter in  UpdateMaintenanceWindowTask  is  null,
       then  the  corresponding  field  isn't  modified. If you set Replace to
       true, then all fields required by the   RegisterTaskWithMaintenanceWin-
       dow  operation  are  required  for  this  request. Optional fields that
       aren't specified are set to null.

       WARNING:
          When you update a maintenance window task that has options specified
          in TaskInvocationParameters , you must provide again all the TaskIn-
          vocationParameters values that you want to retain.  The  values  you
          don't  specify again are removed. For example, suppose that when you
          registered a Run Command task, you  specified  TaskInvocationParame-
          ters  values  for Comment , NotificationConfig , and OutputS3Bucket-
          Name . If you update the maintenance window task and specify only  a
          different OutputS3BucketName value, the values for Comment and Noti-
          ficationConfig are removed.

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The maintenance window ID that contains the task to modify.

       --window-task-id (string)
          The task ID to modify.

       --targets (list)
          The targets (either managed nodes or tags) to modify. Managed  nodes
          are   specified   using  the  format  Key=instanceids,Values=instan-
          ceID_1,instanceID_2  .  Tags  are   specified   using   the   format
          Key=tag_name,Values=tag_value .

          NOTE:
              One or more targets must be specified for maintenance window Run
              Command-type tasks. Depending on the task, targets are  optional
              for other maintenance window task types (Automation, Lambda, and
              Step Functions). For more information about running  tasks  that
              don't  specify targets, see Registering maintenance window tasks
              without targets in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager  User
              Guide .

          (structure)
              An  array  of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a
              key-value pair that you specify.

              NOTE:
                 One or more targets must be specified for maintenance  window
                 Run  Command-type  tasks.  Depending on the task, targets are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda,  and Step Functions). For more information about run-
                 ning tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering  main-
                 tenance  window  tasks without targets in the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

                o Key=InstanceIds,Values=*

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged  nodes  using  Key,Value parameters, see Targeting multiple
              managed nodes in the Amazon Web Services  Systems  Manager  User
              Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined  criteria  for sending commands that target man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For example, if  you
                 specified  tag:ServerRole , you could specify value:WebServer
                 to run a command  on  instances  that  include  EC2  tags  of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --task-arn (string)
          The task ARN to modify.

       --service-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service  role  for  Amazon
          Web  Services  Systems  Manager to assume when running a maintenance
          window task. If you do not specify a service role ARN, Systems  Man-
          ager  uses  a service-linked role in your account. If no appropriate
          service-linked role for Systems Manager exists in your  account,  it
          is created when you run RegisterTaskWithMaintenanceWindow .

          However,  for  an  improved  security posture, we strongly recommend
          creating a custom policy and custom service role  for  running  your
          maintenance  window tasks. The policy can be crafted to provide only
          the permissions needed for your particular maintenance window tasks.
          For  more  information, see Setting up maintenance windows in the in
          the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       --task-parameters (map)
          The parameters to modify.

          NOTE:
              TaskParameters has been deprecated.  To  specify  parameters  to
              pass  to  a task when it runs, instead use the Parameters option
              in the TaskInvocationParameters structure. For information about
              how  Systems  Manager  handles  these  options for the supported
              maintenance window task types, see  MaintenanceWindowTaskInvoca-
              tionParameters .

          The map has the following format:

          Key: string, between 1 and 255 characters

          Value: an array of strings, each string is between 1 and 255 charac-
          ters

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Defines the values for a task parameter.

              Values -> (list)
                 This field contains an array of 0 or more strings, each 1  to
                 255 characters in length.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=Values=string,string,KeyName2=Values=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "Values": ["string", ...]
              }
            ...}

       --task-invocation-parameters (structure)
          The  parameters  that the task should use during execution. Populate
          only the fields that match the task type. All other fields should be
          empty.

          WARNING:
              When you update a maintenance window task that has options spec-
              ified in TaskInvocationParameters , you must provide  again  all
              the TaskInvocationParameters values that you want to retain. The
              values you don't specify again are removed. For example, suppose
              that when you registered a Run Command task, you specified Task-
              InvocationParameters values for Comment ,  NotificationConfig  ,
              and  OutputS3BucketName  .  If you update the maintenance window
              task and specify only a different OutputS3BucketName value,  the
              values for Comment and NotificationConfig are removed.

          RunCommand -> (structure)
              The parameters for a RUN_COMMAND task type.

              Comment -> (string)
                 Information about the commands to run.

              CloudWatchOutputConfig -> (structure)
                 Configuration  options  for  sending command output to Amazon
                 CloudWatch Logs.

                 CloudWatchLogGroupName -> (string)
                     The name of the CloudWatch Logs log group where you  want
                     to  send  command  output.  If  you don't specify a group
                     name, Amazon Web Services Systems  Manager  automatically
                     creates  a log group for you. The log group uses the fol-
                     lowing naming format:

                        ``
                        aws/ssm/SystemsManagerDocumentName ``

                        System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 444)
                               Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 CloudWatchOutputEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Enables Systems Manager to send command output to  Cloud-
                     Watch Logs.

              DocumentHash -> (string)
                 The SHA-256 or SHA-1 hash created by the system when the doc-
                 ument was created. SHA-1 hashes have been deprecated.

              DocumentHashType -> (string)
                 SHA-256 or SHA-1. SHA-1 hashes have been deprecated.

              DocumentVersion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document  (SSM  docu-
                 ment) version to use in the request. You can specify $DEFAULT
                 , $LATEST , or a specific version number. If you run commands
                 by  using  the  Amazon Web Services CLI, then you must escape
                 the first two options by using a backslash. If you specify  a
                 version number, then you don't need to use the backslash. For
                 example:
                     --document-version "\$DEFAULT"

                     --document-version "\$LATEST"

                     --document-version "3"

                     An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an Amazon Simple Noti-
                     fication Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Run  Command  pushes
                     notifications about command status changes to this topic.

                 NotificationEvents -> (list)
                     The  different events for which you can receive notifica-
                     tions. To learn more about these events,  see  Monitoring
                     Systems Manager status changes using Amazon SNS notifica-
                     tions in the Amazon Web  Services  Systems  Manager  User

                 NOTE:
                        LoggingInfo has been deprecated. To specify an  Amazon
                        Simple  Storage  Service (Amazon S3) bucket to contain
                        logs, instead  use  the  OutputS3BucketName  and  Out-
                        putS3KeyPrefix options in the TaskInvocationParameters
                        structure. For information about how Amazon  Web  Ser-
                        vices  Systems  Manager  handles these options for the
                        supported maintenance window task types, see   Mainte-
                        nanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters .

                        TaskParameters has been deprecated. To specify parame-
                        ters to pass to a task when it runs, instead  use  the
                        Parameters   option  in  the  TaskInvocationParameters
                        structure. For information about how  Systems  Manager
                        handles  these  options  for the supported maintenance
                        window task types,  see   MaintenanceWindowTaskInvoca-
                        tionParameters .

                     For  AUTOMATION  task  types, Amazon Web Services Systems
                     Manager ignores any values specified  for  these  parame-
                     ters.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)
                     (string)

          StepFunctions -> (structure)
              The parameters for a STEP_FUNCTIONS task type.

              Input -> (string)
                 The inputs for the STEP_FUNCTIONS task.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the STEP_FUNCTIONS task.

          Lambda -> (structure)
              The parameters for a LAMBDA task type.

              ClientContext -> (string)
                 Pass  client-specific information to the Lambda function that
                 you are invoking. You can then process the client information
                 in  your  Lambda  function  as you choose through the context
                 variable.

              Qualifier -> (string)
                 (Optional) Specify an Lambda function version or alias  name.
                 If  you  specify  a  function version, the operation uses the
                 qualified function Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  to  invoke  a
                 specific  Lambda  function. If you specify an alias name, the
                 operation uses the alias ARN to invoke  the  Lambda  function
                 version to which the alias points.

              Payload -> (blob)
                 JSON to provide to your Lambda function as input.

              For  maintenance  window  tasks  without a target specified, you
              can't supply a value for this option. Instead,  the  system  in-
              serts  a  placeholder value of 1 . This value doesn't affect the
              running of your task.

       --max-errors (string)
          The new MaxErrors value to specify. MaxErrors is the maximum  number
          of errors that are allowed before the task stops being scheduled.

              running of your task.

       --logging-info (structure)
          The new logging location in Amazon S3 to specify.

          NOTE:
              LoggingInfo has been deprecated. To  specify  an  Amazon  Simple
              Storage  Service (Amazon S3) bucket to contain logs, instead use
              the OutputS3BucketName  and  OutputS3KeyPrefix  options  in  the
              TaskInvocationParameters  structure.  For  information about how
              Amazon Web Services Systems Manager handles  these  options  for
              the  supported  maintenance  window  task  types,  see   Mainte-
              nanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters .

          S3BucketName -> (string)
              The name of an S3 bucket where execution logs are stored.

            are running continue. The default value.

          o CANCEL_TASK :

            o For Automation, Lambda, Step Functions tasks:  When  the  cutoff
              time  is  reached, any task invocations that are already running
              continue, but no new task invocations are started.

            o For Run Command tasks: When the cutoff time is reached, the sys-
              tem sends a  CancelCommand operation that attempts to cancel the
              command associated with the task. However, there is no guarantee
              that  the  command will be terminated and the underlying process
              stopped.

          The status for tasks that are not completed is TIMED_OUT .

          Possible values:

          o CONTINUE_TASK

          o CANCEL_TASK

       --alarm-configuration (structure)

              alarm status of OK or INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the automation or  com-
              mand  continues  to  run,  regardless  of this value. Default is
              false .

          Alarms -> (list)
              The name of the CloudWatch alarm specified in the configuration.

              (structure)

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

                     The  name of the CloudWatch Logs log group where you want
                     to send command output. If  you  don't  specify  a  group
                     name,  Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager automatically
                     creates a log group for you. The log group uses the  fol-

                 qualified  function  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) to invoke a
                 specific Lambda function. If you specify an alias  name,  the
                 operation  uses  the  alias ARN to invoke the Lambda function
                 version to which the alias points.

              to  run in cases where we cant retrieve alarm status information
              from CloudWatch. In cases  where  we  successfully  retrieve  an
              alarm  status of OK or INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the automation or com-
              mand continues to run, regardless  of  this  value.  Default  is
              false .
