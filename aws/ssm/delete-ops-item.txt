DELETE-OPS-ITEM()                                            DELETE-OPS-ITEM()



NAME
       delete-ops-item -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete an OpsItem. You must have permission in Identity and Access Man-
       agement (IAM) to delete an OpsItem.

       WARNING:
          Note the following important information about this operation.

          o Deleting an OpsItem is irreversible. You can't restore  a  deleted
            OpsItem.

          o This  operation  uses  an eventual consistency model , which means
            the system can take a few minutes to complete this  operation.  If
            you  delete  an OpsItem and immediately call, for example,  GetOp-
            sItem , the deleted OpsItem might still appear in the response.

          o This operation is idempotent. The system doesn't throw  an  excep-
            tion  if  you repeatedly call this operation for the same OpsItem.
            If the first call is successful, all additional calls  return  the
            same successful response as the first call.

          o This  operation  doesn't  support cross-account calls. A delegated
            administrator or management account can't delete OpsItems in other
            accounts,  even if OpsCenter has been set up for cross-account ad-
            ministration. For more information about cross-account administra-
            tion, see Setting up OpsCenter to centrally manage OpsItems across
            accounts in the Systems Manager User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --ops-item-id (string)
          The ID of the OpsItem that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       rides config/env settings.
