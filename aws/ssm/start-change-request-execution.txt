OPTIONS
       --scheduled-time (timestamp)
          The date and time specified in the change request to run the Automa-
          tion runbooks.

          NOTE:
              The Automation runbooks specified for the runbook workflow can't
              run  until  all  required  approvals for the change request have
              been received.

       --document-name (string)
          The name of the change template document to run during  the  runbook
          workflow.

       --document-version (string)
          The  version  of the change template document to run during the run-
          book workflow.

       --parameters (map)
          A key-value map of parameters that match the declared parameters  in
          the change template document.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --change-request-name (string)
          The  name of the change request associated with the runbook workflow
          to be run.

       --client-token (string)
          The user-provided idempotency token. The token must  be  unique,  is
          case insensitive, enforces the UUID format, and can't be reused.

       --auto-approve | --no-auto-approve (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the change request can be approved automatically
          without the need for manual approvals.

          If AutoApprovable is enabled in a change template, then setting  Au-
          toApprove  to  true  in StartChangeRequestExecution creates a change
          request that bypasses approver review.

          NOTE:
              Change Calendar restrictions are not bypassed in this  scenario.
              If the state of an associated calendar is CLOSED , change freeze
              approvers must still grant permission for this change request to
              run. If they don't, the change won't be processed until the cal-
              endar state is again OPEN .

       --runbooks (list)
          Information about the Automation runbooks that are  run  during  the
          runbook workflow.

          NOTE:
              The Automation runbooks specified for the runbook workflow can't
              run until all required approvals for  the  change  request  have
              been received.

                            For more information about how  to  send  commands
                            that  target managed nodes using Key,Value parame-
                            ters, see Targeting multiple managed nodes in  the
                            Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

                            Key -> (string)
                               User-defined criteria for sending commands that
                               target managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                            Values -> (list)
                               User-defined criteria that maps to  Key  .  For
                               example,  if you specified tag:ServerRole , you
                               could specify value:WebServer to run a  command
                               on  instances  that include EC2 tags of Server-
                               Role,WebServer .

                               Depending on the type of  target,  the  maximum
                               number  of values for a key might be lower than
                               the global maximum of 50.

                               (string)

                     TargetsMaxConcurrency -> (string)
                        The maximum number of targets allowed to run this task
                        in  parallel.  This TargetsMaxConcurrency takes prece-
                        dence over the StartAutomationExecution:MaxConcurrency
                        parameter if both are supplied.

                     TargetsMaxErrors -> (string)
                        The  maximum  number of errors that are allowed before
                        the system stops running the automation on  additional
                        targets.  This TargetsMaxErrors parameter takes prece-
                        dence over the StartAutomationExecution:MaxErrors  pa-
                        rameter if both are supplied.

       --tags (list)
          Optional  metadata  that you assign to a resource. You can specify a
          maximum of five tags for a change request. Tags enable you to  cate-
          gorize  a  resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or
          environment. For example, you might want to tag a change request  to
          identify  an  environment  or  target Amazon Web Services Region. In
          this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:

          o Key=Environment,Value=Production

          o Key=Region,Value=us-east-2

          (structure)
              Metadata that you assign to your Amazon Web Services  resources.
              Tags  enable you to categorize your resources in different ways,
              for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.  In  Amazon  Web
              Services  Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems Manager
              documents (SSM documents), managed nodes,  maintenance  windows,
              parameters, patch baselines, OpsItems, and OpsMetadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --scheduled-end-time (timestamp)
          The  time that the requester expects the runbook workflow related to
          the change request to complete. The time is an  estimate  only  that
          the requester provides for reviewers.

       --change-details (string)
          User-provided  details about the change. If no details are provided,
          content specified in the Template information section of the associ-
          ated change template is added.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To start a change request

       The following start-change-request-execution example  starts  a  change
       request with minimal options specified.

          aws ssm start-change-request-execution \
              --change-request-name MyChangeRequest \
              --document-name AWS-HelloWorldChangeTemplate \
              --runbooks '[{"DocumentName": "AWS-HelloWorld","Parameters": {"AutomationAssumeRole": ["arn:aws:iam:us-east-2:1112223233444:role/MyChangeManagerAssumeRole"]}}]' \
              --parameters Approver="JohnDoe",ApproverType="IamUser",ApproverSnsTopicArn="arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:1112223233444:MyNotificationTopic"

       Output:

          }

       Example 2: To start a change request using an external JSON file

       The  following  start-automation-execution  example starts a change re-
       quest with multiple options specified in a JSON file.

          aws ssm start-change-request-execution \
              --cli-input-json file://MyChangeRequest.json
