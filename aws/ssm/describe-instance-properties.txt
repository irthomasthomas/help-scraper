DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-PROPERTIES()                  DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-PROPERTIES()



NAME
       describe-instance-properties -

DESCRIPTION
       An  API operation used by the Systems Manager console to display infor-
       mation about Systems Manager managed nodes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-instance-properties is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: InstanceProperties

OPTIONS
       --instance-property-filter-list (list)
          An array of instance property filters.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for a specific list of managed nodes. You can
              filter node information by using tags. You specify tags by using
              a key-value mapping.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              valueSet -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,valueSet=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InstanceIds"|"AgentVersion"|"PingStatus"|"PlatformTypes"|"DocumentName"|"ActivationIds"|"IamRole"|"ResourceType"|"AssociationStatus",
              "valueSet": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filters-with-operator (list)
          The request filters to use with the operator.

          (structure)
              The  filters  to  describe or get information about your managed
              nodes.

              Key -> (string)
                 The filter key name to describe your managed nodes.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter key name to describe your managed nodes.

                 (string)

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator used by the filter call.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Operator": "Equal"|"NotEqual"|"BeginWith"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThan"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
