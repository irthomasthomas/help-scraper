OPTIONS
       --baseline-id (string)
          The ID of the patch baseline to update.

       --name (string)
          The name of the patch baseline.

       --global-filters (structure)
          A set of global filters used to include patches in the baseline.

          PatchFilters -> (list)
              The set of patch filters that make up the group.

              (structure)
                 Defines which patches should be included in a patch baseline.

                 A  patch  filter  consists  of a key and a set of values. The
                 filter key is a patch property. For  example,  the  available
                 filter  keys  for  WINDOWS  are  PATCH_SET  , PRODUCT , PROD-
                 UCT_FAMILY , CLASSIFICATION , and MSRC_SEVERITY .

                 The filter values define a matching criterion for  the  patch
                 property indicated by the key. For example, if the filter key
                 is PRODUCT and the filter values are ["Office 2013",  "Office
                 2016"]  ,  then  the filter accepts all patches where product
                 name is either "Office 2013" or  "Office  2016".  The  filter
                 values  can be exact values for the patch property given as a
                 key, or a wildcard (*), which matches all values.

                 You can view lists of valid values for the  patch  properties
                 by  running the DescribePatchProperties command. For informa-
                 tion about which patch properties can be used with each major
                 operating system, see  DescribePatchProperties .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key for the filter.

                     Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of
                     valid keys for each operating system type.

                 Values -> (list)
                     The value for the filter key.

                     Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of
                     valid values for each key based on operating system type.

                     (string)

              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --approval-rules (structure)
          A set of rules used to include patches in the baseline.

          PatchRules -> (list)
              The rules that make up the rule group.

              (structure)
                 Defines an approval rule for a patch baseline.

                 PatchFilterGroup -> (structure)
                     The  patch filter group that defines the criteria for the
                     rule.

                     PatchFilters -> (list)
                        The set of patch filters that make up the group.

                        (structure)
                            Defines which patches  should  be  included  in  a
                            patch baseline.

                            A patch filter consists of a key and a set of val-
                            ues. The filter key is a patch property. For exam-
                            ple,  the  available  filter  keys for WINDOWS are
                            PATCH_SET , PRODUCT , PRODUCT_FAMILY , CLASSIFICA-
                            TION , and MSRC_SEVERITY .

                            The  filter values define a matching criterion for
                            the patch property indicated by the key. For exam-
                            ple,  if  the filter key is PRODUCT and the filter
                            values are ["Office 2013", "Office 2016"]  ,  then
                            the  filter accepts all patches where product name
                            is either "Office 2013" or "Office 2016". The fil-
                            ter values can be exact values for the patch prop-
                            erty given as a key,  or  a  wildcard  (*),  which
                            matches all values.

                            You  can  view lists of valid values for the patch
                            properties by running the  DescribePatchProperties
                            command. For information about which patch proper-
                            ties can be used with each major operating system,
                            see  DescribePatchProperties .

                            Key -> (string)
                               The key for the filter.

                               Run  the   DescribePatchProperties  command  to
                               view lists of valid  keys  for  each  operating
                               system type.

                            Values -> (list)
                               The value for the filter key.

                               Run  the   DescribePatchProperties  command  to
                               view lists of valid values for each  key  based
                               on operating system type.

                               (string)

                 ComplianceLevel -> (string)
                     A compliance severity level for all approved patches in a
                     patch baseline.

                 ApproveAfterDays -> (integer)
                     The number of days after the release date of  each  patch
                     matched  by the rule that the patch is marked as approved
                     in the patch baseline. For example, a value  of  7  means
                     that  patches  are approved seven days after they are re-
                     leased.

                     This parameter is marked as Required: No , but  your  re-
                     quest must include a value for either ApproveAfterDays or
                     ApproveUntilDate .

                     WARNING:
                        Use caution when setting this value for Windows Server
                        patch  baselines.  Because  patch updates that are re-
                        placed by later updates are removed, setting too broad
                        a  value  for  this  parameter  can  result in crucial
                        patches not being installed. For more information, see

       --rejected-patches-action (string)
          The action for Patch Manager to take on patches included in the  Re-
          jectedPackages list.
                 ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY

              Linux  and macOS : A package in the rejected patches list is in-
              stalled only if it is a dependency of  another  package.  It  is
              considered  compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is
              reported as INSTALLED_OTHER . This is the default action  if  no
              option is specified.

              Windows  Server  : Windows Server doesn't support the concept of
              package dependencies. If a package in the rejected patches  list
              and already installed on the node, its status is reported as IN-
              STALLED_OTHER . Any package not already installed on the node is
              skipped. This is the default action if no option is specified.
                 BLOCK

              All  OSs  :  Packages in the rejected patches list, and packages
              that include them as dependencies,  aren't  installed  by  Patch
              Manager  under any circumstances. If a package was installed be-
              fore it was added to the rejected patches list, or is  installed
              outside of Patch Manager afterward, it's considered noncompliant
              with the patch baseline  and  its  status  is  reported  as  IN-
              STALLED_REJECTED .

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY

          o BLOCK

       --description (string)

       --replace | --no-replace (boolean)
          If  True, then all fields that are required by the  CreatePatchBase-
          line operation are also required  for  this  API  request.  Optional
          fields that aren't specified are set to null.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       guide/patch-baseline-update-or-delete.html>`__  in the AWS Systems Man-
       ager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       BaselineId -> (string)
          The ID of the deleted patch baseline.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the patch baseline.

       OperatingSystem -> (string)
          The operating system rule used by the updated patch baseline.

       GlobalFilters -> (structure)
          A set of global filters used to exclude patches from the baseline.

          PatchFilters -> (list)
              The set of patch filters that make up the group.

              (structure)
                 Defines which patches should be included in a patch baseline.

                 A patch filter consists of a key and a  set  of  values.  The
                 filter  key  is  a patch property. For example, the available
                 filter keys for WINDOWS  are  PATCH_SET  ,  PRODUCT  ,  PROD-
                 UCT_FAMILY , CLASSIFICATION , and MSRC_SEVERITY .

                 The  filter  values define a matching criterion for the patch
                 property indicated by the key. For example, if the filter key
                 is  PRODUCT and the filter values are ["Office 2013", "Office
                 2016"] , then the filter accepts all  patches  where  product
                 name  is  either  "Office  2013" or "Office 2016". The filter
                 values can be exact values for the patch property given as  a
                 key, or a wildcard (*), which matches all values.

                 You  can  view lists of valid values for the patch properties
                 by running the DescribePatchProperties command. For  informa-
                 tion about which patch properties can be used with each major
                 operating system, see  DescribePatchProperties .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key for the filter.

                     Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of
                     valid keys for each operating system type.

                 Values -> (list)
                     The value for the filter key.

                     Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of
                     valid values for each key based on operating system type.

                     (string)

       ApprovalRules -> (structure)
          A set of rules used to include patches in the baseline.

          PatchRules -> (list)
              The rules that make up the rule group.

              (structure)
                 Defines an approval rule for a patch baseline.

                 PatchFilterGroup -> (structure)
                     The patch filter group that defines the criteria for  the
                     rule.

                     PatchFilters -> (list)
                        The set of patch filters that make up the group.

                        (structure)
                            Defines  which  patches  should  be  included in a
                            patch baseline.

                            A patch filter consists of a key and a set of val-
                            ues. The filter key is a patch property. For exam-
                            ple, the available filter  keys  for  WINDOWS  are
                            PATCH_SET , PRODUCT , PRODUCT_FAMILY , CLASSIFICA-
                            TION , and MSRC_SEVERITY .

                            The filter values define a matching criterion  for
                            the patch property indicated by the key. For exam-
                            ple, if the filter key is PRODUCT and  the  filter
                            values  are  ["Office 2013", "Office 2016"] , then
                            the filter accepts all patches where product  name
                            is either "Office 2013" or "Office 2016". The fil-
                            ter values can be exact values for the patch prop-
                            erty  given  as  a  key,  or a wildcard (*), which
                            matches all values.

                            You can view lists of valid values for  the  patch
                            properties  by running the DescribePatchProperties
                            command. For information about which patch proper-
                            ties can be used with each major operating system,
                            see  DescribePatchProperties .

                            Key -> (string)
                               The key for the filter.

                               Run  the   DescribePatchProperties  command  to
                               view  lists  of  valid  keys for each operating
                               system type.

                            Values -> (list)
                               The value for the filter key.

                               Run  the   DescribePatchProperties  command  to
                               view  lists  of valid values for each key based
                               on operating system type.

                               (string)

                 ComplianceLevel -> (string)
                     A compliance severity level for all approved patches in a
                     patch baseline.

                 ApproveAfterDays -> (integer)
                     The  number  of days after the release date of each patch
                     matched by the rule that the patch is marked as  approved
                     in  the  patch  baseline. For example, a value of 7 means
                     that patches are approved seven days after they  are  re-
                     leased.

                     This  parameter  is marked as Required: No , but your re-
                     quest must include a value for either ApproveAfterDays or
                     ApproveUntilDate .
