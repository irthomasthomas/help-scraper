UPDATE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW()                        UPDATE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW()



NAME
       update-maintenance-window -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an  existing maintenance window. Only specified parameters are
       modified.

       NOTE:
          The value you specify for Duration determines the specific end  time
          for  the  maintenance window based on the time it begins. No mainte-
          nance window tasks are permitted to start after the  resulting  end-
          time minus the number of hours you specify for Cutoff . For example,
          if the maintenance window starts at 3  PM,  the  duration  is  three
          hours,  and the value you specify for Cutoff is one hour, no mainte-
          nance window tasks can start after 5 PM.

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window to update.

       --name (string)
          The name of the maintenance window.

       --description (string)
          An optional description for the update request.

       --start-date (string)
          The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for  when  you  want
          the maintenance window to become active. StartDate allows you to de-
          lay activation of the maintenance window until the specified  future
          date.

          NOTE:
              When using a rate schedule, if you provide a start date that oc-
              curs in the past, the current date and  time  are  used  as  the
              start date.

       --end-date (string)
          The  date  and  time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want
          the maintenance window to become inactive. EndDate allows you to set
          a  date  and  time in the future when the maintenance window will no
          longer run.

       --schedule (string)
          The schedule of the maintenance window in the form of a cron or rate
          expression.

       --schedule-timezone (string)
          The  time  zone that the scheduled maintenance window executions are
          based on, in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) format.  For
          example: "America/Los_Angeles", "UTC", or "Asia/Seoul". For more in-
          formation, see the Time Zone Database on the IANA website.

       --schedule-offset (integer)
          The number of days to wait after the date and time  specified  by  a
          cron expression before running the maintenance window.

          For  example,  the following cron expression schedules a maintenance
          window to run the third Tuesday of every month at 11:30 PM.
              cron(30 23 ? * TUE#3 *)

          If the schedule offset is 2 , the maintenance window won't run until
          two days later.

       --duration (integer)
          The duration of the maintenance window in hours.

       --cutoff (integer)
          The  number  of  hours before the end of the maintenance window that
          Amazon Web Services Systems Manager stops scheduling new  tasks  for
          execution.

       --allow-unassociated-targets  |  --no-allow-unassociated-targets (bool-
       ean)
          Whether targets must be registered with the maintenance  window  be-
          fore tasks can be defined for those targets.

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          Whether the maintenance window is enabled.

       --replace | --no-replace (boolean)
          If  True  ,  then all fields that are required by the  CreateMainte-
          nanceWindow operation are also required for this  API  request.  Op-
          tional fields that aren't specified are set to null.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To update a maintenance window

       The following update-maintenance-window example updates the name  of  a
       maintenance window.

          aws ssm update-maintenance-window \
              --window-id "mw-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9" \
              --name "My-Renamed-MW"

       Output:

          {
              "Cutoff": 1,
              "Name": "My-Renamed-MW",
              "Schedule": "cron(0 16 ? * TUE *)",
              "Enabled": true,
              "AllowUnassociatedTargets": true,
              "WindowId": "mw-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9",
              "Duration": 4
          }

       Example 2: To disable a maintenance window

       The  following update-maintenance-window example disables a maintenance
       window.

          aws ssm update-maintenance-window \
              --window-id "mw-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9" \
              --no-enabled

       Example 3: To enable a maintenance window

       The following update-maintenance-window example enables  a  maintenance
       window.

          aws ssm update-maintenance-window \
              --window-id "mw-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9" \
              --enabled
