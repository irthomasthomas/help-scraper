OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The  name  of the custom inventory type for which you want to delete
          either all previously collected data or the inventory type itself.

       --schema-delete-option (string)
          Use  the  SchemaDeleteOption  to  delete  a  custom  inventory  type
          (schema).  If  you don't choose this option, the system only deletes
          existing inventory data associated with the custom  inventory  type.
          Choose one of the following options:

          DisableSchema: If you choose this option, the system ignores all in-
          ventory data for the specified version, and any earlier versions. To
          enable  this  schema again, you must call the PutInventory operation
          for a version greater than the disabled version.

          DeleteSchema: This option deletes the specified custom type from the
          Inventory service. You can recreate the schema later, if you want.

          Possible values:

          o DisableSchema

          o DeleteSchema

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Use  this  option  to view a summary of the deletion request without
          deleting any data or the data type. This option is useful  when  you
          only want to understand what will be deleted. Once you validate that
          the data to be deleted is what you intend to delete, you can run the
          same command without specifying the DryRun option.

       --client-token (string)
          User-provided idempotency token.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a custom inventory type

       This example deletes a custom inventory schema.

       Command:

          aws ssm delete-inventory --type-name "Custom:RackInfo" --schema-delete-option "DeleteSchema"

       Output:

          {
            "DeletionId": "d72ac9e8-1f60-4d40-b1c6-bf8c78c68c4d",
            "TypeName": "Custom:RackInfo",
            "DeletionSummary": {
                "TotalCount": 1,
                "RemainingCount": 1,
                "SummaryItems": [
                    {
                        "Version": "1.0",
                        "Count": 1,
                        "RemainingCount": 1
                    }
                ]
            }
          }

       To disable a custom inventory type

       This example disables a custom inventory schema.

       Command:

          aws ssm delete-inventory --type-name "Custom:RackInfo" --schema-delete-option "DisableSchema"

       Output:

          {
            "DeletionId": "6961492a-8163-44ec-aa1e-923364dd0850",
            "TypeName": "Custom:RackInformation",
            "DeletionSummary": {
                "TotalCount": 0,
                "RemainingCount": 0,
                "SummaryItems": []
            }
          }

OUTPUT
       DeletionId -> (string)
          Every DeleteInventory operation is assigned a unique ID. This option
          returns a unique ID. You can use this ID to query the  status  of  a
          delete  operation.  This option is useful for ensuring that a delete
          operation has completed before you begin other operations.

       TypeName -> (string)
          The name of the inventory data type specified in the request.

       DeletionSummary -> (structure)
          A summary of the delete operation. For more information  about  this
          summary,  see  Deleting  custom inventory in the Amazon Web Services
          Systems Manager User Guide .

          TotalCount -> (integer)
              The total number of items to delete. This count  doesn't  change
              during the delete operation.

          RemainingCount -> (integer)
              Remaining number of items to delete.

          SummaryItems -> (list)
              A list of counts and versions for deleted items.

              (structure)
                 Either  a  count,  remaining  count, or a version number in a
                 delete inventory summary.

                 Version -> (string)
                     The inventory type version.

                 Count -> (integer)
                     A count of the number of deleted items.

                 RemainingCount -> (integer)
                     The remaining number of items to delete.
