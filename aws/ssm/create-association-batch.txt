CREATE-ASSOCIATION-BATCH()                          CREATE-ASSOCIATION-BATCH()



NAME
       create-association-batch -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  the  specified Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document
       (SSM document) with the specified managed nodes or targets.

       When you associate a document with one or more managed nodes using  IDs
       or  tags, Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) running
       on the managed node processes the document and configures the  node  as
       specified.

       If you associate a document with a managed node that already has an as-
       sociated document, the system returns the AssociationAlreadyExists  ex-
       ception.

OPTIONS
       --entries (list)
          One or more associations.

          (structure)
              Describes  the association of a Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
              ager document (SSM document) and a managed node.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the SSM document that contains the  configuration
                 information  for the managed node. You can specify Command or
                 Automation runbooks.

                 You can specify  Amazon  Web  Services-predefined  documents,
                 documents  you created, or a document that is shared with you
                 from another account.

                 For SSM documents that are shared with you from other  Amazon
                 Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete SSM doc-
                 ument ARN, in the following format:

                     ``
                     arn:aws:ssm:region :account-id :document/document-name ``

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 94)
                            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 For example:
                     arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Doc-
                     ument

                 For  Amazon  Web  Services-predefined documents and SSM docu-
                 ments you created in your account, you only need  to  specify
                 the  document  name.  For  example, AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline or
                 My-Document .

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The managed node ID.

                 NOTE:
                     InstanceId has been deprecated. To specify a managed node
                     ID  for  an  association,  use the Targets parameter. Re-
                     quests that include the parameter InstanceID with Systems
                     Manager documents (SSM documents) that use schema version
                     2.0 or later will fail. In addition, if you use  the  pa-
                     rameter InstanceId , you can't use the parameters Associ-
                     ationName , DocumentVersion , MaxErrors ,  MaxConcurrency
                     ,  OutputLocation  , or ScheduleExpression . To use these
                     parameters, you must use the Targets parameter.

              Parameters -> (map)
                 A description of the parameters for a document.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)
                     (string)

              AutomationTargetParameterName -> (string)
                 Specify the target for the association. This  target  is  re-
                 quired  for  associations  that use an Automation runbook and
                 target resources by using rate controls. Automation is a  ca-
                 pability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

              DocumentVersion -> (string)
                 The document version.

              Targets -> (list)
                 The managed nodes targeted by the request.

                 (structure)
                     An  array  of  search criteria that targets managed nodes
                     using a key-value pair that you specify.

                     NOTE:
                        One or more targets must be specified for  maintenance
                        window  Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the task,
                        targets are optional for other maintenance window task
                        types  (Automation,  Lambda,  and Step Functions). For
                        more information about running tasks that don't  spec-
                        ify  targets, see Registering maintenance window tasks
                        without targets in the  Amazon  Web  Services  Systems
                        Manager User Guide .

                     Supported formats include the following.

                       source-group-name>

                     For example:

                     o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAM-
                       PLE,i-0471e04240EXAMPLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                       This  example  demonstrates how to target all resources
                       in the resource group ProductionResourceGroup  in  your
                       maintenance window.

                     o Maintenance    window    targets    only    :   Key=re-
                       source-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::IN-
                       STANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC   This example demonstrates how to
                       target only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Amazon  EC2)
                       instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

                     o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup,Val-
                       ues=MyResourceGroup

                     o State Manager association targets  only  :  Key=Instan-
                       ceIds,Values=*    This example demonstrates how to tar-
                       get all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                     Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 A cron expression that specifies a schedule when the associa-
                 tion runs.

              OutputLocation -> (structure)
                 An  S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this re-
                 quest.

                 S3Location -> (structure)
                     An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of  this
                     request.

                     OutputS3Region -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

                     OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                        The name of the S3 bucket.

                     OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                        The S3 bucket subfolder.

              AssociationName -> (string)
                 Specify a descriptive name for the association.

              MaxErrors -> (string)
                 The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops
                 sending requests to run the association  on  additional  tar-
                 gets.  You  can  specify either an absolute number of errors,
                 for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for  exam-
                 ple  10%.  If  you  specify  3, for example, the system stops
                 sending requests when the fourth error is  received.  If  you
                 specify  0,  then the system stops sending requests after the
                 first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 man-
                 aged  nodes  and  set  MaxError to 10%, then the system stops
                 sending the request when the sixth error is received.

                 Executions that are already running an association when  Max-
                 Errors  is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these
                 executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there
                 won't  be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxCon-
                 currency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.

              MaxConcurrency -> (string)
                 The maximum number of targets allowed to run the  association
                 at  the  same time. You can specify a number, for example 10,
                 or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%.  The  de-
                 fault value is 100%, which means all targets run the associa-
                 tion at the same time.

                 If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an  associa-
                 tion while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associa-
                 tions, the association is allowed to run. During the next as-
                 sociation interval, the new managed node will process its as-
                 sociation within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency .

              ComplianceSeverity -> (string)
                 The severity level to assign to the association.

              SyncCompliance -> (string)
                 The mode for generating association compliance. You can spec-
                 ify AUTO or MANUAL . In AUTO mode, the system uses the status
                 of the association execution to determine the compliance sta-
                 tus. If the association execution runs successfully, then the
                 association is  COMPLIANT  .  If  the  association  execution
                 doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT .

                 In  MANUAL  mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a pa-
                 rameter for the  PutComplianceItems API  operation.  In  this
                 case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a capa-
                 bility of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is  managed
                 by your direct call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

                 By default, all associations use AUTO mode.

              ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval -> (boolean)
                 By  default,  when  you create a new associations, the system
                 runs it immediately after it is created and then according to
                 the  schedule you specified. Specify this option if you don't
                 want an association to run immediately after you  create  it.
                 This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.

              CalendarNames -> (list)
                 The  names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Cal-
                 endar type documents your associations are gated  under.  The
                 associations  only run when that Change Calendar is open. For
                 more information, see Amazon  Web  Services  Systems  Manager
                 Change Calendar .

                 (string)

              TargetLocations -> (list)
                 Use  this action to create an association in multiple Regions

                 (structure)
                     The combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon
                     Web  Services accounts targeted by the current Automation
                     execution.

                     Accounts -> (list)
                        The Amazon Web Services accounts targeted by the  cur-

                     TargetLocationMaxConcurrency -> (string)
                        The maximum number of Amazon Web Services Regions  and
                        Amazon  Web Services accounts allowed to run the Auto-
                        mation concurrently.

                     TargetLocationMaxErrors -> (string)
                        The maximum number of errors allowed before the system
                        stops  queueing  additional  Automation executions for

                        IgnorePollAlarmFailure -> (boolean)
                            If  you  specify true for this value, your automa-
                            tion or command continue to run even if  we  can't
                            gather  information about the state of your Cloud-
                            Watch alarm. The default value is false .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create multiple associations

       This  example  associates  a  configuration  document with multiple in-
       stances. The output returns a list of successful and failed operations,
       if applicable.

                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 A cron expression that specifies a schedule when the associa-
                 tion runs.

              OutputLocation -> (structure)
                 An  S3  bucket  where you want to store the output details of
                 the request.

                 S3Location -> (structure)
                     An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of  this
                     request.

                     OutputS3Region -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

                     OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                        The name of the S3 bucket.

                     OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                        The S3 bucket subfolder.

              LastExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date on which the association was last run.

              LastSuccessfulExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The last date on which the association was successfully run.

              AssociationName -> (string)
                 The association name.

              MaxErrors -> (string)
                 The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops
                 sending requests to run the association  on  additional  tar-
                 gets.  You  can  specify either an absolute number of errors,
                 for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for  exam-
                 ple  10%.  If  you  specify  3, for example, the system stops
                 sending requests when the fourth error is  received.  If  you
                 specify  0,  then the system stops sending requests after the
                 first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 man-
                 aged  nodes  and  set  MaxError to 10%, then the system stops
                 sending the request when the sixth error is received.

                 Executions that are already running an association when  Max-
                 Errors  is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these
                 executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there
                 won't  be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxCon-
                 currency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.

              MaxConcurrency -> (string)
                 The maximum number of targets allowed to run the  association
                 at  the  same time. You can specify a number, for example 10,
                 or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%.  The  de-
                 fault value is 100%, which means all targets run the associa-
                 tion at the same time.

                 If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an  associa-
                 tion while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associa-
                 tions, the association is allowed to run. During the next as-
                 sociation interval, the new managed node will process its as-
                 sociation within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency .

              ComplianceSeverity -> (string)
                 The severity level that is assigned to the association.

              SyncCompliance -> (string)
                 The mode for generating association compliance. You can spec-
                 ify AUTO or MANUAL . In AUTO mode, the system uses the status
                 of the association execution to determine the compliance sta-
                 tus. If the association execution runs successfully, then the
                 association is  COMPLIANT  .  If  the  association  execution
                 doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT .

                 In  MANUAL  mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a pa-
                 rameter for the  PutComplianceItems API  operation.  In  this
                 case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a capa-
                 bility of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is  managed
                 by your direct call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

                 By default, all associations use AUTO mode.

              ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval -> (boolean)
                 By  default,  when  you create a new associations, the system
                 runs it immediately after it is created and then according to
                 the  schedule you specified. Specify this option if you don't
                 want an association to run immediately after you  create  it.
                 This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.

              CalendarNames -> (list)
                 The  names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Cal-
                 endar type documents your associations are gated  under.  The
                 associations  only run when that change calendar is open. For
                 more information, see Amazon  Web  Services  Systems  Manager
                 Change Calendar .

                        mation concurrently.

                     TargetLocationMaxErrors -> (string)
                        The maximum number of errors allowed before the system
                        stops  queueing  additional  Automation executions for
                        the currently running Automation.

                     ExecutionRoleName -> (string)
                        The Automation execution role used  by  the  currently
                        running  Automation.  If  not  specified,  the default
                        value is AWS-SystemsManager-AutomationExecutionRole .

                        System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 1733)
                               Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                     For example:

                        ment/My-Shared-Document

                     For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM doc-
                     uments you created in your  account,  you  only  need  to
                     specify  the  document name. For example, AWS-ApplyPatch-
                     Baseline or My-Document .

                 InstanceId -> (string)
                     The managed node ID.

                     NOTE:
                        InstanceId has been deprecated. To specify  a  managed
                        node ID for an association, use the Targets parameter.
                        Requests that include the  parameter  InstanceID  with
                        Systems  Manager  documents  (SSM  documents) that use
                        schema version 2.0 or later will fail. In addition, if
                        you  use  the parameter InstanceId , you can't use the
                        parameters AssociationName , DocumentVersion ,  MaxEr-
                        rors  , MaxConcurrency , OutputLocation , or Schedule-
                        Expression . To use these parameters, you must use the
                        Targets parameter.

                 Parameters -> (map)
                     A description of the parameters for a document.

                     key -> (string)

                        (string)

                 AutomationTargetParameterName -> (string)
                     Specify  the  target  for the association. This target is
                     required for associations that use an Automation  runbook
                     and  target  resources by using rate controls. Automation
                     is a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

                 DocumentVersion -> (string)
                     The document version.

                 Targets -> (list)

                        using a key-value pair that you specify.

                        NOTE:
                            One  or more targets must be specified for mainte-
                            nance window Run Command-type tasks. Depending  on
                            the  task,  targets are optional for other mainte-
                            nance window task types (Automation,  Lambda,  and
                            Step  Functions).  For more information about run-
                            ning  tasks  that  don't  specify   targets,   see

                        Key -> (string)
                            User-defined criteria for  sending  commands  that
                            target managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                        Values -> (list)
                            User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For exam-
                            ple, if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could
                            specify  value:WebServer  to  run a command on in-
                            stances that include EC2 tags  of  ServerRole,Web-
                            Server .

                            Depending  on the type of target, the maximum num-
                            ber of values for a key might be  lower  than  the
                            global maximum of 50.

                            (string)

                 ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                     A  cron expression that specifies a schedule when the as-
                     sociation runs.

                 OutputLocation -> (structure)
                     An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of  this
                     request.

                     S3Location -> (structure)
                        An  S3  bucket  where you want to store the results of
                        this request.

                        OutputS3Region -> (string)
                            The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

                        OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                            The name of the S3 bucket.

                        OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                            The S3 bucket subfolder.

                 AssociationName -> (string)
                     Specify a descriptive name for the association.

                 MaxErrors -> (string)
                     The number of errors that are allowed before  the  system
                     stops  sending  requests  to run the association on addi-
                     tional targets. You can specify either an absolute number
                     of  errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target
                     set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example,  the
                     system  stops  sending  requests when the fourth error is
                     received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending
                     requests after the first error is returned. If you run an
                     association on 50 managed nodes and set MaxError to  10%,
                     then  the system stops sending the request when the sixth
                     error is received.

                     Executions that are already running an  association  when
                     MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of
                     these executions may fail as well. If you need to  ensure
                     that  there  won't  be more than max-errors failed execu-
                     tions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that executions proceed
                     one at a time.

                 MaxConcurrency -> (string)
                     The maximum number of targets allowed to run the associa-
                     tion at the same time. You can specify a number, for  ex-
                     ample  10, or a percentage of the target set, for example
                     10%. The default value is 100%, which means  all  targets
                     run the association at the same time.

                     If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an asso-
                     ciation while Systems Manager is  running  MaxConcurrency
                     associations,  the  association is allowed to run. During
                     the next association interval, the new managed node  will
                     process  its  association  within the limit specified for
                     MaxConcurrency .

                 ComplianceSeverity -> (string)
                     The severity level to assign to the association.

                 SyncCompliance -> (string)
                     The mode for generating association compliance.  You  can
                     specify  AUTO  or  MANUAL . In AUTO mode, the system uses
                     the status of the association execution to determine  the
                     compliance status. If the association execution runs suc-
                     cessfully, then the association is COMPLIANT . If the as-
                     sociation execution doesn't run successfully, the associ-
                     ation is NON-COMPLIANT .

                     In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId  as  a
                     parameter  for  the  PutComplianceItems API operation. In
                     this case, compliance data isn't managed  by  State  Man-
                     ager,  a  capability  of Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
                     ager. It is managed by your direct call to  the   PutCom-
                     plianceItems API operation.

                     By default, all associations use AUTO mode.

                 ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval -> (boolean)
                     By  default, when you create a new associations, the sys-
                     tem runs it immediately after it is created and then  ac-
                     cording  to  the schedule you specified. Specify this op-
                     tion if you don't want an association to run  immediately
                     after  you  create it. This parameter isn't supported for
                     rate expressions.

                 CalendarNames -> (list)
                     The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of  the  Change
                     Calendar  type  documents your associations are gated un-
                     der. The associations only run when that Change  Calendar
                     is  open.  For  more information, see Amazon Web Services
                     Systems Manager Change Calendar .

                        Automation execution.

                        Accounts -> (list)
                            The  Amazon  Web Services accounts targeted by the
