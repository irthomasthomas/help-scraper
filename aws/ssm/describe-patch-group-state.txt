OPTIONS
       --patch-group (string)
          The name of the patch group  whose  patch  snapshot  should  be  re-
          trieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the state of a patch group

       The   following   describe-patch-group-state   example   retrieves  the
       high-level patch compliance summary for a patch group.

          aws ssm describe-patch-group-state \
              --patch-group "Production"

       Output:

          {
              "Instances": 21,
              "InstancesWithCriticalNonCompliantPatches": 1,
              "InstancesWithFailedPatches": 2,
              "InstancesWithInstalledOtherPatches": 3,
              "InstancesWithInstalledPatches": 21,
              "InstancesWithInstalledPendingRebootPatches": 2,
              "InstancesWithInstalledRejectedPatches": 1,
              "InstancesWithMissingPatches": 3,
              "InstancesWithNotApplicablePatches": 4,
              "InstancesWithOtherNonCompliantPatches": 1,
              "InstancesWithSecurityNonCompliantPatches": 1,
              "InstancesWithUnreportedNotApplicablePatches": 2
          }

OUTPUT
       Instances -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes in the patch group.

       InstancesWithInstalledPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with installed patches.

       InstancesWithInstalledOtherPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of managed nodes with patches installed that aren't de-
          fined in the patch baseline.

       InstancesWithInstalledPendingRebootPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches installed by Patch  Manager
          that  haven't been rebooted after the patch installation. The status
          of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

       InstancesWithInstalledRejectedPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches installed that  are  speci-
          fied  in  a  RejectedPatches  list.  Patches  with  a  status of IN-
          STALLED_REJECTED were typically installed before they were added  to
          a RejectedPatches list.

          NOTE:
              If  ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY  is  the  specified option for Rejected-
              PatchesAction ,  the  value  of  InstancesWithInstalledRejected-
              Patches will always be 0 (zero).

       InstancesWithMissingPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of  managed  nodes  with missing patches from the patch
          baseline.

       InstancesWithFailedPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches  from  the  patch  baseline
          that failed to install.

       InstancesWithNotApplicablePatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches that aren't applicable.

       InstancesWithUnreportedNotApplicablePatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of  managed nodes with NotApplicable patches beyond the
          supported limit, which aren't reported by name to Inventory.  Inven-
          tory is a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

       InstancesWithCriticalNonCompliantPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of  managed  nodes  where patches that are specified as
          Critical for compliance reporting in the patch baseline  aren't  in-
          stalled.  These  patches might be missing, have failed installation,
          were rejected, or were installed but  awaiting  a  required  managed
          node reboot. The status of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

       InstancesWithSecurityNonCompliantPatches -> (integer)
          The  number of managed nodes where patches that are specified as Se-
          curity in a patch advisory aren't installed. These patches might  be
          missing,  have failed installation, were rejected, or were installed
          but awaiting a required managed node reboot.  The  status  of  these
          managed nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

          fied as other than Critical or Security but  aren't  compliant  with
          the patch baseline. The status of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLI-
          ANT .
