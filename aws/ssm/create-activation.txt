CREATE-ACTIVATION()                                        CREATE-ACTIVATION()



NAME
       create-activation -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  an activation code and activation ID you can use to register
       your on-premises servers, edge devices, or virtual  machine  (VM)  with
       Amazon  Web  Services  Systems Manager. Registering these machines with
       Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems  Manager
       capabilities.  You  use  the activation code and ID when installing SSM
       Agent on machines in your  hybrid  environment.  For  more  information
       about requirements for managing on-premises machines using Systems Man-
       ager, see Using Amazon Web Services Systems Manager in hybrid and  mul-
       ticloud  environments  in  the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances,  edge  devices,
          and on-premises servers and VMs that are configured for Systems Man-
          ager are all called managed nodes .

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A user-defined description of the resource that you want to register
          with Systems Manager.

          WARNING:
              Don't enter personally identifiable information in this field.

       --default-instance-name (string)
          The  name  of  the registered, managed node as it will appear in the
          Amazon Web Services Systems Manager console or when you use the Ama-
          zon  Web  Services  command  line  tools to list Systems Manager re-
          sources.

          WARNING:
              Don't enter personally identifiable information in this field.

       --iam-role (string)
          The name of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role  that  you
          want  to  assign to the managed node. This IAM role must provide As-
          sumeRole permissions for the Amazon  Web  Services  Systems  Manager
          service  principal  ssm.amazonaws.com  .  For  more information, see
          Create the IAM service role required for Systems Manager in a hybrid
          and  multicloud environments in the Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
          ager User Guide .

          NOTE:
              You can't specify an IAM service-linked role for this parameter.
              You must create a unique role.

       --registration-limit (integer)
          Specify  the  maximum  number of managed nodes you want to register.
          The default value is 1 .

       --expiration-date (timestamp)
          The date by which this activation request should  expire,  in  time-
          stamp  format, such as "2024-07-07T00:00:00". You can specify a date
          up to 30 days in advance. If you don't provide an  expiration  date,
          the activation code expires in 24 hours.

       --tags (list)
          Optional  metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to
          categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose,  owner,
          or  environment. For example, you might want to tag an activation to
          identify which servers or virtual machines (VMs) in your on-premises
          environment  you intend to activate. In this case, you could specify
          the following key-value pairs:

          o Key=OS,Value=Windows

          o Key=Environment,Value=Production

          WARNING:
              When you install SSM Agent on your on-premises servers and  VMs,
              you  specify an activation ID and code. When you specify the ac-
              tivation ID and code, tags assigned to the activation are  auto-
              matically applied to the on-premises servers or VMs.

          You  can't  add  tags to or delete tags from an existing activation.
          You can tag your on-premises servers, edge devices,  and  VMs  after
          they  connect to Systems Manager for the first time and are assigned
          a managed node ID. This means they are listed in the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices  Systems  Manager  console  with  an  ID that is prefixed with
          "mi-". For information about how to add tags to your managed  nodes,
          see   AddTagsToResource  .  For information about how to remove tags
          from your managed nodes, see  RemoveTagsFromResource .

          (structure)
              Metadata that you assign to your Amazon Web Services  resources.
              Tags  enable you to categorize your resources in different ways,
              for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.  In  Amazon  Web
              Services  Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems Manager
              documents (SSM documents), managed nodes,  maintenance  windows,
              parameters, patch baselines, OpsItems, and OpsMetadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a managed instance activation

       The following create-activation example creates a managed instance  ac-
       tivation.

          aws ssm create-activation \
              --default-instance-name "HybridWebServers" \
              --iam-role "HybridWebServersRole" \
              --registration-limit 5

       Output:

          {
              "ActivationId": "5743558d-563b-4457-8682-d16c3EXAMPLE",
              "ActivationCode": "dRmgnYaFv567vEXAMPLE"
          }

       For  more information, see Step 4: Create a Managed-Instance Activation
       for a Hybrid Environment in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ActivationId -> (string)
          The ID number generated by the system when it processed the  activa-
          tion. The activation ID functions like a user name.

       ActivationCode -> (string)
          The  code the system generates when it processes the activation. The
          activation code functions like a password to validate the activation
          ID.
