GET-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-TASK()                    GET-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-TASK()



NAME
       get-maintenance-window-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the details of a maintenance window task.

       NOTE:
          For  maintenance  window tasks without a specified target, you can't
          supply values for --max-errors and --max-concurrency . Instead,  the
          system  inserts  a placeholder value of 1 , which may be reported in
          the response to this command. These values don't affect the  running
          of your task and can be ignored.

       To  retrieve  a  list of tasks in a maintenance window, instead use the
       DescribeMaintenanceWindowTasks command.

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The maintenance window ID that includes the task to retrieve.

       --window-task-id (string)
          The maintenance window task ID to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       WindowTaskId -> (string)
          The retrieved maintenance window task ID.

       Targets -> (list)
          The targets where the task should run.

          (structure)
              An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes  using  a

              o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

              o Run Command and Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=re-
                source-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup   This exam-
                ple demonstrates how to target all resources in  the  resource
                group ProductionResourceGroup in your maintenance window.

              o Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=resource-groups:Re-
                sourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC
                This  example  demonstrates  how to target only Amazon Elastic
                Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in your  mainte-
                nance window.

              o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyResource-
                Group

              o State Manager association targets only :  Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=*    This  example  demonstrates how to target all managed
                instances in the Amazon Web Services Region where the associa-
                tion was created.

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged nodes using Key,Value parameters,  see  Targeting  multiple
              instances  in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide
              .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined criteria for sending commands that  target  man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if you
                 specified tag:ServerRole , you could specify  value:WebServer
                 to  run  a  command  on  instances  that  include EC2 tags of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

       TaskArn -> (string)
          The  resource  that  the task used during execution. For RUN_COMMAND
          and AUTOMATION task types, the value of TaskArn is the SSM  document
          name/ARN.  For LAMBDA tasks, the value is the function name/ARN. For
          STEP_FUNCTIONS tasks, the value is the state machine ARN.

       ServiceRoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) service role to use to publish Amazon Simple Notification Ser-
          vice (Amazon SNS) notifications for maintenance window  Run  Command
          tasks.

              pass to a task when it runs, instead use the  Parameters  option
              in the TaskInvocationParameters structure. For information about
              how Systems Manager handles  these  options  for  the  supported
              maintenance window task types, see  MaintenanceWindowTaskInvoca-
              tionParameters .

                        TaskParameters has been deprecated. To specify parame-
                        ters to pass to a task when it runs, instead  use  the
                        Parameters   option  in  the  TaskInvocationParameters
                        structure. For information about how  Systems  Manager
                        handles  these  options  for the supported maintenance
                        window task types,  see   MaintenanceWindowTaskInvoca-
                        tionParameters .

                     For  AUTOMATION  task  types, Amazon Web Services Systems
                     Manager ignores any values specified  for  these  parame-
                     ters.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)
                     (string)

          StepFunctions -> (structure)
              The parameters for a STEP_FUNCTIONS task type.

              Input -> (string)
                 The inputs for the STEP_FUNCTIONS task.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the STEP_FUNCTIONS task.

          Lambda -> (structure)
              The parameters for a LAMBDA task type.

              ClientContext -> (string)
                 Pass  client-specific information to the Lambda function that
                 you are invoking. You can then process the client information
                 in  your  Lambda  function  as you choose through the context
                 variable.

              Qualifier -> (string)
                 (Optional) Specify an Lambda function version or alias  name.
                 If  you  specify  a  function version, the operation uses the
                 qualified function Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  to  invoke  a
                 specific  Lambda  function. If you specify an alias name, the
                 operation uses the alias ARN to invoke  the  Lambda  function
                 version to which the alias points.

              Payload -> (blob)
                 JSON to provide to your Lambda function as input.

       Priority -> (integer)
          The  priority  of  the  task when it runs. The lower the number, the
          higher the priority. Tasks that have the same priority are scheduled
          in parallel.

       MaxConcurrency -> (string)
          The maximum number of targets allowed to run this task in parallel.

          NOTE:
              For  maintenance  window  tasks  without a target specified, you
              can't supply a value for this option. Instead,  the  system  in-
              serts  a  placeholder  value of 1 , which may be reported in the
              response to this command. This value doesn't affect the  running
              of your task and can be ignored.

       MaxErrors -> (string)
          The  maximum  number  of  errors allowed before the task stops being
          scheduled.

          NOTE:
              For maintenance window tasks without  a  target  specified,  you
              can't  supply  a  value for this option. Instead, the system in-
              serts a placeholder value of 1 , which may be  reported  in  the
              response  to this command. This value doesn't affect the running
              of your task and can be ignored.

       LoggingInfo -> (structure)
          The location in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) where  the
          task results are logged.

          NOTE:
              LoggingInfo  has  been  deprecated.  To specify an Amazon Simple
              Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to contain logs, instead  use
              the  OutputS3BucketName  and  OutputS3KeyPrefix  options  in the
              TaskInvocationParameters structure. For  information  about  how
              Amazon  Web  Services  Systems Manager handles these options for
              the  supported  maintenance  window  task  types,  see   Mainte-
              nanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters .

          S3BucketName -> (string)
              The name of an S3 bucket where execution logs are stored.

          S3KeyPrefix -> (string)
              (Optional) The S3 bucket subfolder.

          S3Region -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region where the S3 bucket is located.

       Name -> (string)
          The retrieved task name.

       Description -> (string)
          The retrieved task description.

       CutoffBehavior -> (string)
          The  action to take on tasks when the maintenance window cutoff time
          is reached. CONTINUE_TASK means that tasks continue to run. For  Au-
          tomation,  Lambda, Step Functions tasks, CANCEL_TASK means that cur-
          rently running task invocations continue, but no  new  task  invoca-
          tions are started. For Run Command tasks, CANCEL_TASK means the sys-
          tem attempts to stop the task by sending a CancelCommand operation.

       AlarmConfiguration -> (structure)
          The details for the CloudWatch alarm you applied to your maintenance
          window task.

          IgnorePollAlarmFailure -> (boolean)
              When  this  value is true , your automation or command continues
              to run in cases where we cant retrieve alarm status  information
              from  CloudWatch.  In  cases  where  we successfully retrieve an
              alarm status of OK or INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the automation or  com-
              mand  continues  to  run,  regardless  of this value. Default is
              false .

          Alarms -> (list)
              The name of the CloudWatch alarm specified in the configuration.

              (structure)
                 A CloudWatch alarm you apply to an automation or command.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of your CloudWatch alarm.
