DESCRIBE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-SCHEDULE()  DESCRIBE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-SCHEDULE()



NAME
       describe-maintenance-window-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about upcoming executions of a maintenance win-
       dow.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-maintenance-window-schedule is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: ScheduledWindowExecutions

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window to retrieve information about.

       --targets (list)
          The managed node ID or key-value pair to retrieve information about.

          (structure)
              An  array  of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a
              key-value pair that you specify.

              NOTE:
                 One or more targets must be specified for maintenance  window
                 Run  Command-type  tasks.  Depending on the task, targets are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda,  and Step Functions). For more information about run-
                 ning tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering  main-
                 tenance  window  tasks without targets in the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

              Supported formats include the following.
                 For all Systems Manager capabilities:

              o Key=tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2
                 For Automation and Change Manager:

              o Key=tag:tag-key,Values=tag-value

              o Key=ResourceGroup,Values=resource-group-name

              o Key=ParameterValues,Values=value-1,value-2,value-3

              o To target all instances in the Amazon Web Services Region:

                o Key=AWS::EC2::Instance,Values=*

                o Key=InstanceIds,Values=*
                 For Run Command and Maintenance Windows:

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=instance-id-1,instance-id-2,in-
                stance-id-3

              o Key=tag:tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2

              o Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=resource-group-name

              o Additionally,  Maintenance  Windows support targeting resource
                types:

                o Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=re-
                  source-type-1,resource-type-2
                 For State Manager:

              o To target all instances in the Amazon Web Services Region:

                o Key=InstanceIds,Values=*

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged  nodes  using  Key,Value parameters, see Targeting multiple
              managed nodes in the Amazon Web Services  Systems  Manager  User
              Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined  criteria  for sending commands that target man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For example, if  you
                 specified  tag:ServerRole , you could specify value:WebServer
                 to run a command  on  instances  that  include  EC2  tags  of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --resource-type (string)
          The type of resource you want to retrieve information about. For ex-
          ample, INSTANCE .

          Possible values:

          o INSTANCE

          o RESOURCE_GROUP

       --filters (list)
          Filters  used  to  limit  the range of results. For example, you can
          limit maintenance window executions to only those  scheduled  before
          or after a certain date and time.

          (structure)
              Defines  a  filter  used in Patch Manager APIs. Supported filter
              keys depend on the API operation that includes the filter. Patch
              Manager  API operations that use PatchOrchestratorFilter include
              the following:

              o DescribeAvailablePatches

              o DescribeInstancePatches

              o DescribePatchBaselines

              o DescribePatchGroups

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value for the filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
