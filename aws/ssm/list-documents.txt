LIST-DOCUMENTS()                                              LIST-DOCUMENTS()



NAME
       list-documents -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all  Systems Manager (SSM) documents in the current Amazon Web
       Services account and Amazon Web Services Region. You can limit the  re-
       sults of this request by using a filter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-documents  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DocumentIdentifiers

OPTIONS
       --document-filter-list (list)
          This data type is deprecated. Instead, use Filters .

          (structure)
              This data type is deprecated. Instead,  use   DocumentKeyValues-
              Filter .

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "Name"|"Owner"|"PlatformTypes"|"DocumentType",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filters (list)
          One  or more DocumentKeyValuesFilter objects. Use a filter to return
          a more specific list of results. For keys, you can  specify  one  or
          more key-value pair tags that have been applied to a document. Other
          valid keys include Owner , Name , PlatformTypes , DocumentType , and
          TargetType   .   For  example,  to  return  documents  you  own  use
          Key=Owner,Values=Self . To specify a custom key-value pair, use  the
          format Key=tag:tagName,Values=valueName .

          NOTE:
              This  API operation only supports filtering documents by using a
              single tag  key  and  one  or  more  tag  values.  For  example:
              Key=tag:tagName,Values=valueName1,valueName2

          (structure)
              One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list
              of documents.

              For keys, you can specify one or more tags that  have  been  ap-
              plied to a document.

              You  can  also  use  Amazon  Web Services-provided keys, some of
              which have specific allowed values. These keys and their associ-
              ated values are as follows:
                 DocumentType

              o ApplicationConfiguration

              o ApplicationConfigurationSchema

              o Automation

              o ChangeCalendar

              o Command

              o Package

              o Policy

              o Session

                Owner

              Note  that only one Owner can be specified in a request. For ex-
              ample: Key=Owner,Values=Self .

              o Amazon

              o Private

              o Public

              o Self

              o ThirdParty

                PlatformTypes

              o Linux

              o Windows
                 Name is another Amazon Web Services-provided key. If you  use
                 Name  as a key, you can use a name prefix to return a list of
                 documents. For example, in the Amazon Web  Services  CLI,  to
                 return  a  list of all documents that begin with Te , run the
                 following command:

                 aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=Name,Values=Te

              You can also use the  TargetType  Amazon  Web  Services-provided
              key.  For  a list of valid resource type values that can be used
              with this key, see Amazon Web  Services  resource  and  property
              types reference in the CloudFormation User Guide .

              If you specify more than two keys, only documents that are iden-
              tified by all the tags are returned in the results. If you spec-
              ify  more  than two values for a key, documents that are identi-
              fied by any of the values are returned in the results.

              To specify a custom key-value pair, use the format  Key=tag:tag-
              Name,Values=valueName .

              For  example,  if  you created a key called region and are using
              the Amazon Web Services CLI to call the list-documents command:
                 aws   ssm   list-documents   --filters    Key=tag:region,Val-
                 ues=east,west Key=Owner,Values=Self

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter key.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value for the filter key.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list documents

       The following list-documents example lists documents owned by  the  re-
       questing account tagged with the custom tag.

          aws ssm list-documents \
              --filters Key=Owner,Values=Self Key=tag:DocUse,Values=Testing

       Output:

          {
              "DocumentIdentifiers": [
                  {
                      "Name": "Example",
