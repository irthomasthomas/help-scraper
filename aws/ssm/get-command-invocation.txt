GET-COMMAND-INVOCATION()                              GET-COMMAND-INVOCATION()



NAME
       get-command-invocation -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed information about command execution for an invocation
       or plugin.
          GetCommandInvocation only gives the execution status of a plugin  in
          a  document.  To get the command execution status on a specific man-
          aged node, use  ListCommandInvocations . To get the  command  execu-
          tion status across managed nodes, use  ListCommands .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --command-id (string)
          (Required) The parent command ID of the invocation plugin.

       --instance-id (string)
          (Required)  The  ID  of  the managed node targeted by the command. A
          managed node can be an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) in-
          stance, edge device, and on-premises server or VM in your hybrid en-
          vironment that is configured for Amazon Web  Services  Systems  Man-
          ager.

       --plugin-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  step for which you want detailed results. If the
          document contains only one step, you can omit the name  and  details
          for that step. If the document contains more than one step, you must
          specify the name of the step for which you want to view details.  Be
          sure  to specify the name of the step, not the name of a plugin like
          aws:RunShellScript .

          To find the PluginName , check the document  content  and  find  the
          name  of the step you want details for. Alternatively, use  ListCom-
          mandInvocations with the CommandId and Details parameters. The Plug-
          inName is the Name attribute of the CommandPlugin object in the Com-
          mandPlugins list.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       CommandId -> (string)
          The parent command ID of the invocation plugin.

       InstanceId -> (string)
          The ID of the managed node targeted by the command. A  managed  node
          can  be  an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, edge
          device, or on-premises server or VM in your hybrid environment  that
          is configured for Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

       Comment -> (string)
          The comment text for the command.

       DocumentName -> (string)
          The  name  of  the  document  that  was  run.  For example, AWS-Run-
          ShellScript .

       DocumentVersion -> (string)
          The Systems Manager document (SSM document) version used in the  re-
          quest.

       PluginName -> (string)
          The  name  of  the  plugin, or step name , for which details are re-
          ported. For example, aws:RunShellScript is a plugin.

       ResponseCode -> (integer)
          The error level response code for the plugin script. If the response
          code  is -1 , then the command hasn't started running on the managed
          node, or it wasn't received by the node.

       ExecutionStartDateTime -> (string)
          The date and time the plugin started  running.  Date  and  time  are
          written in ISO 8601 format. For example, June 7, 2017 is represented
          as 2017-06-7. The following sample Amazon Web Services  CLI  command
          uses the InvokedBefore filter.
              aws      ssm      list-commands     --filters     key=InvokedBe-
              fore,value=2017-06-07T00:00:00Z

          If the plugin hasn't started to run, the string is empty.

       ExecutionElapsedTime -> (string)
          Duration since ExecutionStartDateTime .

       ExecutionEndDateTime -> (string)
          The date and time the plugin finished running.  Date  and  time  are
          written in ISO 8601 format. For example, June 7, 2017 is represented
          as 2017-06-7. The following sample Amazon Web Services  CLI  command
          uses the InvokedAfter filter.
              aws        ssm       list-commands       --filters       key=In-
              vokedAfter,value=2017-06-07T00:00:00Z

          If the plugin hasn't started to run, the string is empty.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of this invocation plugin. This status can  be  different
          than StatusDetails .

       StatusDetails -> (string)
          A  detailed  status of the command execution for an invocation. Sta-
          tusDetails includes more information than Status because it includes
          states resulting from error and concurrency control parameters. Sta-
          tusDetails can show different results than Status . For more  infor-
          mation  about  these statuses, see Understanding command statuses in
          the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide  .  StatusDetails
          can be one of the following values:

          o Pending: The command hasn't been sent to the managed node.

          o In  Progress:  The  command  has been sent to the managed node but
            hasn't reached a terminal state.

          o Delayed: The system attempted to send the command to  the  target,
            but  the  target  wasn't  available. The managed node might not be
            available because of network issues, because the node was stopped,
            or  for  similar  reasons. The system will try to send the command
            again.

          o Success: The command or plugin ran successfully. This is a  termi-
            nal state.

          o Delivery  Timed  Out:  The command wasn't delivered to the managed
            node before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts  don't
            count  against  the  parent command's MaxErrors limit, but they do
            contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or  In-
            complete. This is a terminal state.

          o Execution  Timed  Out:  The  command started to run on the managed
            node, but the execution wasn't complete  before  the  timeout  ex-
            pired. Execution timeouts count against the MaxErrors limit of the
            parent command. This is a terminal state.

          o Failed: The command wasn't run successfully on the  managed  node.
            For a plugin, this indicates that the result code wasn't zero. For
            a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for  one
            or more plugins wasn't zero. Invocation failures count against the
            MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.

          o Cancelled: The command was terminated  before  it  was  completed.
            This is a terminal state.

          o Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the managed node.
            The node might not exist or might not be responding. Undeliverable
            invocations  don't  count  against  the parent command's MaxErrors
            limit and don't contribute to whether the parent command status is
            Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.

          o Terminated:  The  parent  command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and
            subsequent command invocations were canceled by the  system.  This
            is a terminal state.

       StandardOutputContent -> (string)
          The first 24,000 characters written by the plugin to stdout . If the
          command hasn't finished running, if ExecutionStatus is neither  Suc-
          ceeded nor Failed, then this string is empty.

       StandardOutputUrl -> (string)
          The  URL  for  the  complete text written by the plugin to stdout in
          Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). If an  S3  bucket  wasn't
          specified, then this string is empty.

       StandardErrorContent -> (string)
          The  first 8,000 characters written by the plugin to stderr . If the
          command hasn't finished running, then this string is empty.

       StandardErrorUrl -> (string)
          The URL for the complete text written by the plugin to stderr  .  If
          the command hasn't finished running, then this string is empty.

       CloudWatchOutputConfig -> (structure)
          Amazon  CloudWatch  Logs  information where Systems Manager sent the
          command output.

          CloudWatchLogGroupName -> (string)
              The name of the CloudWatch Logs log group where you want to send
              command  output.  If  you don't specify a group name, Amazon Web
              Services Systems Manager automatically creates a log  group  for
              you. The log group uses the following naming format:

                 ``
                 aws/ssm/SystemsManagerDocumentName ``

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 448)
                        Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          CloudWatchOutputEnabled -> (boolean)
              Enables  Systems  Manager  to  send command output to CloudWatch
              Logs.
