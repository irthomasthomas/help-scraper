NAME
       describe-ops-items -

DESCRIPTION
       Query  a  set of OpsItems. You must have permission in Identity and Ac-
       cess Management (IAM) to query a list of OpsItems.  For  more  informa-
       tion,  see  Set up OpsCenter in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
       User Guide .

       Operations engineers and IT professionals use Amazon Web Services  Sys-
       tems  Manager OpsCenter to view, investigate, and remediate operational
       issues impacting the performance and health of their  Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  resources. For more information, see OpsCenter in the Amazon Web
       Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       describe-ops-items is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: OpsItemSummaries

OPTIONS
       --ops-item-filters (list)
          One or more filters to limit the response.

          o Key: CreatedTime Operations: GreaterThan, LessThan

          o Key: LastModifiedBy Operations: Contains, Equals

          o Key: LastModifiedTime Operations: GreaterThan, LessThan

          o Key: Priority Operations: Equals

          o Key: Source Operations: Contains, Equals

          o Key: Status Operations: Equals

          o Key: Title* Operations: Equals,Contains

          o Key: OperationalData** Operations: Equals

          o Key: OperationalDataKey Operations: Equals

          o Key: OperationalDataValue Operations: Equals, Contains

          o Key: OpsItemId Operations: Equals

          o Key: ResourceId Operations: Contains

          o Key: AutomationId Operations: Equals

          o Key: AccountId Operations: Equals


          *
          The  Equals  operator for Title matches the first 100 characters. If
          you specify more than 100 characters, they system returns  an  error
          that the filter value exceeds the length limit.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 107)
                 Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.


                 **
                 If you filter the response by using the OperationalData oper-
                 ator, specify a key-value pair by using  the  following  JSON
                 format: {"key":"key_name","value":"a_value"}

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 111)
                 Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                 (structure)
              Describes an OpsItem filter.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value.

                 (string)

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator used by the filter call.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "Status"|"CreatedBy"|"Source"|"Priority"|"Title"|"OpsItemId"|"CreatedTime"|"LastModifiedTime"|"ActualStartTime"|"ActualEndTime"|"PlannedStartTime"|"PlannedEndTime"|"OperationalData"|"OperationalDataKey"|"OperationalDataValue"|"ResourceId"|"AutomationId"|"Category"|"Severity"|"OpsItemType"|"ChangeRequestByRequesterArn"|"ChangeRequestByRequesterName"|"ChangeRequestByApproverArn"|"ChangeRequestByApproverName"|"ChangeRequestByTemplate"|"ChangeRequestByTargetsResourceGroup"|"InsightByType"|"AccountId",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Operator": "Equal"|"Contains"|"GreaterThan"|"LessThan"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following describe-ops-items example displays a list  of  all  open
       OpsItems in your AWS account.
