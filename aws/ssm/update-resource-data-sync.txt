UPDATE-RESOURCE-DATA-SYNC()                        UPDATE-RESOURCE-DATA-SYNC()



NAME
       update-resource-data-sync -

DESCRIPTION
       Update  a resource data sync. After you create a resource data sync for
       a Region, you can't change the account options for that sync. For exam-
       ple, if you create a sync in the us-east-2 (Ohio) Region and you choose
       the Include only the current account option, you can't edit  that  sync
       later and choose the Include all accounts from my Organizations config-
       uration option. Instead, you must delete the first resource data  sync,
       and create a new one.

       NOTE:
          This  API operation only supports a resource data sync that was cre-
          ated with a SyncFromSource SyncType .

OPTIONS
       --sync-name (string)
          The name of the resource data sync you want to update.

       --sync-type (string)
          The type of resource data sync. The supported SyncType is  SyncFrom-
          Source.

       --sync-source (structure)
          Specify information about the data sources to synchronize.

          SourceType -> (string)
              The  type  of data source for the resource data sync. SourceType
              is either AwsOrganizations (if an organization is present in Or-
              ganizations) or SingleAccountMultiRegions .

          AwsOrganizationsSource -> (structure)
              Information  about the AwsOrganizationsSource resource data sync
              source. A sync source of this type can synchronize data from Or-
              ganizations.

              OrganizationSourceType -> (string)
                 If  an  Amazon  Web Services organization is present, this is
                 either OrganizationalUnits or EntireOrganization . For  Orga-
                 nizationalUnits  , the data is aggregated from a set of orga-
                 nization units. For EntireOrganization , the data  is  aggre-
                 gated from the entire Amazon Web Services organization.

              OrganizationalUnits -> (list)
                 The Organizations organization units included in the sync.

                 (structure)
                     The Organizations organizational unit data source for the
                     sync.

                     OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
                        The Organizations unit ID data source for the sync.

          SourceRegions -> (list)
              The SyncSource Amazon Web Services Regions included in  the  re-
              source data sync.

              (string)

          IncludeFutureRegions -> (boolean)
              Whether to automatically synchronize and aggregate data from new
              Amazon Web Services Regions when those Regions come online.

          EnableAllOpsDataSources -> (boolean)
              When you create a resource data sync, if you choose one  of  the
              Organizations  options,  then  Systems Manager automatically en-
              ables all OpsData sources in the selected  Amazon  Web  Services
              Regions  for  all Amazon Web Services accounts in your organiza-
              tion (or in the selected organization units). For more  informa-
              tion,  see About multiple account and Region resource data syncs
              in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SourceType": "string",
            "AwsOrganizationsSource": {
              "OrganizationSourceType": "string",
              "OrganizationalUnits": [
                {
                  "OrganizationalUnitId": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            },
            "SourceRegions": ["string", ...],
            "IncludeFutureRegions": true|false,
            "EnableAllOpsDataSources": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a resource data sync

       The following update-resource-data-sync  example  updates  a  SyncFrom-
       Source resource data sync.

          aws ssm update-resource-data-sync \
              --sync-name exampleSync \
              --sync-type SyncFromSource \
              --sync-source '{"SourceType":"SingleAccountMultiRegions", "SourceRegions":["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]}'

       This command produces no output.

       For  more  information, see Setting Up Systems Manager Explorer to Dis-
       play Data from Multiple Accounts and Regions in the AWS Systems Manager
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
