DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-PATCH-STATES()              DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-PATCH-STATES()



NAME
       describe-instance-patch-states -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the high-level patch state of one or more managed nodes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-instance-patch-states  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: InstancePatchStates

OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The ID of the managed node for which patch state information  should
          be retrieved.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          The high-level patch state for the requested managed nodes.

          (structure)
              Defines the high-level patch  compliance  state  for  a  managed
              node, providing information about the number of installed, miss-
              ing, not applicable, and  failed  patches  along  with  metadata
              about  the  operation when this information was gathered for the
              managed node.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the managed node the  high-level  patch  compliance
                 information was collected for.

              PatchGroup -> (string)
                 The name of the patch group the managed node belongs to.

              BaselineId -> (string)
                 The ID of the patch baseline used to patch the managed node.

              SnapshotId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the patch baseline snapshot used during the patch-
                 ing operation when this compliance data was collected.

              InstallOverrideList -> (string)
                 An https URL or an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)
                 path-style  URL  to  a  list of patches to be installed. This
                 patch installation list, which you maintain in an  S3  bucket
                 in  YAML format and specify in the SSM document AWS-RunPatch-
                 Baseline , overrides the patches  specified  by  the  default
                 patch baseline.

                 For more information about the InstallOverrideList parameter,
                 see   About   the   ``AWS-RunPatchBaseline   SSM    document`
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-about-aws-runpatchbaseline.html`__
                 in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

              OwnerInformation -> (string)
                 Placeholder information. This field will always be  empty  in
                 the current release of the service.

              InstalledCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  patches from the patch baseline that are in-
                 stalled on the managed node.

              InstalledOtherCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches not specified  in  the  patch  baseline
                 that are installed on the managed node.

              InstalledPendingRebootCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  patches installed by Patch Manager since the
                 last time the managed node was rebooted.

              InstalledRejectedCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches installed on a managed  node  that  are
                 specified in a RejectedPatches list. Patches with a status of
                 InstalledRejected were typically installed before  they  were
                 added to a RejectedPatches list.

                 NOTE:
                     If  ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY  is  the specified option for Re-
                     jectedPatchesAction , the value of InstalledRejectedCount
                     will always be 0 (zero).

              MissingCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches from the patch baseline that are appli-
                 cable for the managed node but aren't currently installed.

              FailedCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches from the patch baseline that  were  at-
                 tempted  to  be installed during the last patching operation,
                 but failed to install.

              UnreportedNotApplicableCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches beyond the supported limit of NotAppli-
                 cableCount  that aren't reported by name to Inventory. Inven-
                 tory is a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

              NotApplicableCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches from the patch baseline that aren't ap-
                 plicable  for the managed node and therefore aren't installed
                 on the node. This number may be  truncated  if  the  list  of
                 patch  names is very large. The number of patches beyond this
                 limit are reported in UnreportedNotApplicableCount .

              OperationStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the most recent patching operation  was  started  on
                 the managed node.

              OperationEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time the most recent patching operation completed on the
                 managed node.

              Operation -> (string)
                 The type of patching operation that was performed: or

                 o SCAN assesses the patch compliance state.

                 o INSTALL installs missing patches.

              LastNoRebootInstallOperationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time of the last attempt to patch the managed  node  with
                 NoReboot specified as the reboot option.

              RebootOption -> (string)
                 Indicates the reboot option specified in the patch baseline.

                 NOTE:
                     Reboot  options apply to Install operations only. Reboots
                     aren't attempted for Patch Manager Scan operations.

                 o RebootIfNeeded : Patch Manager tries to reboot the  managed
                   node if it installed any patches, or if any patches are de-
                   tected with a status of InstalledPendingReboot .

                 o NoReboot : Patch Manager attempts to install missing  pack-
                   ages without trying to reboot the system. Patches installed
                   with this option are assigned a status of  InstalledPendin-
                   gReboot  . These patches might not be in effect until a re-
                   boot is performed.

              CriticalNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches per node that are specified as Critical
                 for  compliance  reporting  in  the patch baseline aren't in-
                 stalled. These patches might be missing, have failed  instal-
                 lation,  were  rejected, or were installed but awaiting a re-
                 quired managed node reboot. The status of these managed nodes
                 is NON_COMPLIANT .

              SecurityNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches per node that are specified as Security
                 in a patch advisory aren't installed. These patches might  be
                 missing, have failed installation, were rejected, or were in-
                 stalled but awaiting a required managed node reboot. The sta-
                 tus of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

              OtherNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  patches per node that are specified as other
                 than Critical or Security but aren't compliant with the patch
                 baseline.  The status of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLIANT
                 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use when requesting the next set of items. If there are
          no additional items to return, the string is empty.
