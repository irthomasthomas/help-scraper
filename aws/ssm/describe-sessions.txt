DESCRIBE-SESSIONS()                                        DESCRIBE-SESSIONS()



NAME
       describe-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of  all active sessions (both connected and discon-
       nected) or terminated sessions from the past 30 days.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-sessions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Sessions

OPTIONS
       --state (string)
          The  session status to retrieve a list of sessions for. For example,
          "Active".

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o History

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters to limit the type of sessions  returned  by  the
          request.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for Session Manager information.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              value -> (string)
                 The  filter  value.  Valid  values for each filter key are as
                 follows:

                 o InvokedAfter: Specify a timestamp to  limit  your  results.
                   For  example,  specify 2018-08-29T00:00:00Z to see sessions
                   that started August 29, 2018, and later.

                 o InvokedBefore: Specify a timestamp to limit  your  results.
                   For  example,  specify 2018-08-29T00:00:00Z to see sessions
                   that started before August 29, 2018.

                 o Target: Specify a managed node to which session connections
                   have been made.

                 o Owner: Specify an Amazon Web Services user account to see a
                   list of sessions started by that user.

                 o Status: Specify a valid session status to see a list of all
                   sessions  with  that  status. Status values you can specify
                   include:

                   o Connected

                   o Connecting

                   o Disconnected

                   o Terminated

                   o Terminating

                   o Failed

                 o SessionId: Specify a session ID to return details about the
                   session.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InvokedAfter"|"InvokedBefore"|"Target"|"Owner"|"Status"|"SessionId",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list all active Session Manager sessions

       This describe-sessions example retrieves a list of the active  sessions
       created  most  recently (both connected and disconnected sessions) over
       the past 30 days that were started by the specified user. This  command
       returns only results for connections to targets initiated using Session
       Manager. It does not list connections made through other means, such as
       Remote Desktop Connections or SSH.

          aws ssm describe-sessions \
              --state "Active" \
              --filters "key=Owner,value=arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/Administrator/Shirley-Rodriguez"

       Output:

          {
              "Sessions": [
                  {
                      "SessionId": "John-07a16060613c408b5",
                      "Target": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
                      "Status": "Connected",
                      "StartDate": 1550676938.352,
                      "Owner": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/Administrator/Shirley-Rodriguez",
                      "OutputUrl": {}
                  },
                  {
                      "SessionId": "John-01edf534b8b56e8eb",
                      "Target": "i-9876543210abcdef0",
                      "Status": "Connected",
                      "StartDate": 1550676842.194,
                      "Owner": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/Administrator/Shirley-Rodriguez",
                      "OutputUrl": {}
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To list all terminated Session Manager sessions

       This  describe-sessions  example  retrieves a list of the most recently
       terminated sessions from the past 30 days for all users.

          aws ssm describe-sessions \
              --state "History"

       Output:

          {
              "Sessions": [
                  {
                      "SessionId": "Mary-Major-0022b1eb2b0d9e3bd",
                      "Target": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
                      "Status": "Terminated",
                      "StartDate": 1550520701.256,
                      "EndDate": 1550521931.563,
                      "Owner": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/Administrator/Mary-Major"
                  },
                  {
                      "SessionId": "Jane-Roe-0db53f487931ed9d4",
                      "Target": "i-9876543210abcdef0",
                      "Status": "Terminated",

                      "EndDate": 1550162580.329,
                      "Owner": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/Administrator/Jane-Roe"
                  },
                  ...
              ],
