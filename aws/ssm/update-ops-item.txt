OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          Update the information about the OpsItem. Provide enough information
          so that users reading this OpsItem for the first time understand the
          issue.

       --operational-data (map)
          Add new keys or edit existing key-value pairs of the OperationalData
          map in the OpsItem object.

          Operational  data  is custom data that provides useful reference de-
          tails about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, er-
          ror  strings,  license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant
          data. You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key  has  a
          maximum length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20
          KB.

          WARNING:
              Operational data keys can't begin with the following:  amazon  ,
              aws , amzn , ssm , /amazon , /aws , /amzn , /ssm .

          You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the ac-
          count or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means  that
          all  users  with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by
          the  DescribeOpsItems API operation) can  view  and  search  on  the
          specified data. Operational data that isn't searchable is only view-
          able by users who have access to the OpsItem  (as  provided  by  the
          GetOpsItem API operation).

          Use  the  /aws/resources key in OperationalData to specify a related
          resource in the request. Use  the  /aws/automations  key  in  Opera-
          tionalData  to  associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem. To
          view Amazon Web Services CLI example commands that use  these  keys,
          see  Creating  OpsItems  manually in the Amazon Web Services Systems
          Manager User Guide .

       To update an OpsItem

       The  following  update-ops-item example updates the description, prior-

       SNS  topic where the notifications are sent when this OpsItem is edited
       or changed.

              --ops-item-id "oi-287b5EXAMPLE" \
              --description "Primary OpsItem for failover event 2020-01-01-fh398yf" \
              --priority 2 \
              --category "Security" \
