OPTIONS
       --document-name (string)
          The  name of the Automation runbook to run. The result of the execu-
          tion preview indicates what the impact would be of running this run-
          book.

       --document-version (string)
          The  version  of the Automation runbook to run. The default value is
          $DEFAULT .

       --execution-inputs (tagged union structure)
          Information about the inputs that can be specified for  the  preview
          operation.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: Automation.

          Automation -> (structure)
              Information about the optional inputs that can be specified  for
              an automation execution preview.

              Parameters -> (map)
                 Information  about  parameters  that can be specified for the
                 preview operation.

                 value -> (list)

              Targets -> (list)
                 Information about the resources that would be included in the

                     using a key-value pair that you specify.

                     NOTE:
                        One or more targets must be specified for  maintenance
                        window  Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the task,
                        targets are optional for other maintenance window task

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,

                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
