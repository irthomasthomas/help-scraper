NAME
       describe-maintenance-windows-for-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  the  maintenance window targets or tasks
       that a managed node is associated with.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-maintenance-windows-for-target is a paginated operation.  Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: WindowIdentities

OPTIONS
       --targets (list)
          The managed node ID or key-value pair to retrieve information about.

          (structure)
              An  array  of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a
              key-value pair that you specify.

              NOTE:
                 One or more targets must be specified for maintenance  window
                 Run  Command-type  tasks.  Depending on the task, targets are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda,  and Step Functions). For more information about run-
                 ning tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering  main-
                 tenance  window  tasks without targets in the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

              Supported formats include the following.

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<in-
                stance-id-3>

              o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Values=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

              o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

              o Run  Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets only : Key=re-
                source-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

              o Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=resource-groups:Re-
                sourceTypeFilters,Values=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

              o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup;Values=<re-
                source-group-name>

              For example:

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE,i-0471e04240EXAM-
                PLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

              o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCenter3

              o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

              o Run  Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets only : Key=re-
                source-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup   This exam-
                ple  demonstrates  how to target all resources in the resource
                group ProductionResourceGroup in your maintenance window.

              o Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=resource-groups:Re-
                sourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC
                This example demonstrates how to target  only  Amazon  Elastic
                Compute  Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in your mainte-
                nance window.

              o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyResource-
                Group

              o State  Manager association targets only : Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=*   This example demonstrates how to  target  all  managed
                instances in the Amazon Web Services Region where the associa-
                tion was created.

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged  nodes  using  Key,Value parameters, see Targeting multiple
              managed nodes in the Amazon Web Services  Systems  Manager  User
              Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined  criteria  for sending commands that target man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For example, if  you
                 specified  tag:ServerRole , you could specify value:WebServer
                 to run a command  on  instances  that  include  EC2  tags  of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --resource-type (string)
          The type of resource you want to retrieve information about. For ex-
          ample, INSTANCE .

          Possible values:

          o INSTANCE

          o RESOURCE_GROUP

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list all maintenance windows associated with a specific instance

       The following describe-maintenance-windows-for-target example lists the
       maintenance  windows  that  have  targets  or tasks associated with the
       specified instance.
