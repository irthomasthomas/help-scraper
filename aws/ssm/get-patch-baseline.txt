OPTIONS
       --baseline-id (string)
          The ID of the patch baseline to retrieve.

          NOTE:
              To  retrieve  information  about  an Amazon Web Services managed
              patch baseline, specify the full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of
              the  baseline.  For example, for the baseline AWS-AmazonLinuxDe-
              faultPatchBaseline                   ,                   specify
              arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:733109147000:patchbase-
              line/pb-0e392de35e7c563b7 instead of pb-0e392de35e7c563b7 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       BaselineId -> (string)
          The ID of the retrieved patch baseline.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the patch baseline.

       OperatingSystem -> (string)
          Returns the operating system specified for the patch baseline.

       GlobalFilters -> (structure)
          A set of global filters used to exclude patches from the baseline.

          PatchFilters -> (list)
              The set of patch filters that make up the group.

              (structure)
                 Defines which patches should be included in a patch baseline.

                 A patch filter consists of a key and a  set  of  values.  The
                 filter  key  is  a patch property. For example, the available
                 filter keys for WINDOWS  are  PATCH_SET  ,  PRODUCT  ,  PROD-
                 UCT_FAMILY , CLASSIFICATION , and MSRC_SEVERITY .

                 The  filter  values define a matching criterion for the patch
                 property indicated by the key. For example, if the filter key
                 is  PRODUCT and the filter values are ["Office 2013", "Office
                 2016"] , then the filter accepts all  patches  where  product
                 name  is  either  "Office  2013" or "Office 2016". The filter
                 values can be exact values for the patch property given as  a
                 key, or a wildcard (*), which matches all values.

                 You  can  view lists of valid values for the patch properties
                 by running the DescribePatchProperties command. For  informa-
                 tion about which patch properties can be used with each major
                 operating system, see  DescribePatchProperties .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key for the filter.

                     Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of
                     valid keys for each operating system type.

                 Values -> (list)
                     The value for the filter key.

                     Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of
                     valid values for each key based on operating system type.

                     (string)

       ApprovalRules -> (structure)
          A set of rules used to include patches in the baseline.

          PatchRules -> (list)
              The rules that make up the rule group.

              (structure)
                 Defines an approval rule for a patch baseline.

                 PatchFilterGroup -> (structure)
                     The patch filter group that defines the criteria for  the
                     rule.

                     PatchFilters -> (list)
                        The set of patch filters that make up the group.

                        (structure)
                            Defines  which  patches  should  be  included in a
                            patch baseline.

                            A patch filter consists of a key and a set of val-
                            ues. The filter key is a patch property. For exam-
                            ple, the available filter  keys  for  WINDOWS  are
                            PATCH_SET , PRODUCT , PRODUCT_FAMILY , CLASSIFICA-
                            TION , and MSRC_SEVERITY .

                            The filter values define a matching criterion  for
                            the patch property indicated by the key. For exam-
                            ple, if the filter key is PRODUCT and  the  filter
                            values  are  ["Office 2013", "Office 2016"] , then
                            the filter accepts all patches where product  name
                            is either "Office 2013" or "Office 2016". The fil-
                            ter values can be exact values for the patch prop-
                            erty  given  as  a  key,  or a wildcard (*), which
                            matches all values.

                            You can view lists of valid values for  the  patch
                            properties  by running the DescribePatchProperties
                            command. For information about which patch proper-
                            ties can be used with each major operating system,
                            see  DescribePatchProperties .

                            Key -> (string)
                               The key for the filter.

                               Run  the   DescribePatchProperties  command  to
                               view  lists  of  valid  keys for each operating
                               system type.

                            Values -> (list)
                               The value for the filter key.

                               Run  the   DescribePatchProperties  command  to
                               view  lists  of valid values for each key based
                               on operating system type.

                               (string)

                 ComplianceLevel -> (string)
                     A compliance severity level for all approved patches in a
                     patch baseline.

                 ApproveAfterDays -> (integer)
                     The  number  of days after the release date of each patch
                     matched by the rule that the patch is marked as  approved
                     in  the  patch  baseline. For example, a value of 7 means
                     that patches are approved seven days after they  are  re-
                     leased.

                     This  parameter  is marked as Required: No , but your re-
                     quest must include a value for either ApproveAfterDays or
                     ApproveUntilDate .

                     Not supported for Debian Server or Ubuntu Server.

                     WARNING:
                        Use caution when setting this value for Windows Server
                        patch baselines. Because patch updates  that  are  re-
                        placed by later updates are removed, setting too broad
                        a value for  this  parameter  can  result  in  crucial
                        patches not being installed. For more information, see
