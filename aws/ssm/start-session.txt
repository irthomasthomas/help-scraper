START-SESSION()                                                START-SESSION()



NAME
       start-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates  a connection to a target (for example, a managed node) for a
       Session Manager session. Returns a URL and token that can  be  used  to
       open a WebSocket connection for sending input and receiving outputs.

       NOTE:
          Amazon  Web Services CLI usage: start-session is an interactive com-
          mand that requires the Session Manager plugin to be installed on the
          client  machine  making  the  call. For information, see Install the
          Session Manager plugin for the Amazon Web Services CLI in the Amazon
          Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

          Amazon  Web  Services  Tools  for PowerShell usage: Start-SSMSession
          isn't currently supported by Amazon Web Services  Tools  for  Power-
          Shell on Windows local machines.

OPTIONS
       --target (string)
          The managed node to connect to for the session.

       --document-name (string)
          The  name  of the SSM document you want to use to define the type of
          session, input parameters, or preferences for the session. For exam-
          ple,  SSM-SessionManagerRunShell . You can call the  GetDocument API
          to verify the document exists before attempting to start a  session.
          If  no  document  name  is  provided, a shell to the managed node is
          launched by default. For more information, see Start  a  session  in
          the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       --reason (string)
          The reason for connecting to the instance. This value is included in
          the details for the Amazon CloudWatch Events event created when  you
          start the session.

       --parameters (map)
          The  values  you  want  to specify for the parameters defined in the
          Session document.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To start a Session Manager session

       This  start-session  example  establishes a connection with an instance
       for a Session Manager session. Note that this interactive  command  re-
       quires the Session Manager plugin to be installed on the client machine
       making the call.

          aws ssm start-session \
              --target "i-1234567890abcdef0"

       Output:

          Starting session with SessionId: Jane-Roe-07a16060613c408b5

       Example 2: To start a Session Manager session using SSH

       This start-session example establishes a connection  with  an  instance
       for  a  Session  Manager  session using SSH. Note that this interactive
       command requires the Session Manager plugin  to  be  installed  on  the
       client  machine  making the call, and that the command uses the default
       user on the instance, such as ec2-user for EC2 instances for Linux.

          ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE

       Output:

          Starting session with SessionId: ec2-user-07a16060613c408b5

       For more information, see Start a Session and Install the Session  Man-
       ager Plugin for the AWS CLI in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
