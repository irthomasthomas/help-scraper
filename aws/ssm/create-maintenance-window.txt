CREATE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW()                        CREATE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW()



NAME
       create-maintenance-window -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new maintenance window.

       NOTE:
          The  value you specify for Duration determines the specific end time
          for the maintenance window based on the time it begins.  No  mainte-
          nance  window  tasks are permitted to start after the resulting end-
          time minus the number of hours you specify for Cutoff . For example,
          if  the  maintenance  window  starts  at 3 PM, the duration is three
          hours, and the value you specify for Cutoff is one hour, no  mainte-
          nance window tasks can start after 5 PM.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the maintenance window.

       --description (string)
          An  optional  description  for  the maintenance window. We recommend
          specifying a description to help you organize your maintenance  win-
          dows.

       --start-date (string)
          The  date  and  time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want
          the maintenance window to become active. StartDate allows you to de-
          lay  activation of the maintenance window until the specified future
          date.

          NOTE:
              When using a rate schedule, if you provide a start date that oc-
              curs  in  the  past,  the  current date and time are used as the
              start date.

       --end-date (string)
          The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for  when  you  want
          the maintenance window to become inactive. EndDate allows you to set
          a date and time in the future when the maintenance  window  will  no
          longer run.

       --schedule (string)
          The schedule of the maintenance window in the form of a cron or rate
          expression.

       --schedule-timezone (string)
          The time zone that the scheduled maintenance window  executions  are
          based  on, in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) format. For
          example: "America/Los_Angeles", "UTC", or "Asia/Seoul". For more in-
          formation, see the Time Zone Database on the IANA website.

       --schedule-offset (integer)
          The  number  of  days to wait after the date and time specified by a
          cron expression before running the maintenance window.

          For example, the following cron expression schedules  a  maintenance
          window to run on the third Tuesday of every month at 11:30 PM.
              cron(30 23 ? * TUE#3 *)

          If the schedule offset is 2 , the maintenance window won't run until
          two days later.

       --duration (integer)
          The duration of the maintenance window in hours.

       --cutoff (integer)
          The number of hours before the end of the  maintenance  window  that
          Amazon  Web  Services Systems Manager stops scheduling new tasks for
          execution.

       --allow-unassociated-targets |  --no-allow-unassociated-targets  (bool-
       ean)
          Enables  a  maintenance window task to run on managed nodes, even if
          you haven't registered those nodes as targets. If enabled, then  you
          must  specify  the  unregistered managed nodes (by node ID) when you
          register a task with the maintenance window.

          If you don't enable  this  option,  then  you  must  specify  previ-
          ously-registered  targets  when you register a task with the mainte-
          nance window.

       --client-token (string)
          User-provided idempotency token.

       --tags (list)
          Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you  to
          categorize  a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner,
          or environment. For example, you might want  to  tag  a  maintenance
          window  to identify the type of tasks it will run, the types of tar-
          gets, and the environment it will run in. In this  case,  you  could
          specify the following key-value pairs:

          o Key=TaskType,Value=AgentUpdate

          o Key=OS,Value=Windows

          o Key=Environment,Value=Production

          NOTE:
              To  add tags to an existing maintenance window, use the  AddTag-
              sToResource operation.

          (structure)
              Metadata that you assign to your Amazon Web Services  resources.
              Tags  enable you to categorize your resources in different ways,
              for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.  In  Amazon  Web
              Services  Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems Manager
              documents (SSM documents), managed nodes,  maintenance  windows,
              parameters, patch baselines, OpsItems, and OpsMetadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a maintenance window

       The following create-maintenance-window example creates a  new  mainte-
       nance  window  that every five minutes for up to two hours (as needed),
       prevents new tasks from starting within one hour  of  the  end  of  the
       maintenance  window  execution,  allows unassociated targets (instances
       that you haven't registered with the maintenance window), and indicates
       through  the use of custom tags that its creator intends to use it in a
       tutorial.

          aws ssm create-maintenance-window \
              --name "My-Tutorial-Maintenance-Window" \
              --schedule "rate(5 minutes)" \
              --duration 2 --cutoff 1 \
              --allow-unassociated-targets \
              --tags "Key=Purpose,Value=Tutorial"

       Output:

          {
              "WindowId": "mw-0c50858d01EXAMPLE"
          }

       Example 2: To create a maintenance window that runs only once

       The following create-maintenance-window example creates a  new  mainte-
       nance window that only runs one time on the specified date and time.

          aws ssm create-maintenance-window \
              --name My-One-Time-Maintenance-Window \
              --schedule "at(2020-05-14T15:55:00)" \
              --duration 5 \
              --cutoff 2 \
              --allow-unassociated-targets \
              --tags "Key=Environment,Value=Production"

       Output:

          {
              "WindowId": "mw-01234567890abcdef"
          }

       For  more  information, see Maintenance Windows in the AWS Systems Man-
       ager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       WindowId -> (string)
          The ID of the created maintenance window.
