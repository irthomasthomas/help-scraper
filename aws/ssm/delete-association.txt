DELETE-ASSOCIATION()                                      DELETE-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       delete-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  the  specified Amazon Web Services Systems Manager docu-
       ment (SSM document) from the specified managed node. If you created the
       association  by  using  the Targets parameter, then you must delete the
       association by using the association ID.

       When you disassociate a document from a managed node, it doesn't change
       the  configuration  of the node. To change the configuration state of a
       managed node after you disassociate a document, you must create  a  new
       document with the desired configuration and associate it with the node.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the SSM document.

       --instance-id (string)
          The managed node ID.

          NOTE:
              InstanceId has been deprecated. To specify a managed node ID for
              an association, use the Targets parameter. Requests that include
              the  parameter  InstanceID  with  Systems Manager documents (SSM
              documents) that use schema version 2.0 or later  will  fail.  In
              addition,  if  you  use the parameter InstanceId , you can't use
              the parameters AssociationName , DocumentVersion ,  MaxErrors  ,
              MaxConcurrency , OutputLocation , or ScheduleExpression . To use
              these parameters, you must use the Targets parameter.

       --association-id (string)
          The association ID that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To delete an association using the association ID

       The following delete-association example deletes  the  association  for
       the  specified  association  ID. There is no output if the command suc-
       ceeds.

          aws ssm delete-association \
              --association-id "8dfe3659-4309-493a-8755-0123456789ab"

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Editing and creating a new version of an  as-
       sociation in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

       Example 2: To delete an association

       The  following  delete-association  example deletes the association be-
       tween an instance and a document. There is no  output  if  the  command
       succeeds.

          aws ssm delete-association \
              --instance-id "i-1234567890abcdef0" \
              --name "AWS-UpdateSSMAgent"

       This command produces no output.

       in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
