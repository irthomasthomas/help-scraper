NAME
       describe-instance-information -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information about one or more of your managed nodes, including
       the operating system platform, SSM Agent version,  association  status,
       and  IP  address.  This operation does not return information for nodes
       that are either Stopped or Terminated.

       If you specify one or more node IDs, the operation returns  information
       for  those managed nodes. If you don't specify node IDs, it returns in-
       formation for all your managed nodes. If you specify  a  node  ID  that
       isn't valid or a node that you don't own, you receive an error.

       NOTE:
          The  IamRole  field  returned for this API operation is the role as-
          signed to an Amazon EC2 instance configured with a  Systems  Manager
          Quick Setup host management configuration or the role assigned to an
          on-premises managed node.

       describe-instance-information is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: InstanceInformationList

OPTIONS
       --instance-information-filter-list (list)
          This  is  a  legacy  method.  We  recommend  that you don't use this
          method. Instead, use the Filters data type. Filters enables  you  to
          return  node  information by filtering based on tags applied to man-
          aged nodes.

          NOTE:
              Attempting  to  use  InstanceInformationFilterList  and  Filters
              leads to an exception error.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for a specific list of managed nodes. You can
              filter node information by using tags. You specify tags by using
              a key-value mapping.

              Use  this operation instead of the  DescribeInstanceInformation-
              Request$InstanceInformationFilterList method. The InstanceInfor-
              mationFilterList  method  is a legacy method and doesn't support
              tags.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              valueSet -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,valueSet=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InstanceIds"|"AgentVersion"|"PingStatus"|"PlatformTypes"|"ActivationIds"|"IamRole"|"ResourceType"|"AssociationStatus",
              "valueSet": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list  of
          managed  nodes. You can filter based on tags applied to your managed
          nodes. Tag filters can't be combined with other  filter  types.  Use
          this  Filters  data  type instead of InstanceInformationFilterList ,
          which is deprecated.

          (structure)
              The filters to describe or get information  about  your  managed
              nodes.

              Key -> (string)
                 The filter key name to describe your managed nodes.

                 Valid filter key values: ActivationIds | AgentVersion | Asso-
                 ciationStatus | IamRole | InstanceIds |  PingStatus  |  Plat-
                 formTypes   |   ResourceType  |  SourceIds  |  SourceTypes  |
                 "tag-key" | "tag:{keyname}

                 o Valid values for the AssociationStatus filter key:  Success
                   | Pending | Failed

                 o Valid  values  for the PingStatus filter key: Online | Con-
                   nectionLost | Inactive (deprecated)

                 o Valid values for the PlatformType  filter  key:  Windows  |
                   Linux | MacOS

                 o Valid values for the ResourceType filter key: EC2Instance |
                   ManagedInstance

                 o Valid values for the SourceType filter  key:  AWS::EC2::In-
                   stance | AWS::SSM::ManagedInstance | AWS::IoT::Thing

                 o Valid    tag    examples:    Key=tag-key,Values=Purpose   |
                   Key=tag:Purpose,Values=Test .

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 This  call  doesn't  return the IAM role for unmanaged Amazon
                 EC2 instances (instances not configured for Systems Manager).
                 To  retrieve the role for an unmanaged instance, use the Ama-
                 zon EC2 DescribeInstances  operation.  For  information,  see
                 DescribeInstances   in   the  Amazon  EC2  API  Reference  or
                 describe-instances in the Amazon  Web  Services  CLI  Command

                 The  name  assigned to an on-premises server, edge device, or
                 virtual machine (VM) when it is activated as a  Systems  Man-
                 ager  managed  node.  The name is specified as the DefaultIn-
                 stanceName property using the  CreateActivation  command.  It
                 is  applied  to the managed node by specifying the Activation
                 Code and Activation ID when you  install  SSM  Agent  on  the
                 node,  as  explained  in  How  to install SSM Agent on hybrid
                 Linux nodes and How to install SSM Agent  on  hybrid  Windows
                 Server  nodes  . To retrieve the Name tag of an EC2 instance,
                 use the Amazon EC2 DescribeInstances operation. For  informa-
                 tion,  see  DescribeInstances in the Amazon EC2 API Reference

              LastAssociationExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the association was last run.

              LastSuccessfulAssociationExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The last date the association was successfully run.

              AssociationOverview -> (structure)
                 Information about the association.

                 DetailedStatus -> (string)
