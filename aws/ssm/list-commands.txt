LIST-COMMANDS()                                                LIST-COMMANDS()



NAME
       list-commands -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  commands  requested by users of the Amazon Web Services ac-
       count.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-commands is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Commands

OPTIONS
       --command-id (string)
          (Optional) If provided, lists only the specified command.

       --instance-id (string)
          (Optional) Lists commands issued against this managed node ID.

          NOTE:
              You can't specify a managed node ID in the same command that you
              specify Status = Pending . This is because  the  command  hasn't
              reached the managed node yet.

       --filters (list)
          (Optional)  One  or more filters. Use a filter to return a more spe-
          cific list of results.

          (structure)
              Describes a command filter.

              NOTE:
                 A managed node ID can't be specified when a command status is
                 Pending because the command hasn't run on the node yet.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 NOTE:
                     The ExecutionStage filter can't be used with the ListCom-
                     mandInvocations operation, only with ListCommands .

              value -> (string)
                 The filter value. Valid values for each  filter  key  are  as
                 follows:

                 o InvokedAfter  :  Specify a timestamp to limit your results.
                   For example, specify 2024-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list  of
                   command executions occurring July 7, 2021, and later.

                 o InvokedBefore  : Specify a timestamp to limit your results.
                   For example, specify 2024-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list  of
                   command executions from before July 7, 2021.

                 o Status  :  Specify  a valid command status to see a list of
                   all command executions with that status. The status choices
                   depend on the API you call. The status values you can spec-
                   ify for ListCommands are:

                   o Pending

                   o InProgress

                   o Success

                   o Cancelled

                   o Failed

                   o TimedOut (this includes both Delivery and Execution  time
                     outs)

                   o AccessDenied

                   o DeliveryTimedOut

                   o ExecutionTimedOut

                   o Incomplete

                   o NoInstancesInTag

                   o LimitExceeded

                 The  status values you can specify for ListCommandInvocations
                 are:

                     o Pending

                     o InProgress

                     o Delayed

                     o Success

                     o Cancelled

                     o Failed

                     o TimedOut (this includes  both  Delivery  and  Execution
                       time outs)

                     o AccessDenied

                     o DeliveryTimedOut

                     o ExecutionTimedOut

                     o Undeliverable

                     o InvalidPlatform

                     o Terminated

                 o DocumentName : Specify name of the Amazon Web Services Sys-
                   tems Manager document (SSM document) for which you want  to
                   see   command   execution  results.  For  example,  specify
                   AWS-RunPatchBaseline to see command  executions  that  used
                   this  SSM  document to perform security patching operations
                   on managed nodes.

                 o ExecutionStage : Specify one of the following values (List-
                   Commands operations only):

                   o Executing : Returns a list of command executions that are
                     currently still running.

                   o Complete : Returns a list of command executions that have
                     already completed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InvokedAfter"|"InvokedBefore"|"Status"|"ExecutionStage"|"DocumentName",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To get the status of a specific command

       The following list-commands example retrieves and displays  the  status
       of the specified command.

              --command-id "0831e1a8-a1ac-4257-a1fd-c831bEXAMPLE"

       Example  2:  To  get  the status of commands requested after a specific
       date

       The following list-commands example retrieves the details  of  commands
       requested after the specified date.

          aws ssm list-commands \
              --filter "key=InvokedAfter,value=2020-02-01T00:00:00Z"

       Example 3: To list all commands requested in an AWS account

       The  following  list-commands  example  lists all commands requested by
       users in the current AWS account and Region.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get   managed   nodes  using  Key,Value  parameters,  see
                     Targeting multiple managed nodes in the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                     vices Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For  example,
                        if  you  specified  tag:ServerRole , you could specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values for a key might be lower than the global  maxi-
                        mum of 50.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the command.

              StatusDetails -> (string)
                 A detailed status of the command execution. StatusDetails in-
                 cludes more  information  than  Status  because  it  includes
                 states  resulting  from error and concurrency control parame-
                 ters. StatusDetails can show different results  than  Status.
                 For  more information about these statuses, see Understanding
                 command statuses in the Amazon Web Services  Systems  Manager
                 User  Guide  . StatusDetails can be one of the following val-
                 ues:

                 o Pending: The command hasn't been sent to any managed nodes.

                 o In Progress: The command has been sent to at least one man-
                   aged  node  but hasn't reached a final state on all managed
                   nodes.

                 o Success: The command successfully ran on  all  invocations.
                   This is a terminal state.

                 o Delivery  Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command
                   invocations shows a status of Delivery Timed Out. This is a
                   terminal state.

                 o Execution Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command
                   invocations shows a status of Execution Timed Out. This  is
                   a terminal state.

                 o Failed:  The value of MaxErrors or more command invocations
                   shows a status of Failed. This is a terminal state.

                 o Incomplete: The command was attempted on all managed  nodes
                   and one or more invocations doesn't have a value of Success
                   but not enough invocations failed  for  the  status  to  be
                   Failed. This is a terminal state.

                 o Cancelled:  The  command  was terminated before it was com-
                   pleted. This is a terminal state.

                 o Rate Exceeded: The number of managed nodes targeted by  the
                   command exceeded the account limit for pending invocations.
                   The system has canceled the command before  running  it  on
                   any managed node. This is a terminal state.

                 o Delayed:  The  system  attempted to send the command to the
                   managed node but  wasn't  successful.  The  system  retries
                   again.

              OutputS3Region -> (string)
                 (Deprecated)  You  can  no longer specify this parameter. The
                 system ignores it. Instead, Systems Manager automatically de-

                 mand.

              OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                 The  S3  directory path inside the bucket where the responses
                 to the command executions should  be  stored.  This  was  re-
                 quested when issuing the command.

              MaxConcurrency -> (string)
                 The  maximum  number of managed nodes that are allowed to run
                 the command at the same time. You can  specify  a  number  of
                 managed  nodes, such as 10, or a percentage of nodes, such as
                 10%. The default value is 50. For more information about  how
                 to  use MaxConcurrency , see Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
                 ager Run Command in the Amazon Web Services  Systems  Manager
                 User Guide .

              MaxErrors -> (string)
                 The  maximum number of errors allowed before the system stops
                 sending the command to additional targets. You can specify  a
                 number of errors, such as 10, or a percentage or errors, such
                 as 10%. The default value is 0 . For more  information  about
                 how  to  use MaxErrors , see Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
                 ager Run Command in the Amazon Web Services  Systems  Manager
