OPTIONS
       --membership-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the membership.

       --query-log-status (string)
          An  indicator  as  to whether query logging has been enabled or dis-
          abled for the membership.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --default-result-configuration (structure)
          The default protected query result configuration as specified by the
          member who can receive results.

          outputConfiguration -> (tagged union structure)
              Configuration for protected query results.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following
                 top level keys can be set: s3.

              s3 -> (structure)
                 Contains the configuration to write the query results to S3.

                 resultFormat -> (string)
                     Intended file format of the result.

                 bucket -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket to unload the protected query results.

                 keyPrefix -> (string)
                     The S3 prefix to unload the protected query results.

                 singleFileOutput -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether files should be output as a single file
                     (TRUE ) or output as multiple files (FALSE ). This param-
                     eter is only supported for analyses with the  Spark  ana-
                     lytics engine.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  unique  ARN  for an IAM role that is used by Clean Rooms to
              write protected query results to the result location,  given  by
              the member who can receive results.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          outputConfiguration={s3={resultFormat=string,bucket=string,keyPrefix=string,singleFileOutput=boolean}},roleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "outputConfiguration": {
              "s3": {
                "resultFormat": "CSV"|"PARQUET",
                "bucket": "string",
                "keyPrefix": "string",
                "singleFileOutput": true|false
              }
            },
            "roleArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
