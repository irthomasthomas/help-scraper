NAME
       create-privacy-budget-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a privacy budget template for a specified membership. Each mem-
       bership can have only one  privacy  budget  template,  but  it  can  be
       deleted  and  recreated.  If you need to change the privacy budget tem-
       plate for a membership, use the  UpdatePrivacyBudgetTemplate operation.

OPTIONS
       --membership-identifier (string)
          A unique identifier for one of your memberships for a collaboration.
          The  privacy  budget  template  is created in the collaboration that
          this membership belongs to. Accepts a membership ID.

       --auto-refresh (string)
          How often the privacy budget refreshes.

          WARNING:
              If you plan to regularly bring new data into the  collaboration,
              you  can  use  CALENDAR_MONTH to automatically get a new privacy
              budget for the collaboration every calendar month. Choosing this
              option  allows  arbitrary  amounts of information to be revealed
              about rows of the data when repeatedly queries across refreshes.
              Avoid  choosing this if the same rows will be repeatedly queried
              between privacy budget refreshes.

          Possible values:

          o CALENDAR_MONTH

          o NONE

       --privacy-budget-type (string)
          Specifies the type of the privacy budget template.

          Possible values:

          o DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY

       --parameters (tagged union structure)
          Specifies your parameters for the privacy budget template.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: differentialPrivacy.

          differentialPrivacy -> (structure)
              An object that specifies the epsilon and noise parameters.

              epsilon -> (integer)
                 The epsilon value that you want to use.

              usersNoisePerQuery -> (integer)
                 Noise  added  per query is measured in terms of the number of
                 users whose contributions you want  to  obscure.  This  value
                 governs the rate at which the privacy budget is depleted.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          differentialPrivacy={epsilon=integer,usersNoisePerQuery=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "differentialPrivacy": {
              "epsilon": integer,
              "usersNoisePerQuery": integer
            }
          }

       --tags (map)
          An  optional label that you can assign to a resource when you create
          it. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of  which
          you  define. When you use tagging, you can also use tag-based access
          control in IAM policies to control access to this resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 tion, use CALENDAR_MONTH to automatically get a  new  privacy
                 budget  for  the collaboration every calendar month. Choosing

                 vealed  about rows of the data when repeatedly queried across
