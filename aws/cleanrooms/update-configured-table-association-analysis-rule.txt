          sociation belongs to. Currently accepts the membership ID.

       --configured-table-association-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the configured table association to update.

       --analysis-rule-policy (tagged union structure)
          The updated analysis rule policy for the congured table association.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: v1.

          v1 -> (tagged union structure)
              The policy for the configured table association analysis rule.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following
                 top level keys can be set: list, aggregation, custom.

              list -> (structure)
                 Analysis rule type that enables only list queries on  a  con-
                 figured table.

                 allowedResultReceivers -> (list)
                     The  list of collaboration members who are allowed to re-

              aggregation -> (structure)
                 Analysis rule type that enables only aggregation queries on a

                     lowed to perform additional analysis on query output.

                     The allowedAdditionalAnalyses parameter is currently sup-
                     ported for the list analysis rule (AnalysisRuleList ) and

                 differential privacy.

                 allowedResultReceivers -> (list)
                     The list of collaboration members who are allowed to  re-

          {
            "v1": {
              "list": {
                "allowedResultReceivers": ["string", ...],
                "allowedAdditionalAnalyses": ["string", ...]
              },
              "aggregation": {
                "allowedResultReceivers": ["string", ...],
                "allowedAdditionalAnalyses": ["string", ...]
              },
              "custom": {
                "allowedResultReceivers": ["string", ...],
                "allowedAdditionalAnalyses": ["string", ...]
              }
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)
