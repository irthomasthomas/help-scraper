OPTIONS
       --membership-identifier (string)
          A unique identifier for one of your memberships for a collaboration.
          Accepts a membership ID.

       --parameters (tagged union structure)
          Specifies the desired epsilon and noise parameters to preview.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: differentialPrivacy.

          differentialPrivacy -> (structure)
              An array that specifies the epsilon and noise parameters.

              epsilon -> (integer)
                 The epsilon value that you want to preview.

              usersNoisePerQuery -> (integer)
                 Noise added per query is measured in terms of the  number  of
                 users  whose  contributions  you  want to obscure. This value
                 governs the rate at which the privacy budget is depleted.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          differentialPrivacy={epsilon=integer,usersNoisePerQuery=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "differentialPrivacy": {
              "epsilon": integer,
              "usersNoisePerQuery": integer
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       privacyImpact -> (tagged union structure)
          An  estimate  of the number of aggregation functions that the member
          who can query can run given the epsilon and noise  parameters.  This
          does not change the privacy budget.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: differentialPrivacy.

          differentialPrivacy -> (structure)
              An object that lists the number and type  of  aggregation  func-
              tions you can perform.

              aggregations -> (list)
                 The number of aggregation functions that you can perform.

                 (structure)
                     Provides  an  estimate of the number of aggregation func-
                     tions that the member who can query can run given the ep-
                     silon and noise parameters.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of aggregation function.

                     maxCount -> (integer)
                        The maximum number of aggregations that the member who
                        can query can run given the epsilon and noise  parame-
                        ters.
