OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the configured table.

       --description (string)
          A description for the configured table.

       --table-reference (tagged union structure)
          A reference to the Glue table being configured.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: glue.

          glue -> (structure)
              If present, a reference to the Glue table referred  to  by  this
              table reference.

              tableName -> (string)
                 The name of the Glue table.

              databaseName -> (string)
                 The name of the database the Glue table belongs to.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          glue={tableName=string,databaseName=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "glue": {
              "tableName": "string",
              "databaseName": "string"
            }
          }

       --allowed-columns (list)
          The  columns  of the underlying table that can be used by collabora-
          tions or analysis rules.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --analysis-method (string)
          The analysis method for the configured tables. The only valid  value
          is currently DIRECT_QUERY.

          Possible values:

          o DIRECT_QUERY

       --tags (map)
          An  optional label that you can assign to a resource when you create
          it. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of  which
          you  define. When you use tagging, you can also use tag-based access
          control in IAM policies to control access to this resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.
