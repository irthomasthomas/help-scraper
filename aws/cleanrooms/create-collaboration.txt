OPTIONS
       --members (list)
          A  list  of initial members, not including the creator. This list is
          immutable.

          (structure)
              Basic metadata used to construct a new member.

              accountId -> (string)
                 The identifier used to reference members  of  the  collabora-
                 tion. Currently only supports Amazon Web Services account ID.

              memberAbilities -> (list)
                 The abilities granted to the collaboration member.

                 (string)

              displayName -> (string)
                 The member's display name.

              paymentConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  collaboration  member's  payment responsibilities set by
                 the collaboration creator.

                 If the collaboration creator hasn't  specied  anyone  as  the
                 member  paying  for  query compute costs, then the member who
                 can query is the default payer.

                 queryCompute -> (structure)
                     The collaboration member's payment  responsibilities  set
                     by the collaboration creator for query compute costs.

                     isResponsible -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether  the collaboration creator has con-
                        figured the collaboration member to pay for query com-
                        pute  costs (TRUE ) or has not configured the collabo-
                        ration member to pay for query compute costs (FALSE ).

                        Exactly one member can be configured to pay for  query
                        compute  costs. An error is returned if the collabora-
                        tion creator sets a TRUE value for more than one  mem-
                        ber in the collaboration.

                        If  the  collaboration creator hasn't specified anyone
                        as the member paying for query compute costs, then the
                        member who can query is the default payer. An error is
                        returned if the collaboration  creator  sets  a  FALSE
                        value for the member who can query.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
