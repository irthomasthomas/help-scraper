                        privacy for two or more tables in a collaboration, you
                        must congure the same column as the user identier col-
                        umn in both analysis rules.

                               The name of the column, such as  user_id,  that
                               contains  the  unique identifier of your users,
                               whose privacy you want to protect. If you  want
                               to turn on differential privacy for two or more
                               tables in a collaboration, you  must  configure
                               the  same  column as the user identifier column
                               in both analysis rules.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                               threshold of distinct values  for  a  specified
                               column  that must exist in an output row for it
                               to be in the query output.

                 custom -> (structure)
                     A type of analysis rule that enables the table  owner  to
                     approve custom SQL queries on their configured tables. It
                     supports differential privacy.

                        The analysis templates that are allowed by the  custom
                        analysis rule.

                        (string)

                     allowedAnalysisProviders -> (list)

                        columns -> (list)
                            The name of the column (such as user_id) that con-
                            tains the unique identifier of  your  users  whose
                            privacy  you  want to protect. If you want to turn
                            on dierential privacy for two or more tables in  a
                            collaboration, you must congure the same column as
                            the user identier column in both analysis rules.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies the name of the column that  contains
                               the unique identifier of your users, whose pri-
                               vacy you want to protect.

                               name -> (string)
                                   The name of the column,  such  as  user_id,
                                   that contains the unique identifier of your
                                   users, whose privacy you want  to  protect.
                                   If you want to turn on differential privacy
                                   for two or more tables in a  collaboration,
                                   you  must  configure the same column as the
                                   user identifier  column  in  both  analysis
                                   rules.
