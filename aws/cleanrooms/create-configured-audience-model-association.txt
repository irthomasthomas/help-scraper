OPTIONS
       --membership-identifier (string)
          A unique identifier for one of your memberships for a collaboration.
          The  configured  audience  model  is associated to the collaboration
          that this membership belongs to. Accepts a membership ID.

       --configured-audience-model-arn (string)
          A unique identifier for the configured audience model that you  want
          to associate.

       --configured-audience-model-association-name (string)
          The name of the configured audience model association.

       --manage-resource-policies | --no-manage-resource-policies (boolean)
          When  TRUE  ,  indicates that the resource policy for the configured
          audience model resource being associated  is  configured  for  Clean
          Rooms to manage permissions related to the given collaboration. When
          FALSE , indicates that the configured audience model resource  owner
          will manage permissions related to the given collaboration.

          Setting this to TRUE requires you to have permissions to create, up-
          date, and delete the resource policy for the cleanrooms-ml  resource
          when  you  call  the   DeleteConfiguredAudienceModelAssociation  re-
          source. In addition, if you are the collaboration creator and  spec-
          ify  TRUE  ,  you  must  have the same permissions when you call the
          DeleteMember and  DeleteCollaboration APIs.

       --tags (map)
          An optional label that you can assign to a resource when you  create
          it.  Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which
          you define. When you use tagging, you can also use tag-based  access
          control in IAM policies to control access to this resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --description (string)
          A description of the configured audience model association.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.
