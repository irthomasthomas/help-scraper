OPTIONS
       --collaboration-identifier (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the collaboration that the analysis tem-
          plates belong to. Currently accepts collaboration ID.

       --analysis-template-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the analysis template
          within a collaboration.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

              NOTE:
                 This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following
                 top level keys can be set: text.

              The analysis parameters that have been specified in the analysis
              template.

              (structure)
                 Optional.  The  member  who can query can provide this place-
                 holder for a literal data value in an analysis template.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the parameter. The name  must  use  only  al-
                     phanumeric,  underscore (_), or hyphen (-) characters but

                     sis  template. The member who can query can override this
                     value in the query editor.

          validations -> (list)
              The validations that were performed.

              (structure)
                 The status details of the analysis template validation. Clean
                 Rooms  Differential  Privacy  uses  a  general-purpose  query
                 structure  to  support  complex  SQL  queries  and  validates
                 whether  an analysis template fits that general-purpose query
                 structure. Validation is performed  when  analysis  templates
                 are  created  and fetched. Because analysis templates are im-
                 mutable by design, we recommend that you create analysis tem-
                 plates  after  you associate the configured tables with their
                 analysis rule to your collaboration.
