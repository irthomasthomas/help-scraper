ASSOCIATE-NAT-GATEWAY-ADDRESS()                ASSOCIATE-NAT-GATEWAY-ADDRESS()



NAME
       associate-nat-gateway-address -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  Elastic IP addresses (EIPs) and private IPv4 addresses with
       a public NAT gateway. For more information, see Work with NAT  gateways
       in the Amazon VPC User Guide .

       By  default,  you can associate up to 2 Elastic IP addresses per public
       NAT gateway. You can increase the limit by requesting a  quota  adjust-
       ment. For more information, see Elastic IP address quotas in the Amazon
       VPC User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --nat-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the NAT gateway.

       --allocation-ids (list)
          The allocation IDs of EIPs that you want to associate with your  NAT
          gateway.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --private-ip-addresses (list)
          The  private IPv4 addresses that you want to assign to the NAT gate-
          way.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          (structure)
              Describes the IP addresses and network interface associated with
              a NAT gateway.

              AllocationId -> (string)
                 [Public NAT gateway only] The allocation ID of the Elastic IP
                 address that's associated with the NAT gateway.

              NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the network interface associated with the NAT gate-
                 way.

              PrivateIp -> (string)
                 The private IP address associated with the NAT gateway.

              PublicIp -> (string)
                 [Public  NAT  gateway only] The Elastic IP address associated
                 with the NAT gateway.

                 [Public NAT gateway only] The association ID of  the  Elastic
                 IP address that's associated with the NAT gateway.

              IsPrimary -> (boolean)
                 Defines if the IP address is the primary address.
