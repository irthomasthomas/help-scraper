DEPROVISION-BYOIP-CIDR()                              DEPROVISION-BYOIP-CIDR()



NAME
       deprovision-byoip-cidr -

DESCRIPTION
       Releases  the specified address range that you provisioned for use with
       your Amazon Web Services resources through bring your own IP  addresses
       (BYOIP) and deletes the corresponding address pool.

       Before  you  can release an address range, you must stop advertising it
       using  WithdrawByoipCidr and you must not have any IP  addresses  allo-
       cated from its address range.

OPTIONS
       --cidr (string)
          The  address  range,  in  CIDR notation. The prefix must be the same
          prefix that you specified when you provisioned the address range.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To remove an IP address range from use

       The following example removes the specified address range from use with
       AWS.

          aws ec2 deprovision-byoip-cidr \
              --cidr 203.0.113.25/24

       Output:

          {
              "ByoipCidr": {
                  "Cidr": "203.0.113.25/24",
                  "State": "pending-deprovision"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ByoipCidr -> (structure)
          Information about the address range.

          Cidr -> (string)
              The address range, in CIDR notation.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the address range.

          AsnAssociations -> (list)
              The BYOIP CIDR associations with ASNs.

              (structure)
                 An Autonomous System Number (ASN) and BYOIP CIDR association.

                 Asn -> (string)
                     The association's ASN.

                 Cidr -> (string)
                     The association's CIDR.

                 StatusMessage -> (string)
                     The association's status message.

                 State -> (string)
                     The association's state.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Upon success, contains the ID of the  address  pool.  Otherwise,
              contains an error message.

          State -> (string)
              The state of the address pool.

          NetworkBorderGroup -> (string)
              If you have Local Zones enabled, you can choose a network border
              group for Local Zones when you provision and advertise a BYOIPv4
              CIDR.  Choose  the network border group carefully as the EIP and
              the Amazon Web Services resource it is associated with must  re-
              side in the same network border group.

              You  can provision BYOIP address ranges to and advertise them in
              the following Local Zone network border groups:

              o us-east-1-dfw-2

              o us-west-2-lax-1

              o us-west-2-phx-2

              NOTE:
                 You cannot provision or advertise BYOIPv6 address  ranges  in
                 Local Zones at this time.
