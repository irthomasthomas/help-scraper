NAME
       modify-vpc-block-public-access-options -

DESCRIPTION
       Modify  VPC  Block Public Access (BPA) options. VPC Block Public Access
       (BPA) enables you to block resources in VPCs and subnets that  you  own
       in  a  Region  from reaching or being reached from the internet through
       internet gateways and egress-only  internet  gateways.  To  learn  more
       about  VPC BPA, see Block public access to VPCs and subnets in the Ama-
       zon VPC User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --internet-gateway-block-mode (string)
          The mode of VPC BPA.

          o off  :  VPC  BPA is not enabled and traffic is allowed to and from
            internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways  in  this  Re-
            gion.

          o block-bidirectional : Block all traffic to and from internet gate-
            ways and egress-only internet gateways in this Region (except  for
            excluded VPCs and subnets).

          o block-ingress : Block all internet traffic to the VPCs in this Re-
            gion (except for VPCs or subnets which are excluded). Only traffic
            to  and from NAT gateways and egress-only internet gateways is al-
            lowed because these gateways only allow outbound connections to be
            established.

          Possible values:

          o off

          o block-bidirectional

          o block-ingress

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       VpcBlockPublicAccessOptions -> (structure)
          Details related to the VPC Block Public Access (BPA) options.

          AwsAccountId -> (string)
              An Amazon Web Services account ID.

          State -> (string)
              The current state of VPC BPA.

              The current mode of VPC BPA.

              o off  :  VPC  BPA  is not enabled and traffic is allowed to and

                gateways and egress-only internet gateways in this Region (ex-
                cept for excluded VPCs and subnets).

              o block-ingress : Block all internet traffic to the VPCs in this
                Region (except for VPCs or subnets which are  excluded).  Only
                traffic  to  and  from  NAT  gateways and egress-only internet
                gateways is allowed because these gateways only allow outbound

          ExclusionsAllowed -> (string)
              Determines  if  exclusions  are allowed. If you have enabled VPC
              BPA at the Organization level , exclusions may be not-allowed  .
              Otherwise, they are allowed .
