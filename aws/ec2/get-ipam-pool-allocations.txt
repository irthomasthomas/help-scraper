GET-IPAM-POOL-ALLOCATIONS()                        GET-IPAM-POOL-ALLOCATIONS()



NAME
       get-ipam-pool-allocations -

DESCRIPTION
       Get a list of all the CIDR allocations in an IPAM pool.

       NOTE:
          If    you    use   this   action   after   AllocateIpamPoolCidr   or
          ReleaseIpamPoolAllocation , note that all EC2 API actions follow  an
          eventual consistency model.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-ipam-pool-allocations  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: IpamPoolAllocations

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM pool you want to see the allocations for.

       --ipam-pool-allocation-id (string)
          The ID of the allocation.

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters for the request. For more information about fil-
          tering, see Filtering CLI output .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the CIDRs allocated from an IPAM pool

       The  following  get-ipam-pool-allocations  example gets the CIDRs allo-
       cated from an IPAM pool.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 get-ipam-pool-allocations \
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0533048da7d823723 \
              --filters Name=ipam-pool-allocation-id,Values=ipam-pool-alloc-0e6186d73999e47389266a5d6991e6220

       (Windows):

          aws ec2 get-ipam-pool-allocations ^
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0533048da7d823723 ^
              --filters Name=ipam-pool-allocation-id,Values=ipam-pool-alloc-0e6186d73999e47389266a5d6991e6220

       Output:

          {
              "IpamPoolAllocations": [
                  {
                      "Cidr": "10.0.0.0/16",
                      "IpamPoolAllocationId": "ipam-pool-alloc-0e6186d73999e47389266a5d6991e6220",
                      "ResourceType": "custom",
                      "ResourceOwner": "123456789012"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       IpamPoolAllocations -> (list)
          The IPAM pool allocations you want information on.

          (structure)
              In IPAM, an allocation is a CIDR assignment from an IPAM pool to
              another IPAM pool or to a resource.

              Cidr -> (string)
                 The CIDR for the allocation. A CIDR is a representation of an
                 IP address and its associated network mask (or  netmask)  and
                 refers  to  a  range of IP addresses. An IPv4 CIDR example is
                 10.24.34.0/23 . An IPv6 CIDR example is 2001:DB8::/32 .

              IpamPoolAllocationId -> (string)
                 The ID of an allocation.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the pool allocation.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of the resource.

              ResourceRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region of the resource.

              ResourceOwner -> (string)
                 The owner of the resource.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
