ASSOCIATE-DHCP-OPTIONS()                              ASSOCIATE-DHCP-OPTIONS()



NAME
       associate-dhcp-options -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a set of DHCP options (that you've previously created) with
       the specified VPC, or associates no DHCP options with the VPC.

       After you associate the options with the VPC,  any  existing  instances
       and  all new instances that you launch in that VPC use the options. You
       don't need to restart or relaunch  the  instances.  They  automatically
       pick up the changes within a few hours, depending on how frequently the
       instance renews its DHCP lease. You can explicitly renew the lease  us-
       ing the operating system on the instance.

       For more information, see DHCP option sets in the Amazon VPC User Guide
       .

OPTIONS
       --dhcp-options-id (string)
          The ID of the DHCP options set, or default to associate no DHCP  op-
          tions with the VPC.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To associate a DHCP options set with your VPC

       This  example associates the specified DHCP options set with the speci-
       fied VPC. If the command succeeds, no output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 associate-dhcp-options --dhcp-options-id dopt-d9070ebb --vpc-id vpc-a01106c2

       To associate the default DHCP options set with your VPC

       This example associates the default DHCP options set with the specified
       VPC. If the command succeeds, no output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 associate-dhcp-options --dhcp-options-id default --vpc-id vpc-a01106c2

OUTPUT
       None
