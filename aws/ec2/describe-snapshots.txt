DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOTS()                                      DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOTS()



NAME
       describe-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  specified  EBS snapshots available to you or all of the
       EBS snapshots available to you.

       The snapshots available to you include public snapshots, private  snap-
       shots  that  you  own,  and private snapshots owned by other Amazon Web
       Services accounts for which you have  explicit  create  volume  permis-
       sions.

       The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:

       o public  : The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions
         for the snapshot to the all group. All Amazon Web  Services  accounts
         have create volume permissions for these snapshots.

       o explicit  :  The  owner of the snapshot granted create volume permis-
         sions to a specific Amazon Web Services account.

       o implicit : An Amazon Web Services account has implicit create  volume
         permissions for all snapshots it owns.

       The  list  of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot
       IDs, snapshot owners, or Amazon Web Services accounts with create  vol-
       ume  permissions.  If  no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all
       snapshots for which you have create volume permissions.

       If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that  have  the
       specified  IDs  are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an
       error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which  you  do  not
       have access, it is not included in the returned results.

       If  you  specify one or more snapshot owners using the OwnerIds option,
       only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have  access
       are  returned.  The results can include the Amazon Web Services account
       IDs of the specified owners, amazon for snapshots owned by  Amazon,  or
       self for snapshots that you own.

       If  you  specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create
       snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify Ama-
       zon Web Services account IDs (if you own the snapshots), self for snap-
       shots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or all for public
       snapshots.

       If  you  are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you
       paginate the output to make the list more manageable. For more informa-
       tion, see Pagination .

       scribeFastSnapshotRestores .

       describe-snapshots  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Snapshots

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o description - A description of the snapshot.

          o encrypted - Indicates whether the snapshot is  encrypted  (true  |
            false )

          o owner-alias  -  The  owner  alias,  from an Amazon-maintained list
            (amazon ). This is not the user-configured Amazon Web Services ac-
            count  alias  set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use
            the related parameter instead of this filter.

          o owner-id - The Amazon Web Services account ID  of  the  owner.  We
            recommend  that you use the related parameter instead of this fil-
            ter.

          o progress - The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for  ex-
            ample, 80%).

          o snapshot-id - The snapshot ID.

          o start-time - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

          o status  -  The status of the snapshot (pending | completed | error
            ).

          o storage-tier - The storage tier of the snapshot (archive  |  stan-
            dard ).

          o tag  :<key>  -  The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
            resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as
            the  filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,  re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o volume-id - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.

          o volume-size - The size of the volume, in GiB.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --owner-ids (list)
          Scopes  the  results to snapshots with the specified owners. You can
          specify a combination of Amazon Web Services account IDs, self , and
          amazon .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --restorable-by-user-ids (list)
          The  IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that can create volumes
          from the snapshot.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --snapshot-ids (list)
          The snapshot IDs.

          Default: Describes the snapshots for which you  have  create  volume
          permissions.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To describe a snapshot

       The  following describe-snapshots example describes the specified snap-
       shot.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --snapshot-ids snap-1234567890abcdef0

       Output:

          {
              "Snapshots": [
                  {
                      "Description": "This is my snapshot",
                      "Encrypted": false,
                      "VolumeId": "vol-049df61146c4d7901",
                      "State": "completed",
                      "VolumeSize": 8,
                      "StartTime": "2019-02-28T21:28:32.000Z",
                      "Progress": "100%",
                      "OwnerId": "012345678910",
                      "SnapshotId": "snap-01234567890abcdef",
                      "Tags": [
                          {
                              "Key": "Stack",
                              "Value": "test"
                          }
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Amazon EBS snapshots in the Amazon  EC2  User
       Guide.

       Example 2: To describe snapshots based on filters

       The  following describe-snapshots example uses filters to scope the re-
       sults to snapshots owned by your AWS account that are  in  the  pending
       state. The example uses the --query parameter to display only the snap-
       shot IDs and the time the snapshot was started.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --owner-ids self \
              --filters Name=status,Values=pending \
              --query "Snapshots[*].{ID:SnapshotId,Time:StartTime}"

       Output:

          [
              {
                  "ID": "snap-1234567890abcdef0",
                  "Time": "2019-08-04T12:48:18.000Z"
              },
              {
                  "ID": "snap-066877671789bd71b",
                  "Time": "2019-08-04T02:45:16.000Z
              },
              ...
          ]

       The following describe-snapshots example uses filters to scope the  re-
       sults  to snapshots created from the specified volume. The example uses
       the --query parameter to display only the snapshot IDs.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --filters Name=volume-id,Values=049df61146c4d7901 \
              --query "Snapshots[*].[SnapshotId]" \
              --output text

       Output:

          snap-1234567890abcdef0
          snap-08637175a712c3fb9
          ...

       For additional examples using filters, see Listing and  filtering  your
       resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 3: To describe snapshots based on tags

       The  following describe-snapshots example uses tag filters to scope the
       results to snapshots that have the tag Stack=Prod.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --filters Name=tag:Stack,Values=prod

       For an example of the output for describe-snapshots, see Example 1.

       For additional examples using tag filters, see Working with tags in the
       Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 4: To describe snapshots based on age

       The  following  describe-snapshots example uses JMESPath expressions to
       describe all snapshots created by your AWS account before the specified
       date. It displays only the snapshot IDs.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --owner-ids 012345678910 \
              --query "Snapshots[?(StartTime<='2020-03-31')].[SnapshotId]"

       For  additional  examples using filters, see Listing and filtering your
       resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 5: To view only archived snapshots

       The following describe-snapshots example lists only snapshots that  are
       stored in the archive tier.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --filters "Name=storage-tier,Values=archive"

       Output:

          {
              "Snapshots": [
                  {
                      "Description": "Snap A",
                      "Encrypted": false,
                      "VolumeId": "vol-01234567890aaaaaa",
                      "State": "completed",
                      "VolumeSize": 8,
                      "StartTime": "2021-09-07T21:00:00.000Z",
                      "Progress": "100%",
                      "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "SnapshotId": "snap-01234567890aaaaaa",
                      "StorageTier": "archive",
                      "Tags": []
                  },
              ]
          }

       Compute Cloud User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Snapshots -> (list)
          Information about the snapshots.

          (structure)
              Describes a snapshot.

              DataEncryptionKeyId -> (string)
                 The data encryption key identifier  for  the  snapshot.  This
                 value is a unique identifier that corresponds to the data en-
                 cryption key that was used to encrypt the original volume  or
                 snapshot  copy. Because data encryption keys are inherited by
                 volumes created from snapshots, and vice versa, if  snapshots
                 share  the same data encryption key identifier, then they be-
                 long to the same volume/snapshot lineage. This  parameter  is
                 only returned by  DescribeSnapshots .

              Description -> (string)
                 The description for the snapshot.

              Encrypted -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management Service
                 (KMS) KMS key that was used to protect the volume  encryption
                 key for the parent volume.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the EBS
                 snapshot.

              Progress -> (string)
                 The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage.

              SnapshotId -> (string)
                 The ID of the snapshot. Each snapshot receives a unique iden-
                 tifier when it is created.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

              State -> (string)
