REVOKE-SECURITY-GROUP-INGRESS()                REVOKE-SECURITY-GROUP-INGRESS()



NAME
       revoke-security-group-ingress -

       NOTE:
          To  specify  multiple rules in a single command use the --ip-permis-
          sions option

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the specified inbound (ingress) rules from a security group.

       You can specify rules using either rule  IDs  or  security  group  rule
       properties.  If  you  use  rule properties, the values that you specify
       (for example, ports) must match the  existing  rule's  values  exactly.
       Each  rule  has  a protocol, from and to ports, and source (CIDR range,
       security group, or prefix list). For the TCP  and  UDP  protocols,  you
       must  also specify the destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP
       protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. If the security
       group  rule  has a description, you do not need to specify the descrip-
       tion to revoke the rule.

       For a default VPC, if the values you specify do not match the  existing
       rule's values, no error is returned, and the output describes the secu-
       rity group rules that were not revoked.

       For a non-default VPC, if the values you specify do not match  the  ex-
       isting rule's values, an InvalidPermission.NotFound client error is re-
       turned, and no rules are revoked.

       Amazon Web Services recommends that you describe the security group  to
       verify that the rules were removed.

       Rule  changes  are propagated to instances within the security group as
       quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

OPTIONS
       --group-id (string)
          The ID of the security group.

       --group-name (string)
          [Default VPC] The name of the security group. You must  specify  ei-
          ther  the  security  group  ID or the security group name in the re-
          quest. For security groups in a nondefault VPC, you must specify the
          security group ID.

       --ip-permissions (list)
          The  sets  of  IP  permissions.  You can't specify a source security
          group and a CIDR IP address range in the same set of permissions.

          (structure)
              Describes the permissions for a security group rule.

              IpProtocol -> (string)
                 The IP protocol name (tcp , udp , icmp , icmpv6 )  or  number
                 (see Protocol Numbers ).

                 Use  -1  to  specify all protocols. When authorizing security
                 group rules, specifying -1 or a protocol  number  other  than
                 tcp , udp , icmp , or icmpv6 allows traffic on all ports, re-
                 gardless of any port range you specify. For tcp , udp  ,  and
                 icmp  ,  you must specify a port range. For icmpv6 , the port
                 range is optional; if you omit the port  range,  traffic  for
                 all types and codes is allowed.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 If  the protocol is TCP or UDP, this is the start of the port
                 range. If the protocol is ICMP or ICMPv6, this  is  the  ICMP
                 type or -1 (all ICMP types).

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 If  the  protocol  is TCP or UDP, this is the end of the port
                 range. If the protocol is ICMP or ICMPv6, this  is  the  ICMP
                 code  or  -1  (all  ICMP codes). If the start port is -1 (all
                 ICMP types), then the end port must be -1 (all ICMP codes).

              UserIdGroupPairs -> (list)
                 The security group and Amazon Web Services account ID pairs.

                 (structure)

                        For a referenced security group in  another  VPC,  the
                        account  ID  of  the  referenced security group is re-
                        turned in the response.  If  the  referenced  security

                        group ID.

                        For  a  referenced security group in another VPC, this
                        value is not returned if the referenced security group
                        is deleted.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --protocol (string)
          The IP protocol: tcp | udp | icmp

          (VPC only) Use all to specify all protocols.

          If this argument is provided without also providing the  port  argu-
          ment,  then it will be applied to all ports for the specified proto-
          col.

       --port (string)
          For TCP or UDP: The range of ports to allow. A single integer  or  a
          range (min-max ).

          For  ICMP: A single integer or a range (type-code ) representing the
          ICMP type number and the ICMP code number respectively. A  value  of
          -1  indicates  all ICMP codes for all ICMP types. A value of -1 just
          for type indicates all ICMP codes for the specified ICMP type.

       --cidr (string)
          The IPv4 address range, in CIDR format.

       --source-group (string)
          The name or ID of the source security group.

       --group-owner (string)
          The AWS account ID that owns the source security  group.  Cannot  be
          used when specifying a CIDR IP address.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To remove a rule from a security group

       The following revoke-security-group-ingress example removes TCP port 22
       access for the 203.0.113.0/24 address range from the specified security
       group for a default VPC.

          aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress \
              --group-name mySecurityGroup
              --protocol tcp \
              --port 22 \
              --cidr 203.0.113.0/24

       This command produces no output if it succeeds.

       For more information, see Security groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 2: To remove a rule using the IP permissions set

       The following revoke-security-group-ingress example uses the ip-permis-
       sions  parameter to remove an inbound rule that allows the ICMP message
       Destination Unreachable: Fragmentation Needed and  Don't  Fragment  was
       Set (Type 3, Code 4).

          aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress \
              --group-id sg-026c12253ce15eff7 \
              --ip-permissions IpProtocol=icmp,FromPort=3,ToPort=4,IpRanges=[{CidrIp=0.0.0.0/0}]

       This command produces no output if it succeeds.

       For more information, see Security groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns true if the request succeeds; otherwise, returns an error.

       UnknownIpPermissions -> (list)
          The  inbound  rules that were unknown to the service. In some cases,
          unknownIpPermissionSet might be in a different format from  the  re-
          quest parameter.

          (structure)
              Describes the permissions for a security group rule.

              IpProtocol -> (string)
                 The  IP  protocol name (tcp , udp , icmp , icmpv6 ) or number
                 (see Protocol Numbers ).

                 Use -1 to specify all protocols.  When  authorizing  security
                 group  rules,  specifying  -1 or a protocol number other than
                 tcp , udp , icmp , or icmpv6 allows traffic on all ports, re-
                 gardless  of  any port range you specify. For tcp , udp , and
                 icmp , you must specify a port range. For icmpv6 ,  the  port
                 range  is  optional;  if you omit the port range, traffic for
