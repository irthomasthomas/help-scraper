RUN-SCHEDULED-INSTANCES()                            RUN-SCHEDULED-INSTANCES()



NAME
       run-scheduled-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Launches the specified Scheduled Instances.

       Before  you  can  launch a Scheduled Instance, you must purchase it and
       obtain an identifier using  PurchaseScheduledInstances .

       You must launch a Scheduled Instance during its scheduled time  period.
       You can't stop or reboot a Scheduled Instance, but you can terminate it
       as needed. If you terminate a Scheduled  Instance  before  the  current
       scheduled  time  period  ends, you can launch it again after a few min-
       utes.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that ensures  the  idempotency  of
          the request. For more information, see Ensuring Idempotency .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

          ability  Zone,  network,  and platform of the schedule that you pur-
          chased.

              (structure)
                 Describes a block device mapping for a Scheduled Instance.

                 Ebs -> (structure)
                     Parameters used to set up EBS volumes automatically  when
                     the instance is launched.

                     DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether  the  volume is deleted on instance
                        termination.

                     Encrypted -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the volume is encrypted. You can at-
                        tached  encrypted  volumes only to instances that sup-
                        port them.

                     Iops -> (integer)
                        The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) to pro-
                        vision for a gp3 , io1 , or io2 volume.

                     SnapshotId -> (string)

                        The size of the volume, in GiB.

                        Default: If you're creating the volume from a snapshot
                        and don't specify a volume size, the  default  is  the
                        snapshot size.

                     VolumeType -> (string)
                        The volume type.

                        Default: gp2

                 NoDevice -> (string)
                     To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify
                     an empty string.

                 VirtualName -> (string)
                     The virtual device name  (ephemeral  N).  Instance  store
                     volumes  are  numbered  starting from 0. An instance type
                     with two available instance  store  volumes  can  specify
                     mappings  for  ephemeral0  and ephemeral1 . The number of
                     available instance store volumes depends on the  instance
                     type.  After  you connect to the instance, you must mount
                     the volume.

                     Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify  instance
                     store  volumes  in  the  block device mapping for the in-
                     stance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any in-
                     stance  store  volumes specified in the block device map-
                     ping for the AMI.

              Indicates whether the instances are optimized for EBS I/O.  This
              optimization  provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an
              optimized configuration stack to provide optimal EBS I/O perfor-
              mance.  This  optimization  isn't  available  with  all instance
              types. Additional usage charges apply when  using  an  EBS-opti-
              mized instance.

              Default: false

          IamInstanceProfile -> (structure)

                 AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether to assign a public IPv4 address to in-

                     only be assigned to a network interface for eth0, and can
                     only be assigned to a new network interface, not  an  ex-
                     isting  one. You cannot specify more than one network in-
                     terface in the request. If launching into a default  sub-
                     net, the default value is true .

                     Amazon  Web  Services  charges  for  all  public IPv4 ad-
                     dresses, including public IPv4 addresses associated  with
                     running  instances and Elastic IP addresses. For more in-
                     formation, see the Public IPv4 Address tab on the  Amazon
                     VPC pricing page .

       --scheduled-instance-id (string)
          The Scheduled Instance ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
