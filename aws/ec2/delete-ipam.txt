DELETE-IPAM()                                                    DELETE-IPAM()



NAME
       delete-ipam -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete  an IPAM. Deleting an IPAM removes all monitored data associated
       with the IPAM including the historical data for CIDRs.

       NOTE:
          You cannot delete an IPAM if there are CIDRs provisioned to pools or
          if  there  are allocations in the pools within the IPAM. To deprovi-
          sion pool CIDRs, see DeprovisionIpamPoolCidr .  To  release  alloca-
          tions, see ReleaseIpamPoolAllocation .

       For  more  information,  see Delete an IPAM in the Amazon VPC IPAM User
       Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-ipam
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --ipam-id <value>
          [--cascade | --no-cascade]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM to delete.

       --cascade | --no-cascade (boolean)
          Enables you to quickly delete an IPAM, private scopes, pools in pri-
          vate scopes, and any allocations in the pools in private scopes. You
          cannot  delete  the IPAM with this option if there is a pool in your
          public scope. If you use this option, IPAM does the following:

          o Deallocates any CIDRs allocated to VPC resources (such as VPCs) in
            pools in private scopes.

          NOTE:
              No  VPC  resources  are deleted as a result of enabling this op-
              tion. The CIDR associated with the resource will  no  longer  be
              allocated from an IPAM pool, but the CIDR itself will remain un-
              changed.

          o Deprovisions all IPv4 CIDRs provisioned to IPAM pools  in  private
            scopes.

          o Deletes all IPAM pools in private scopes.

          o Deletes all non-default private scopes in the IPAM.

          o Deletes the default public and private scopes and the IPAM.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an IPAM

       The following delete-ipam example deletes an IPAM.
