DESCRIPTION
       Delete  an IPAM. Deleting an IPAM removes all monitored data associated
       with the IPAM including the historical data for CIDRs.

       Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM to delete.

       --cascade | --no-cascade (boolean)
          Enables you to quickly delete an IPAM, private scopes, pools in pri-
          vate scopes, and any allocations in the pools in private scopes. You
          cannot delete the IPAM with this option if there is a pool  in  your
          public scope. If you use this option, IPAM does the following:

          o Deallocates any CIDRs allocated to VPC resources (such as VPCs) in
            pools in private scopes.

          NOTE:
              No VPC resources are deleted as a result of  enabling  this  op-
              tion.  The  CIDR  associated with the resource will no longer be
              allocated from an IPAM pool, but the CIDR itself will remain un-
              changed.

          o Deprovisions  all  IPv4 CIDRs provisioned to IPAM pools in private
            scopes.

          o Deletes all IPAM pools in private scopes.

          o Deletes all non-default private scopes in the IPAM.

          o Deletes the default public and private scopes and the IPAM.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following delete-ipam example deletes an IPAM.
