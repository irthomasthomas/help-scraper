BUNDLE-INSTANCE()                                            BUNDLE-INSTANCE()



NAME
       bundle-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Bundles an Amazon instance store-backed Windows instance.

       During  bundling,  only the root device volume (C:) is bundled. Data on
       other instance store volumes is not preserved.

       NOTE:
          This action is not applicable for Linux/Unix  instances  or  Windows
          instances that are backed by Amazon EBS.

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance to bundle.

          Default: None

       --storage (structure)
          The  bucket in which to store the AMI. You can specify a bucket that
          you already own or a new bucket that Amazon EC2 creates on your  be-
          half.  If  you specify a bucket that belongs to someone else, Amazon
          EC2 returns an error.

          S3 -> (structure)
              An Amazon S3 storage location.

              AWSAccessKeyId -> (string)
                 The access key ID of the owner  of  the  bucket.  Before  you
                 specify a value for your access key ID, review and follow the
                 guidance in Best Practices for Amazon Web  Services  accounts
                 in the Account ManagementReference Guide .

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The  bucket  in  which  to  store  the AMI. You can specify a
                 bucket that you already own or a new bucket that  Amazon  EC2
                 creates  on your behalf. If you specify a bucket that belongs
                 to someone else, Amazon EC2 returns an error.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The beginning of the file name of the AMI.

              UploadPolicy -> (blob)
                 An Amazon S3 upload policy that gives Amazon  EC2  permission
                 to upload items into Amazon S3 on your behalf.

              UploadPolicySignature -> (string)
                 The signature of the JSON document.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3={AWSAccessKeyId=string,Bucket=string,Prefix=string,UploadPolicy=blob,UploadPolicySignature=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3": {
              "AWSAccessKeyId": "string",
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Prefix": "string",
              "UploadPolicy": blob,
              "UploadPolicySignature": "string"
            }
          }

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --bucket (string) The bucket in which to store the AMI. You can specify
       a  bucket  that you already own or a new bucket that Amazon EC2 creates
       on your behalf. If you specify a bucket that belongs to  someone  else,
       Amazon EC2 returns an error.

       --prefix (string) The prefix for the image component names being stored
       in Amazon S3.

       --owner-akid (string) The access key ID of the owner of the  Amazon  S3
       bucket.

       --owner-sak  (string)  The  AWS  secret access key for the owner of the
       Amazon S3 bucket specified in the --bucket parameter. This parameter is
       required so that a signature can be computed for the policy.

       --policy (string) An Amazon S3 upload policy that gives Amazon EC2 per-
       mission to upload items into Amazon S3 on the  user's  behalf.  If  you
       provide  this  parameter, you must also provide your secret access key,
       so we can create a policy signature for you (the secret access  key  is
       not  passed  to  Amazon  EC2). If you do not provide this parameter, we
       generate an upload policy for you automatically. For  more  information
       about  upload  policies  see the sections about policy construction and
       signatures in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
