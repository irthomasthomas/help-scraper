GET-IPAM-RESOURCE-CIDRS()                            GET-IPAM-RESOURCE-CIDRS()



NAME
       get-ipam-resource-cidrs -

DESCRIPTION
       Get information about the resources in a scope.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-ipam-resource-cidrs  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: IpamResourceCidrs

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters for the request. For more information about fil-
          tering, see Filtering CLI output .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --ipam-scope-id (string)
          The ID of the scope that the resource is in.

       --ipam-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM pool that the resource is in.

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the resource.

       --resource-type (string)
          The resource type.

          Possible values:

          o vpc

          o subnet

          o eip

          o public-ipv4-pool

          o ipv6-pool

       --resource-tag (structure)
          The resource tag.

          Key -> (string)
              The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use  this  filter  to
              find  all  resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regard-
              less of the tag value.

          Value -> (string)
              The value for the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Key": "string",
            "Value": "string"
          }

       --resource-owner (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the CIDRs allocated to a resource

       The  following get-ipam-resource-cidrs example gets the CIDRs allocated
       to a resource.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 get-ipam-resource-cidrs \
              --ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-02fc38cd4c48e7d38 \
              --filters Name=management-state,Values=unmanaged

       (Windows):

          aws ec2 get-ipam-resource-cidrs ^
              --ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-02fc38cd4c48e7d38 ^
              --filters Name=management-state,Values=unmanaged

              IpUsage -> (double)
                 The percentage of IP address space in  use.  To  convert  the
                 decimal  to  a  percentage, multiply the decimal by 100. Note
                 the following:

                 o For a resources that are VPCs, this is the percentage of IP
                   address space in the VPC that's taken up by subnet CIDRs.

                 o For  resources  that are subnets, if the subnet has an IPv4
                   CIDR provisioned to it, this is the percentage of IPv4  ad-
                   dress  space in the subnet that's in use. If the subnet has
                   an IPv6 CIDR provisioned to it, the percentage of IPv6  ad-
                   dress  space  in  use is not represented. The percentage of
                   IPv6 address space in use cannot currently be calculated.

                 o For resources that are public IPv4 pools, this is the  per-
                   centage  of  IP address space in the pool that's been allo-
                   cated to Elastic IP addresses (EIPs).

              ComplianceStatus -> (string)
                 The compliance status of the IPAM resource. For more informa-
                 tion  on  compliance  statuses, see Monitor CIDR usage by re-
                 source in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

              ManagementState -> (string)
                 The management state of the resource.  For  more  information
                 about  management  states, see Monitor CIDR usage by resource
                 in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

              OverlapStatus -> (string)
                 The overlap status of an IPAM resource.  The  overlap  status
                 tells  you  if  the CIDR for a resource overlaps with another
                 CIDR in the scope. For more information on overlap  statuses,
                 see  Monitor  CIDR  usage  by resource in the Amazon VPC IPAM
                 User Guide .

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The ID of a VPC.
