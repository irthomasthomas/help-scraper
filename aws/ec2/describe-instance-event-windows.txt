NAME
       describe-instance-event-windows -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified event windows or all event windows.

       If  you  specify  event window IDs, the output includes information for
       only the specified event windows. If you specify  filters,  the  output
       includes  information for only those event windows that meet the filter
       criteria. If you do not specify event windows IDs or filters, the  out-
       put  includes  information for all event windows, which can affect per-
       formance. We recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the oper-
       ation returns quickly and successfully.

       For  more information, see Define event windows for scheduled events in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       describe-instance-event-windows is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: InstanceEventWindows

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-event-window-ids (list)
          The IDs of the event windows.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o dedicated-host-id - The event windows associated with  the  speci-
            fied Dedicated Host ID.

          o event-window-name  -  The event windows associated with the speci-
            fied names.

          o instance-id - The event windows associated with the specified  in-
            stance ID.

          o instance-tag - The event windows associated with the specified tag
            and value.

          o instance-tag-key - The event windows associated with the specified
            tag key, regardless of the value.

          o instance-tag-value  - The event windows associated with the speci-
            fied tag value, regardless of the key.

          o tag:<key> - The key/value combination of a  tag  assigned  to  the
            event window. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value
            as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have
            a tag with the key Owner and the value CMX , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and CMX for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the event window. Use  this
            filter  to  find all event windows that have a tag with a specific
            key, regardless of the tag value.

          o tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the event  window.  Use
            this  filter to find all event windows that have a tag with a spe-
            cific value, regardless of the tag key.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To describe all event windows

       The  following  describe-instance-event-windows  example  describes all
       event windows in the specified Region.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-event-windows \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceEventWindows": [
                  {
                      "InstanceEventWindowId": "iew-0abcdef1234567890",
                      "Name": "myEventWindowName",
                      "CronExpression": "* 21-23 * * 2,3",
                      "AssociationTarget": {
                          "InstanceIds": [
                              "i-1234567890abcdef0",
                              "i-0598c7d356eba48d7"
                          ],
                          "Tags": [],
                          "DedicatedHostIds": []
                      },
                      "State": "active",
                      "Tags": []
                  }

                  ...

              ],
              "NextToken": "9d624e0c-388b-4862-a31e-a85c64fc1d4a"
          }

       Example 2: To describe a specific event window

       The following describe-instance-event-windows example describes a  spe-
       cific  event by using the instance-event-window parameter to describe a
       specific event window.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-event-windows \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --instance-event-window-ids iew-0abcdef1234567890

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceEventWindows": [
                  {
                      "InstanceEventWindowId": "iew-0abcdef1234567890",
                      "Name": "myEventWindowName",
                      "CronExpression": "* 21-23 * * 2,3",
                      "AssociationTarget": {
                          "InstanceIds": [
                              "i-1234567890abcdef0",
                              "i-0598c7d356eba48d7"
                          ],
                          "Tags": [],
                          "DedicatedHostIds": []
                      },
                      "State": "active",
                      "Tags": []
                  }
          }

       Example 3: To describe event windows that match one or more filters

       The following describe-instance-event-windows example  describes  event
       windows  that match one or more filters using the filter parameter. The
       instance-id filter is used to describe all of the  event  windows  that
       are  associated  with the specified instance. When a filter is used, it
       performs a direct match. However, the instance-id filter is  different.
       If  there  is no direct match to the instance ID, then it falls back to
       indirect associations with the event window, such as the  tags  of  the
       instance or Dedicated Host ID (if the instance is a Dedicated Host).

          aws ec2 describe-instance-event-windows \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --filters Name=instance-id,Values=i-1234567890abcdef0 \
              --max-results 100 \
              --next-token <next-token-value>

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceEventWindows": [
                  {
                      "InstanceEventWindowId": "iew-0dbc0adb66f235982",
                      "TimeRanges": [
                          {
                              "StartWeekDay": "sunday",
                              "StartHour": 2,
                              "EndWeekDay": "sunday",
                              "EndHour": 8
                          }
                      ],
                      "Name": "myEventWindowName",
                      "AssociationTarget": {
                          "InstanceIds": [],
                          "Tags": [],
                          "DedicatedHostIds": [
                              "h-0140d9a7ecbd102dd"
                          ]
                      },
                      "State": "active",
                      "Tags": []
                  }
              ]
          }

       In  the  example  output, the instance is on a Dedicated Host, which is
       associated with the event window.

       For event window constraints, see Considerations in the Amazon EC2 User
       Guide.
