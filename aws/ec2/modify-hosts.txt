MODIFY-HOSTS()                                                  MODIFY-HOSTS()



NAME
       modify-hosts -

DESCRIPTION
       Modify the auto-placement setting of a Dedicated Host. When auto-place-
       ment is enabled, any instances that you launch with a tenancy  of  host
       but  without a specific host ID are placed onto any available Dedicated
       Host in your account that has auto-placement enabled. When  auto-place-
       ment  is  disabled,  you need to provide a host ID to have the instance
       launch onto a specific host. If no host ID is provided, the instance is
       launched onto a suitable host with auto-placement enabled.

       You  can also use this API action to modify a Dedicated Host to support
       either multiple instance types in an instance family, or to  support  a
       specific instance type only.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-hosts
          [--auto-placement <value>]
          --host-ids <value>
          [--host-recovery <value>]
          [--instance-type <value>]
          [--instance-family <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-placement (string)
          Specify whether to enable or disable auto-placement.

          Possible values:

          o on

          o off

       --host-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts to modify.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --host-recovery (string)
          Indicates  whether  to enable or disable host recovery for the Dedi-
          cated Host. For more information, see Host recovery  in  the  Amazon
          EC2 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o on

          o off

       --instance-type (string)
          Specifies  the  instance type to be supported by the Dedicated Host.
          Specify this parameter to modify a Dedicated Host to support only  a
          specific instance type.

          If  you want to modify a Dedicated Host to support multiple instance
          types in its current instance family, omit this parameter and  spec-
          ify  InstanceFamily instead. You cannot specify InstanceType and In-
          stanceFamily in the same request.

       --instance-family (string)
          Specifies the instance family to be supported by the Dedicated Host.
          Specify  this parameter to modify a Dedicated Host to support multi-
          ple instance types within its current instance family.

          If you want to modify a Dedicated Host to  support  a  specific  in-
          stance  type  only, omit this parameter and specify InstanceType in-
          stead. You cannot specify InstanceFamily  and  InstanceType  in  the
          same request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To enable auto-placement for a Dedicated Host

       The  following  modify-hosts example enables auto-placement for a Dedi-
       cated Host so that it accepts any  untargeted  instance  launches  that
       match its instance type configuration.

          aws ec2 modify-hosts \
              --host-id h-06c2f189b4EXAMPLE \
              --auto-placement on

       Output:

          {
              "Successful": [
                  "h-06c2f189b4EXAMPLE"
              ],
              "Unsuccessful": []
          }

       Example 2: To enable host recovery for a Dedicated Host

       The following modify-hosts example enables host recovery for the speci-
       fied Dedicated Host.

          aws ec2 modify-hosts \
              --host-id h-06c2f189b4EXAMPLE \
              --host-recovery on

       Output:

          {
              "Successful": [
                  "h-06c2f189b4EXAMPLE"
              ],
              "Unsuccessful": []
          }
