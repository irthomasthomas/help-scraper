NAME
       get-ipam-discovered-resource-cidrs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  resource  CIDRs  that are monitored as part of a resource
       discovery. A discovered resource is a resource CIDR monitored  under  a
       resource  discovery.  The  following resources can be discovered: VPCs,
       Public IPv4 pools, VPC subnets, and Elastic IP addresses.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-ipam-discovered-resource-cidrs is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: IpamDiscoveredResourceCidrs

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-resource-discovery-id (string)
          A resource discovery ID.

       --resource-region (string)
          A resource Region.

       --filters (list)
          Filters.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view the IP address CIDRs discovered by an IPAM

       In  this  example,  you're a IPAM delegated admin who wants to view de-
       tails related to the IP address CIDRs for resources that  the  IPAM  is
       discovering.

       To complete this request:

       o The resource discovery you choose must be associated with the IPAM.

       o The --resource-region is the AWS Region where resource was created.

       The  following  get-ipam-discovered-resource-cidrs example lists the IP
       addresses for resources that the IPAM is discovering.

          aws ec2 get-ipam-discovered-resource-cidrs \
             --ipam-resource-discovery-id ipam-res-disco-0365d2977fc1672fe \
             --resource-region us-east-1

       Output:

OUTPUT
       IpamDiscoveredResourceCidrs -> (list)
          Discovered resource CIDRs.

          (structure)
              An IPAM discovered resource CIDR. A discovered resource is a re-
              source CIDR monitored under a resource discovery. The  following
              resources  can  be discovered: VPCs, Public IPv4 pools, VPC sub-
              nets, and Elastic IP addresses. The discovered resource CIDR  is
              the  IP  address  range in CIDR notation that is associated with
              the resource.

              IpamResourceDiscoveryId -> (string)
                 The resource discovery ID.

              ResourceRegion -> (string)
                 The resource Region.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The resource ID.

              ResourceOwnerId -> (string)
                 The resource owner ID.

              ResourceCidr -> (string)
                 The resource CIDR.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type.

              ResourceTags -> (list)
                 The resource tags.

                 (structure)
                     The key/value combination of a tag assigned  to  the  re-
                     source.  Use  the  tag key in the filter name and the tag
                     value as the filter value. For example, to find  all  re-
                     sources  that have a tag with the key Owner and the value
                     TeamA , specify tag:Owner for the filter name  and  TeamA
                     for the filter value.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  key  of  a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
                        filter to find all resources assigned  a  tag  with  a
                        specific key, regardless of the tag value.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

              IpUsage -> (double)
                 The  percentage  of  IP  address space in use. To convert the
                 decimal to a percentage, multiply the decimal  by  100.  Note
                 the following:

                 o For  resources  that are VPCs, this is the percentage of IP
                   address space in the VPC that's taken up by subnet CIDRs.

                 o For resources that are subnets, if the subnet has  an  IPv4
                   CIDR  provisioned to it, this is the percentage of IPv4 ad-
                   dress space in the subnet that's in use. If the subnet  has
                   an  IPv6 CIDR provisioned to it, the percentage of IPv6 ad-
                   dress space in use is not represented.  The  percentage  of
                   IPv6 address space in use cannot currently be calculated.

                 o For  resources that are public IPv4 pools, this is the per-
                   centage of IP address space in the pool that's  been  allo-
                   cated to Elastic IP addresses (EIPs).

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The VPC ID.

              SampleTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last successful resource discovery time.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Specify the pagination token from a previous request to retrieve the
          next page of results.
