OPTIONS
       --allocation-id (string)
          The allocation ID of an Elastic IP address.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disable an Elastic IP address transfer

       The following disable-address-transfer example disables Elastic IP  ad-
       dress transfer for the specified Elastic IP address.

          aws ec2 disable-address-transfer \
              --allocation-id eipalloc-09ad461b0d03f6aaf

       Output:

          {
              "AddressTransfer": {
                  "PublicIp": "100.21.184.216",
                  "AllocationId": "eipalloc-09ad461b0d03f6aaf",
                  "AddressTransferStatus": "disabled"
              }
          }

       VPC User Guide.

OUTPUT
       AddressTransfer -> (structure)
          An Elastic IP address transfer.

          PublicIp -> (string)
              The Elastic IP address being transferred.

          AllocationId -> (string)
              The allocation ID of an Elastic IP address.

          TransferAccountId -> (string)
              The ID of the account that you want to transfer the  Elastic  IP
              address to.

          TransferOfferExpirationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp when the Elastic IP address transfer expired. When
              the source account starts the transfer, the transfer account has
              seven  hours  to allocate the Elastic IP address to complete the
              transfer, or the Elastic IP address will return to its  original
              owner.

          TransferOfferAcceptedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp when the Elastic IP address transfer was accepted.

          AddressTransferStatus -> (string)
              The Elastic IP address transfer status.
