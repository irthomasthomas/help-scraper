OPTIONS
       --traffic-mirror-filter-rule-ids (list)
          Traffic filter rule IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --traffic-mirror-filter-id (string)
          Traffic filter ID.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          Traffic mirror filters.

          o traffic-mirror-filter-rule-id : The ID of the Traffic Mirror rule.

          o traffic-mirror-filter-id  : The ID of the filter that this rule is
            associated with.

          o rule-number : The number of the Traffic Mirror rule.

          o rule-action : The action taken on the filtered  traffic.  Possible
            actions are accept and reject .

          o traffic-direction : The traffic direction. Possible directions are
            ingress and egress .

          o protocol : The protocol, for example UDP, assigned to the  Traffic
            Mirror rule.

          o source-cidr-block  : The source CIDR block assigned to the Traffic
            Mirror rule.

          o destination-cidr-block : The destination CIDR  block  assigned  to
            the Traffic Mirror rule.

          o description : The description of the Traffic Mirror rule.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of results to return with a single call. To re-
          trieve the remaining results, make another call  with  the  returned
          nextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
