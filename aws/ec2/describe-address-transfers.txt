NAME
       describe-address-transfers -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  an  Elastic  IP  address transfer. For more information, see
       Transfer Elastic IP addresses in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud  User
       Guide .

       When  you transfer an Elastic IP address, there is a two-step handshake
       between the source and transfer Amazon Web Services accounts. When  the
       source account starts the transfer, the transfer account has seven days
       to accept the Elastic IP address transfer. During those seven days, the
       source  account can view the pending transfer by using this action. Af-
       ter seven days, the transfer expires and ownership of  the  Elastic  IP
       address  returns  to the source account. Accepted transfers are visible
       to the source account for three days after the transfers have been  ac-
       cepted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-address-transfers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: AddressTransfers

OPTIONS
       --allocation-ids (list)
          The allocation IDs of Elastic IP addresses.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe an Elastic IP address transfer

       The following describe-address-transfers example describes the  Elastic
       IP address transfer for the specified Elastic IP address.

          aws ec2 describe-address-transfers \
              --allocation-ids eipalloc-09ad461b0d03f6aaf

       Output:

          {
              "AddressTransfers": [
                  {
                      "PublicIp": "100.21.184.216",
                      "AllocationId": "eipalloc-09ad461b0d03f6aaf",
                      "TransferAccountId": "123456789012",
                      "TransferOfferExpirationTimestamp": "2023-02-22T22:51:01.000Z",
                      "AddressTransferStatus": "pending"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       AddressTransfers -> (list)
          The Elastic IP address transfer.

          (structure)
              Details on the Elastic IP address transfer.  For  more  informa-
              tion,  see  Transfer  Elastic IP addresses in the Amazon Virtual
              Private Cloud User Guide .

              PublicIp -> (string)
                 The Elastic IP address being transferred.

              AllocationId -> (string)
                 The allocation ID of an Elastic IP address.

              TransferAccountId -> (string)
                 The ID of the account that you want to transfer  the  Elastic
                 IP address to.

              TransferOfferExpirationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  when the Elastic IP address transfer expired.
                 When the source account starts the transfer, the transfer ac-
                 count  has  seven hours to allocate the Elastic IP address to
                 complete the transfer, or the Elastic IP address will  return
                 to its original owner.

              TransferOfferAcceptedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  when  the Elastic IP address transfer was ac-
                 cepted.

              AddressTransferStatus -> (string)
                 The Elastic IP address transfer status.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Specify the pagination token from a previous request to retrieve the
          next page of results.
