NAME
       describe-spot-fleet-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes your Spot Fleet requests.

       Spot  Fleet  requests  are deleted 48 hours after they are canceled and
       their instances are terminated.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-spot-fleet-requests is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: SpotFleetRequestConfigs

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --spot-fleet-request-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Spot Fleet requests.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to  include  in  another request to get the next page of
          items. This value is null when there are no more items to return.

       SpotFleetRequestConfigs -> (list)
          Information about the configuration of your Spot Fleet.

          (structure)
              Describes a Spot Fleet request.

              ActivityStatus -> (string)
                 The progress of the Spot Fleet request. If there is an error,
                 the status is error . After all requests are placed, the sta-
                 tus is pending_fulfillment . If the  size  of  the  fleet  is
                 equal  to  or greater than its target capacity, the status is
                 fulfilled . If the size of the fleet is decreased, the status
                 is pending_termination while Spot Instances are terminating.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date and time of the request.

              SpotFleetRequestConfig -> (structure)
                 The configuration of the Spot Fleet request.

                 AllocationStrategy -> (string)
                     The  strategy  that determines how to allocate the target
                     Spot Instance capacity across  the  Spot  Instance  pools
                     specified  by  the  Spot  Fleet launch configuration. For
                     more information, see Allocation strategies for Spot  In-
                     stances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .
                        priceCapacityOptimized (recommended)

                     Spot Fleet identifies the pools with the highest capacity
                     availability for the number of instances that are launch-
                     ing.  This means that we will request Spot Instances from
                     the pools that we believe have the lowest chance  of  in-
                     terruption  in  the  near  term. Spot Fleet then requests
                     Spot Instances from the lowest priced of these pools.
                        capacityOptimized

                     Spot Fleet identifies the pools with the highest capacity
                     availability for the number of instances that are launch-
                     ing. This means that we will request Spot Instances  from
                     the  pools  that we believe have the lowest chance of in-
                     terruption in the near term.  To  give  certain  instance
                     types a higher chance of launching first, use capacityOp-
                     timizedPrioritized . Set a  priority  for  each  instance
                     type  by  using  the Priority parameter for LaunchTempla-
                     teOverrides . You can assign the same priority to differ-
                     ent  LaunchTemplateOverrides . EC2 implements the priori-
                     ties on a best-effort basis, but optimizes  for  capacity
                     first.  capacityOptimizedPrioritized is supported only if
                     your Spot Fleet uses a launch template. Note that if  the
                     OnDemandAllocationStrategy  is  set  to prioritized , the
                     same priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand capac-
                     ity.
                        diversified

                     Spot  Fleet  requests  instances from all of the Spot In-
                     stance pools that you specify.
                        lowestPrice (not recommended)

                     WARNING:
                        We don't recommend the lowestPrice allocation strategy
                        because  it  has  the highest risk of interruption for
                        your Spot Instances.

                     Spot Fleet requests instances from the lowest priced Spot
                     Instance  pool that has available capacity. If the lowest
                     priced pool doesn't have available capacity, the Spot In-
                     stances  come  from  the next lowest priced pool that has
                     available capacity. If a pool runs out of capacity before
                     fulfilling  your  desired  capacity, Spot Fleet will con-
                     tinue to fulfill your request by drawing  from  the  next
                     lowest  priced pool. To ensure that your desired capacity
                     is met, you might receive  Spot  Instances  from  several
                     pools.  Because  this  strategy  only  considers instance
                     price and not capacity availability,  it  might  lead  to
                     high interruption rates.

                     Default: lowestPrice

                 OnDemandAllocationStrategy -> (string)
                     The order of the launch template overrides to use in ful-
                     filling On-Demand capacity. If you specify lowestPrice  ,
                     Spot  Fleet  uses price to determine the order, launching
                     the lowest price first. If you specify prioritized , Spot
                     Fleet  uses  the  priority  that  you assign to each Spot
                     Fleet launch template  override,  launching  the  highest
                     priority first. If you do not specify a value, Spot Fleet
                     defaults to lowestPrice .

                 SpotMaintenanceStrategies -> (structure)
                     The strategies for managing your Spot Instances that  are

                               launch - Spot Fleet launches a new  replacement
                               Spot  Instance when a rebalance notification is
                               emitted for an existing Spot  Instance  in  the
                               fleet.  Spot  Fleet  does not terminate the in-
                               stances that receive a rebalance  notification.
                               You can terminate the old instances, or you can
                               leave them running. You are charged for all in-
                               stances while they are running.

                               notification.

                        TerminationDelay -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of  time (in seconds) that Amazon EC2
                            waits before terminating the old Spot Instance af-
                            ter launching a new replacement Spot Instance.

                 ClientToken -> (string)
                     A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to
                     ensure  the  idempotency  of your listings. This helps to
                     avoid  duplicate  listings.  For  more  information,  see
                     Ensuring Idempotency .

                 ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy -> (string)
                     Indicates  whether running instances should be terminated
                     if you decrease the target capacity of the Spot Fleet re-

                     The number of On-Demand units fulfilled by  this  request
                     compared to the set target On-Demand capacity.

                 IamFleetRole -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access
                     Management (IAM) role that grants the Spot Fleet the per-
                     mission  to request, launch, terminate, and tag instances
                     on your behalf. For more information, see Spot Fleet pre-
                     requisites  in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . Spot Fleet can
                     terminate Spot Instances on your behalf when  you  cancel
                     its  Spot  Fleet request using CancelSpotFleetRequests or
                     when the Spot Fleet request expires, if  you  set  Termi-
                     nateInstancesWithExpiration .

                 LaunchSpecifications -> (list)
                     The  launch specifications for the Spot Fleet request. If
                     you specify  LaunchSpecifications  ,  you  can't  specify
                     LaunchTemplateConfigs . If you include On-Demand capacity
                     in your request, you must use LaunchTemplateConfigs .

                     NOTE:
                        If an AMI  specified  in  a  launch  specification  is
                        deregistered  or  disabled,  no  new  instances can be
                        launched from the AMI. For fleets of type  maintain  ,
                        the target capacity will not be maintained.

                     (structure)
                        Describes  the  launch  specification  for one or more
                        Spot Instances. If you include On-Demand  capacity  in
                        your  fleet  request or want to specify an EFA network
                        device, you can't use  SpotFleetLaunchSpecification  ;
                        you must use LaunchTemplateConfig .

                        SecurityGroups -> (list)
                            The security groups.

                            If you specify a network interface, you must spec-
                            ify any security groups as part of the network in-
                            terface instead of using this parameter.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a security group.

                               GroupName -> (string)
                                   The name of the security group.

                               GroupId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the security group.

                        AddressingType -> (string)
                            Deprecated.

                        BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)
                            One  or  more block devices that are mapped to the
                            Spot Instances. You can't specify both a  snapshot
                            ID  and  an encryption value. This is because only
                            blank volumes can be encrypted on creation.  If  a
                            snapshot  is  the  basis  for  a volume, it is not
                            blank and its encryption status is  used  for  the
                            volume encryption status.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a block device mapping, which defines
                               the EBS volumes and instance store  volumes  to
                               attach to an instance at launch.

                               DeviceName -> (string)
                                   The  device  name (for example, /dev/sdh or
                                   xvdh ).

                               VirtualName -> (string)
                                   The virtual device name (ephemeral N).  In-
                                   stance  store volumes are numbered starting
                                   from 0. An instance type with  2  available
                                   instance store volumes can specify mappings
                                   for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The  number
                                   of available instance store volumes depends
                                   on the instance type. After you connect  to
                                   the instance, you must mount the volume.

                                   NVMe  instance  store volumes are automati-
                                   cally  enumerated  and  assigned  a  device
                                   name.  Including  them in your block device
                                   mapping has no effect.

                                   Constraints: For  M3  instances,  you  must
                                   specify instance store volumes in the block
                                   device mapping for the instance.  When  you
                                   launch  an  M3  instance, we ignore any in-
                                   stance store volumes specified in the block
                                   device mapping for the AMI.

                               Ebs -> (structure)
                                   Parameters used to automatically set up EBS
                                   volumes when the instance is launched.

                                   DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates  whether  the  EBS  volume  is
                                      deleted  on  instance  termination.  For
                                      more information, see Preserving  Amazon
                                      EBS  volumes  on instance termination in

                                   Iops -> (integer)
                                      The number of I/O operations per  second
                                      (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes,
                                      this represents the number of IOPS  that
                                      are  provisioned for the volume. For gp2
                                      volumes, this  represents  the  baseline
                                      performance  of  the volume and the rate
                                      at  which  the  volume  accumulates  I/O
                                      credits for bursting.

                                      The  following  are the supported values
                                      for each volume type:

                                      o gp3 : 3,000 - 16,000 IOPS

                                      o io1 : 100 - 64,000 IOPS

                                      o io2 : 100 - 256,000 IOPS

                                      For io2 volumes, you can achieve  up  to
                                      256,000  IOPS  on instances built on the
                                      Nitro System . On other  instances,  you
                                      can  achieve  performance  up  to 32,000
                                      IOPS.

                                      This parameter is required for  io1  and
                                      io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes
                                      is 3,000 IOPS.

                                   SnapshotId -> (string)
                                      The ID of the snapshot.

                                   VolumeSize -> (integer)
                                      The size of the  volume,  in  GiBs.  You
                                      must  specify  either a snapshot ID or a
                                      volume size. If you specify a  snapshot,
                                      the  default  is  the snapshot size. You
                                      can specify a volume size that is  equal
                                      to or larger than the snapshot size.

                                      The  following  are  the supported sizes
                                      for each volume type:

                                      o gp2 and gp3 : 1 - 16,384 GiB

                                      o io1 : 4 - 16,384 GiB

                                      o io2 : 4 - 65,536 GiB

                                      o st1 and sc1 : 125 - 16,384 GiB

                                   KmsKeyId -> (string)
                                      Identifier (key ID, key alias,  ID  ARN,
                                      or alias ARN) for a customer managed CMK
                                      under which the EBS volume is encrypted.

                                      This  parameter  is  only  supported  on
                                      BlockDeviceMapping   objects  called  by
                                      RunInstances ,  RequestSpotFleet  ,  and
                                      RequestSpotInstances .

                                   Throughput -> (integer)
                                      The throughput that the volume supports,
                                      in MiB/s.

                                      This parameter is  valid  only  for  gp3
                                      volumes.

                                      Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maxi-
                                      mum value of 1000.

                                   OutpostArn -> (string)
                                      The ARN of  the  Outpost  on  which  the
                                      snapshot is stored.

                                      This parameter is not supported when us-
                                      ing CreateImage .

                                   Encrypted -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates whether the  encryption  state
                                      of  an EBS volume is changed while being
                                      restored from a  backing  snapshot.  The
                                      effect  of  setting the encryption state
                                      to true depends  on  the  volume  origin
                                      (new  or  from a snapshot), starting en-
                                      cryption state, ownership,  and  whether
                                      encryption  by  default  is enabled. For
                                      more information, see Amazon EBS encryp-
                                      tion in the Amazon EBS User Guide .

                                      In  no  case  can  you remove encryption
                                      from an encrypted volume.

                                      Encrypted volumes can only  be  attached
                                      to instances that support Amazon EBS en-
                                      cryption.  For  more  information,   see

                                      For  CreateImage  and   RegisterImage  ,
                                      whether  you can include this parameter,
                                      and the allowed values differ  depending
                                      on  the type of block device mapping you
                                      are creating.

                                      o If you are  creating  a  block  device
                                        mapping for a new (empty) volume , you
                                        can include this parameter, and  spec-
                                        ify  either true for an encrypted vol-
                                        ume, or false for an unencrypted  vol-
                                        ume.  If  you  omit this parameter, it
                                        defaults to false (unencrypted).

                                      o If you are  creating  a  block  device
                                        mapping  from an existing encrypted or
                                        unencrypted snapshot , you  must  omit
                                        this  parameter.  If  you include this
                                        parameter, the request will fail,  re-
                                        gardless  of  the value that you spec-
                                        ify.

                                      o If you are  creating  a  block  device
                                        mapping  from  an existing unencrypted
                                        volume , you can include this  parame-
                                        ter,  but  you must specify false . If
                                        you specify true ,  the  request  will
                                        fail.  In this case, we recommend that
                                        you omit the parameter.

                                      o If you are  creating  a  block  device
                                        mapping  from  an  existing  encrypted
                                        volume , you can include this  parame-
                                        ter,  and specify either true or false
                                        . However, if you specify false ,  the
                                        parameter is ignored and the block de-
                                        vice mapping is always  encrypted.  In
                                        this  case, we recommend that you omit
                                        the parameter.

                               NoDevice -> (string)
                                   To omit the device from  the  block  device
                                   mapping, specify an empty string. When this
                                   property is specified, the  device  is  re-
                                   moved from the block device mapping regard-
                                   less of the assigned value.

                        EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether the instances are optimized  for
                            EBS  I/O.  This  optimization  provides  dedicated
                            throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configu-
                            ration  stack  to  provide optimal EBS I/O perfor-
                            mance. This optimization isn't available with  all
                            instance  types.  Additional  usage  charges apply
                            when using an EBS Optimized instance.

                                   to a network interface for  eth0,  and  can
                                   only  be  assigned  to a new network inter-
                                   face, not an existing one. You cannot spec-
                                   ify  more than one network interface in the
                                   request. If launching into a  default  sub-

                               DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                                   If set to true , the interface  is  deleted
                                   when  the  instance  is terminated. You can
                                   specify true only if creating a new network
                                   interface when launching an instance.

                               Description -> (string)

                                   terface has a device index of 0.

                                   If  you  specify  a  network interface when
                                   launching an instance, you must specify the
                                   device index.

                               Groups -> (list)

                                   network  interface.  Amazon EC2 chooses the
                                   IPv6 addresses from the range of  the  sub-
                                   net. You cannot specify this option and the
                                   option to assign specific IPv6 addresses in
                                   the  same request. You can specify this op-
                                   tion if you've specified a  minimum  number
                                   of instances to launch.

                               Ipv6Addresses -> (list)

                                   interface. You cannot specify  this  option
                                   and  the  option to assign a number of IPv6
                                   addresses in the same request.  You  cannot
                                   specify  this  option if you've specified a
                                   minimum number of instances to launch.

                                   (structure)
                                      Describes an IPv6 address.

                                      Ipv6Address -> (string)
                                          The IPv6 address.

                                      IsPrimaryIpv6 -> (boolean)
                                          Determines if an IPv6 address  asso-

                            tional  drivers  at  launch.  Check the kernel re-
                            quirements for information about whether you  need
                            to  specify  a  RAM  disk. To find kernel require-
                            ments, refer to the Amazon Web  Services  Resource
                            Center and search for the kernel ID.

                        SpotPrice -> (string)

                            ing to pay for a Spot Instance. We do  not  recom-
                            mend  using  this parameter because it can lead to
                            increased interruptions. If  you  do  not  specify
                            this  parameter,  you  will  pay  the current Spot
                            price.

                            WARNING:
                               If you specify a maximum price, your  instances
                               will be interrupted more frequently than if you
                               do not specify this parameter.

                        SubnetId -> (string)
                            The IDs of the subnets in which to launch the  in-
                            stances.  To  specify  multiple  subnets, separate
                            them using commas; for example, "subnet-1234abcde-
                            example1, subnet-0987cdef6example2".

                            If you specify a network interface, you must spec-
                            ify any subnets as part of the  network  interface
                            instead of using this parameter.

                        UserData -> (string)
                            The  base64-encoded  user  data that instances use
                            when starting up. User data is limited to 16 KB.

                        WeightedCapacity -> (double)
                            The number of units provided by the specified  in-
                            stance  type.  These  are  the same units that you
                            chose to set the target capacity in terms  of  in-
                            stances,  or  a performance characteristic such as
                            vCPUs, memory, or I/O.

                            If the target capacity divided by  this  value  is
                            not  a  whole number, Amazon EC2 rounds the number
                            of instances to the next  whole  number.  If  this
                            value is not specified, the default is 1.

                                          The key of the tag.

                                          Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sen-
                                          sitive and accept a maximum  of  127
                                          Unicode  characters.  May  not begin
                                          with aws: .

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          The value of the tag.

                                          Constraints:    Tag    values    are
                                          case-sensitive  and accept a maximum
                                          of 256 Unicode characters.

                        InstanceRequirements -> (structure)
                            The attributes for the instance  types.  When  you
                            specify instance attributes, Amazon EC2 will iden-
                            tify instance types with those attributes.

                            NOTE:
                               If you specify InstanceRequirements , you can't
                               specify InstanceType .

                                   The  minimum  number of vCPUs. If the value
                                   is 0 , there is no minimum limit.

                               Max -> (integer)
                                   The maximum number of vCPUs. If this param-
                                   eter  is not specified, there is no maximum
                                   limit.

                            MemoryMiB -> (structure)
                               The minimum and maximum amount  of  memory,  in
                               MiB.

                               Min -> (integer)
                                   The  minimum  amount  of memory, in MiB. If
                                   this parameter is not specified,  there  is

                                   The  maximum  amount  of memory, in MiB. If
                                   this parameter is not specified,  there  is
                                   no maximum limit.

                            CpuManufacturers -> (list)
                               The CPU manufacturers to include.

                               o For  instance  types with Intel CPUs, specify
                                 intel .

                               o For instance types with AMD CPUs, specify amd
                                 .

                               o For  instance  types with Amazon Web Services
                                 CPUs, specify amazon-web-services .

                               NOTE:
                                   Don't confuse the CPU manufacturer with the
                                   CPU   architecture.   Instances   will   be
                                   launched with a compatible CPU architecture
                                   based  on  the  Amazon  Machine Image (AMI)
                                   that you specify in your launch template.

                               Default: Any manufacturer

                               (string)

                            MemoryGiBPerVCpu -> (structure)
                               The minimum and maximum amount  of  memory  per
                               vCPU, in GiB.

                               Default: No minimum or maximum limits

                               Min -> (double)
                                   The  minimum  amount of memory per vCPU, in
                                   GiB. If this parameter  is  not  specified,
                                   there is no minimum limit.

                               Max -> (double)
                                   The  maximum  amount of memory per vCPU, in
                                   GiB. If this parameter  is  not  specified,
                                   there is no maximum limit.

                            ExcludedInstanceTypes -> (list)
                               The instance types to exclude.

                               You  can  use  strings  with  one  or more wild
                               cards, represented by an asterisk (* ), to  ex-
                               clude  an  instance  type, size, or generation.
                               The following are examples: m5.8xlarge ,  c5*.*
                               , m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                               For  example,  if  you  specify c5* ,Amazon EC2
                               will exclude the  entire  C5  instance  family,
                               which  includes all C5a and C5n instance types.
                               If you specify m5a.* , Amazon EC2 will  exclude
                               all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n in-
                               stance types.

                               NOTE:
                                   If you specify ExcludedInstanceTypes ,  you
                                   can't specify AllowedInstanceTypes .

                               Default: No excluded instance types

                               (string)

                            InstanceGenerations -> (list)
                               Indicates  whether  current or previous genera-
                               tion instance types are included.  The  current
                               generation  instance  types are recommended for
                               use. Current generation instance types are typ-
                               ically  the  latest two to three generations in
                               each instance family. For more information, see
                               Instance types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                               For  current generation instance types, specify
                               current .

                               For previous generation instance types, specify
                               previous .

                               Default:  Current  and  previous generation in-
                               stance types

                               (string)

                            SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice -> (integer)
                               [Price protection] The price protection thresh-
                               old  for Spot Instances, as a percentage higher
                               than an identified Spot price.  The  identified
                               Spot  price  is  the  Spot  price of the lowest
                               priced current generation C, M, or  R  instance
                               type with your specified attributes. If no cur-
                               rent  generation  C,  M,  or  R  instance  type
                               matches  your  attributes,  then the identified
                               Spot price is from the  lowest  priced  current
                               generation  instance  types,  and failing that,
                               from the lowest priced previous generation  in-
                               stance  types  that match your attributes. When
                               Amazon EC2 selects instance types with your at-
                               tributes,  it will exclude instance types whose
                               Spot price exceeds your specified threshold.

                               The parameter accepts an integer, which  Amazon
                               EC2 interprets as a percentage.

                               If  you  set  TargetCapacityUnitType to vcpu or
                               memory-mib , the price protection threshold  is
                               applied  based  on  the  per-vCPU or per-memory
                               price instead of the per-instance price.

                               This   parameter   is   not    supported    for
                               GetSpotPlacementScores                      and
                               GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements .

                               NOTE:
                                   Only one of  SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLow-

                               identified  On-Demand price is the price of the
                               lowest priced current generation C, M, or R in-
                               stance  type  with  your  specified attributes.
                               When Amazon EC2  selects  instance  types  with
                               your attributes, it will exclude instance types
                               whose price exceeds your specified threshold.

                               The parameter accepts an integer, which  Amazon
                               EC2 interprets as a percentage.

                               To  turn  off  price protection, specify a high
                               value, such as 999999 .

                               This   parameter   is   not    supported    for
                               GetSpotPlacementScores                      and
                               GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements .

                                   If you set TargetCapacityUnitType  to  vcpu
                                   or   memory-mib   ,  the  price  protection
                                   threshold is applied based on the  per-vCPU
                                   or  per-memory price instead of the per-in-
                                   stance price.

                                   The maximum amount of network bandwidth, in
                                   Gbps. If this parameter is  not  specified,
                                   there is no maximum limit.

                            AllowedInstanceTypes -> (list)
                               The  instance types to apply your specified at-
                               tributes against. All other instance types  are
                               ignored,  even if they match your specified at-
                               tributes.

                               You can use  strings  with  one  or  more  wild
                               cards,  represented by an asterisk (* ), to al-
                               low an instance type, size, or generation.  The
                               following  are  examples:  m5.8xlarge , c5*.* ,
                               m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                               For example, if you  specify  c5*  ,Amazon  EC2
                               will allow the entire C5 instance family, which
                               includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you
                               specify  m5a.*  , Amazon EC2 will allow all the
                               M5a instance types, but not  the  M5n  instance
                               types.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  you  specify AllowedInstanceTypes , you
                                   can't specify ExcludedInstanceTypes .

                               Default: All instance types

                               (string)

                            MaxSpotPriceAsPercentageOfOptimalOnDemandPrice  ->
                            (integer)
                               [Price protection] The price protection thresh-
                               old for Spot Instances, as a percentage  of  an
                               identified   On-Demand  price.  The  identified
                               On-Demand price is  the  price  of  the  lowest
                               priced  current  generation C, M, or R instance
                               type with your specified attributes. If no cur-
                               rent  generation  C,  M,  or  R  instance  type
                               matches your attributes,  then  the  identified
                               price is from the lowest priced current genera-
                               tion instance types, and failing that, from the
                               lowest   priced  previous  generation  instance
                               types that match your attributes.  When  Amazon
                               EC2   selects  instance  types  with  your  at-
                               tributes, it will exclude instance types  whose
                               price exceeds your specified threshold.

                               The  parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon
                               EC2 interprets as a percentage.

                               If you set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu or  mem-
                               ory-mib  ,  the  price  protection threshold is
                               based on the per vCPU or per memory  price  in-
                               stead of the per instance price.

                               NOTE:
                                   Only  one of SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLow-

                                   don't specify either, Amazon EC2 will auto-

                 LaunchTemplateConfigs -> (list)
                     The  launch  template  and  overrides.  If  you   specify
                     LaunchTemplateConfigs  , you can't specify LaunchSpecifi-
                     cations . If you include On-Demand capacity in  your  re-
                     quest, you must use LaunchTemplateConfigs .

                     (structure)
                        Describes a launch template and overrides.

                        LaunchTemplateSpecification -> (structure)
                            The  launch  template  to  use. Make sure that the
                            launch template does not contain the NetworkInter-
                            faceId  parameter because you can't specify a net-
                            work interface ID in a Spot Fleet.

                            LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                               The ID of the launch template.

                               You must specify the  LaunchTemplateId  or  the
                               LaunchTemplateName , but not both.

                            LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                               The name of the launch template.

                               You  must specify the LaunchTemplateName or the
                               LaunchTemplateId , but not both.

                            Version -> (string)
                               The launch template version number,  $Latest  ,
                               or  $Default . You must specify a value, other-
                               wise the request fails.

                               If the value is $Latest , Amazon EC2  uses  the
                               latest version of the launch template.

                               If  the value is $Default , Amazon EC2 uses the
                               default version of the launch template.

                        Overrides -> (list)
                            Any parameters that you specify override the  same
                            parameters in the launch template.

                            (structure)
                               Describes overrides for a launch template.

                               InstanceType -> (string)
                                   The instance type.

                               SpotPrice -> (string)
                                   The  maximum  price  per unit hour that you
                                   are willing to pay for a Spot Instance.  We
                                   do  not  recommend using this parameter be-
                                   cause it can lead  to  increased  interrup-
                                   tions.  If  you do not specify this parame-
                                   ter, you will pay the current Spot price.

                                   WARNING:
                                      If you specify a maximum price, your in-
                                      stances  will  be  interrupted more fre-
                                      quently than if you do not specify  this
                                      parameter.

                               SubnetId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the subnet in which to launch the
                                   instances.

                               AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                                   The Availability Zone in  which  to  launch
                                   the instances.

                               WeightedCapacity -> (double)
                                   The  number of units provided by the speci-
                                   fied instance type.

                                   NOTE:
                                      When specifying weights, the price  used
                                      in  the  lowest-price  and  price-capac-
                                      ity-optimized allocation  strategies  is
                                      per  unit hour (where the instance price
                                      is divided  by  the  specified  weight).
                                      However,  if  all  the specified weights
                                      are above the requested TargetCapacity ,
                                      resulting   in  only  1  instance  being
                                      launched, the price used is per instance
                                      hour.

                               Priority -> (double)
                                   The  priority for the launch template over-
                                   ride.  The  highest  priority  is  launched
                                   first.

                                   If  OnDemandAllocationStrategy  is  set  to
                                   prioritized , Spot Fleet uses  priority  to
                                   determine which launch template override to
                                   use first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

                                   If the Spot AllocationStrategy  is  set  to
                                   capacityOptimizedPrioritized  ,  Spot Fleet
                                   uses priority on a best-effort basis to de-
                                   termine  which  launch template override to
                                   use in fulfilling Spot capacity, but  opti-
                                   mizes for capacity first.

                                   Valid  values are whole numbers starting at
                                   0 . The lower the number,  the  higher  the
                                   priority.  If  no number is set, the launch
                                   template override has the lowest  priority.
                                   You can set the same priority for different
                                   launch template overrides.

                               InstanceRequirements -> (structure)
                                   The instance requirements. When you specify
                                   instance   requirements,  Amazon  EC2  will
                                   identify instance types with  the  provided
                                   requirements,  and  then use your On-Demand
                                   and Spot allocation  strategies  to  launch
                                   instances from these instance types, in the
                                   same way as when you specify a list of  in-
                                   stance types.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If  you  specify  InstanceRequirements ,
                                      you can't specify InstanceType .

                                   VCpuCount -> (structure)
                                      The minimum and maximum number of vCPUs.

                                          The minimum number of vCPUs. If  the
                                          value  is  0  ,  there is no minimum
                                          limit.

                                      Max -> (integer)
                                          The maximum number of vCPUs. If this
                                          parameter is not specified, there is
                                          no maximum limit.

                                   MemoryMiB -> (structure)
                                      The minimum and maximum amount  of  mem-
                                      ory, in MiB.

                                      Min -> (integer)
                                          The  minimum  amount  of  memory, in
                                          MiB. If this parameter is not speci-
                                          fied, there is no minimum limit.

                                      Max -> (integer)
                                          The  maximum  amount  of  memory, in
                                          MiB. If this parameter is not speci-

                                      per vCPU, in GiB.

                                      Default: No minimum or maximum limits

                                      Min -> (double)
                                          The  minimum  amount  of  memory per
                                          vCPU, in GiB. If this  parameter  is
                                          not  specified,  there is no minimum
                                          limit.

                                      Max -> (double)
                                          The maximum  amount  of  memory  per
                                          vCPU,  in  GiB. If this parameter is

                                   ExcludedInstanceTypes -> (list)
                                      The instance types to exclude.

                                      You  can  use  strings  with one or more
                                      wild cards, represented by  an  asterisk
                                      (* ), to exclude an instance type, size,
                                      or generation. The following  are  exam-
                                      ples:  m5.8xlarge , c5*.* , m5a.* , r* ,
                                      *3* .

                                      For example, if you specify c5*  ,Amazon
                                      EC2  will exclude the entire C5 instance
                                      family, which includes all C5a  and  C5n
                                      instance  types.  If you specify m5a.* ,
                                      Amazon EC2 will exclude all the M5a  in-
                                      stance  types,  but not the M5n instance
                                      types.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If you specify ExcludedInstanceTypes
                                          , you can't specify AllowedInstance-
                                          Types .

                                      Default: No excluded instance types

                                      (string)

                                   InstanceGenerations -> (list)
                                      Indicates whether  current  or  previous
                                      generation  instance types are included.
                                      The current  generation  instance  types
                                      are recommended for use. Current genera-
                                      tion instance types  are  typically  the
                                      latest  two to three generations in each
                                      instance family. For  more  information,
                                      see  Instance  types  in  the Amazon EC2

                                      For current generation  instance  types,
                                      specify current .

                                      For  previous generation instance types,
                                      specify previous .

                                      price.  The identified Spot price is the
                                      Spot price of the lowest priced  current
                                      generation C, M, or R instance type with
                                      your specified attributes. If no current
                                      generation  C,  M,  or  R  instance type
                                      matches your attributes, then the  iden-
                                      tified  Spot  price  is  from the lowest
                                      priced   current   generation   instance
                                      types, and failing that, from the lowest

                                      types  that  match your attributes. When
                                      Amazon EC2 selects instance  types  with
                                      your  attributes,  it  will  exclude in-
                                      stance types whose  Spot  price  exceeds
                                      your specified threshold.

                                      The  parameter accepts an integer, which
                                      Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage.

                                      If  you  set  TargetCapacityUnitType  to
                                      vcpu  or  memory-mib , the price protec-
                                      tion threshold is applied based  on  the
                                      per-vCPU  or per-memory price instead of
                                      the per-instance price.

                                      The instance types to apply your  speci-
                                      fied  attributes  against. All other in-
                                      stance types are ignored, even  if  they
                                      match your specified attributes.

                                      You  can  use  strings  with one or more
                                      wild cards, represented by  an  asterisk
                                      (*  ),  to allow an instance type, size,
                                      or generation. The following  are  exam-
                                      ples:  m5.8xlarge , c5*.* , m5a.* , r* ,
                                      *3* .

                                      For example, if you specify c5*  ,Amazon
                                      EC2  will  allow  the entire C5 instance
                                      family, which includes all C5a  and  C5n
                                      instance  types.  If you specify m5a.* ,
                                      Amazon EC2 will allow all  the  M5a  in-
                                      stance  types,  but not the M5n instance
                                      types.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If you specify  AllowedInstanceTypes
                                          ,   you  can't  specify  ExcludedIn-

                                      price. The identified On-Demand price is
                                      the  price  of the lowest priced current
                                      generation C, M, or R instance type with
                                      your specified attributes. If no current
                                      generation C,  M,  or  R  instance  type
                                      matches  your attributes, then the iden-
                                      tified price is from the  lowest  priced
                                      current  generation  instance types, and
                                      failing that,  from  the  lowest  priced
                                      previous  generation instance types that
                                      match your attributes. When  Amazon  EC2
                                      selects  instance  types  with  your at-
                                      tributes, it will exclude instance types
                                      whose   price   exceeds  your  specified
                                      threshold.

                                      The parameter accepts an integer,  which
                                      Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage.

                                      If  you  set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu
                                      or memory-mib  ,  the  price  protection
                                      threshold  is  based  on the per vCPU or
                                      per memory price instead of the per  in-

                                          match your attributes,  include  one
                                          of  these  parameters  and specify a
                                          high value, such as 999999 .

                 SpotPrice -> (string)
                     The maximum price per unit hour that you are  willing  to
                     pay  for  a Spot Instance. We do not recommend using this
                     parameter because it can lead to increased interruptions.
                     If  you  do  not specify this parameter, you will pay the
                     current Spot price.

                     WARNING:
                        If you specify a maximum price, your instances will be
                        interrupted more frequently than if you do not specify
                        this parameter.

                 TargetCapacity -> (integer)
                     The number of units to request for the  Spot  Fleet.  You
                     can  choose  to  set  the target capacity in terms of in-
                     stances or a performance characteristic that is important
                     to  your  application workload, such as vCPUs, memory, or
                     I/O. If the request type is maintain , you can specify  a
                     target capacity of 0 and add capacity later.

                 OnDemandTargetCapacity -> (integer)
                     The  number of On-Demand units to request. You can choose
                     to set the target capacity in terms  of  instances  or  a
                     performance  characteristic that is important to your ap-
                     plication workload, such as vCPUs, memory, or I/O. If the
                     request  type  is maintain , you can specify a target ca-
                     pacity of 0 and add capacity later.

                 OnDemandMaxTotalPrice -> (string)
                     The maximum amount per hour for On-Demand Instances  that
                     you're  willing to pay. You can use the onDemandMaxTotal-
                     Price parameter, the spotMaxTotalPrice parameter, or both
                     parameters to ensure that your fleet cost does not exceed
                     your budget. If you set a maximum price per hour for  the
                     On-Demand  Instances  and Spot Instances in your request,
                     Spot Fleet will launch instances  until  it  reaches  the
                     maximum  amount  you're  willing to pay. When the maximum
                     amount you're willing to pay is reached, the fleet  stops
                     launching  instances  even if it hasnt met the target ca-
                     pacity.

                     NOTE:
                        If your fleet includes T instances that are configured
                        as  unlimited , and if their average CPU usage exceeds
                        the baseline utilization, you will incur a charge  for
                        surplus  credits.  The  onDemandMaxTotalPrice does not
                        account for surplus credits, and, if you  use  surplus
                        credits, your final cost might be higher than what you
                        specified for onDemandMaxTotalPrice . For more  infor-
                        mation,  see  Surplus credits can incur charges in the
                        Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                 SpotMaxTotalPrice -> (string)
                     The maximum amount  per  hour  for  Spot  Instances  that
                     you're  willing to pay. You can use the spotMaxTotalPrice
                     parameter, the onDemandMaxTotalPrice parameter,  or  both
                     parameters to ensure that your fleet cost does not exceed
                     your budget. If you set a maximum price per hour for  the
                     On-Demand  Instances  and Spot Instances in your request,
                     Spot Fleet will launch instances  until  it  reaches  the
                     maximum  amount  you're  willing to pay. When the maximum
                     amount you're willing to pay is reached, the fleet  stops
                     launching  instances  even if it hasnt met the target ca-
                     pacity.

                     NOTE:
                        If your fleet includes T instances that are configured
                        as  unlimited , and if their average CPU usage exceeds
                        the baseline utilization, you will incur a charge  for
                        surplus  credits.  The  spotMaxTotalPrice does not ac-
                        count for surplus credits, and,  if  you  use  surplus
                        credits, your final cost might be higher than what you
                        specified for spotMaxTotalPrice .  For  more  informa-

                 TerminateInstancesWithExpiration -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether running Spot Instances  are  terminated
                     when the Spot Fleet request expires.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  request.  Indicates whether the Spot Fleet
                     only requests the target capacity  or  also  attempts  to
                     maintain  it. When this value is request , the Spot Fleet
                     only places the required requests. It does not attempt to
                     replenish  Spot  Instances if capacity is diminished, nor
                     does it submit requests in alternative Spot pools if  ca-
                     pacity  is  not  available. When this value is maintain ,
                     the Spot Fleet maintains the target  capacity.  The  Spot
                     Fleet  places  the required requests to meet capacity and
                     automatically replenishes any interrupted instances.  De-

                     Spot Fleet.

                 ValidFrom -> (timestamp)
                     The start date and time of the  request,  in  UTC  format
                     (YYYY  -MM  -DD  T*HH* :MM :SS Z). By default, Amazon EC2
                     starts fulfilling the request immediately.

                 ValidUntil -> (timestamp)
                     The end date and time of the request, in UTC format (YYYY
                     -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z). After the end date and time, no
                     new Spot Instance requests are placed or able to  fulfill
                     the request. If no value is specified, the Spot Fleet re-
                     quest remains until you cancel it.

                 ReplaceUnhealthyInstances -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether Spot Fleet should replace unhealthy in-
                     stances.

                 InstanceInterruptionBehavior -> (string)
                     The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. The de-
                     fault is terminate .

                 LoadBalancersConfig -> (structure)
                     One or more Classic Load Balancers and target  groups  to
                     attach  to  the  Spot Fleet request. Spot Fleet registers
                     the running Spot Instances  with  the  specified  Classic
                     Load Balancers and target groups.

                     With  Network  Load Balancers, Spot Fleet cannot register
                     instances that have the  following  instance  types:  C1,
                     CC1,  CC2,  CG1, CG2, CR1, CS1, G1, G2, HI1, HS1, M1, M2,
                     M3, and T1.

                     ClassicLoadBalancersConfig -> (structure)
                        The Classic Load Balancers.

                        ClassicLoadBalancers -> (list)
                            One or more Classic Load Balancers.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a Classic Load Balancer.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the load balancer.

                     TargetGroupsConfig -> (structure)
                        The target groups.

                        TargetGroups -> (list)
                            One or more target groups.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a load balancer target group.

                               Arn -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  tar-
                                   get group.

                 InstancePoolsToUseCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  Spot pools across which to allocate your
                     target Spot capacity. Valid only  when  Spot  Allocation-
                     Strategy  is set to lowest-price . Spot Fleet selects the
                     cheapest Spot pools and evenly allocates your target Spot
                     capacity  across  the number of Spot pools that you spec-
                     ify.

                     Note that Spot Fleet attempts to draw Spot Instances from
                     the number of pools that you specify on a best effort ba-
                     sis. If a pool runs out of Spot capacity before  fulfill-
                     ing  your  target  capacity,  Spot Fleet will continue to
                     fulfill your request by drawing from  the  next  cheapest
                     pool.  To  ensure  that  your target capacity is met, you
                     might receive Spot Instances from more than the number of
                     pools that you specified. Similarly, if most of the pools
                     have no Spot capacity, you might receive your full target
                     capacity  from  fewer  than  the number of pools that you
                     specified.

                 Context -> (string)

                 TargetCapacityUnitType -> (string)
                     The unit for the target capacity. You  can  specify  this
                     parameter  only  when using attribute-based instance type
                     selection.

                     Default: units (the number of instances)

                 TagSpecifications -> (list)
                     The key-value pair for tagging the Spot Fleet request  on
                     creation.    The   value   for   ResourceType   must   be
                     spot-fleet-request , otherwise  the  Spot  Fleet  request
                     fails.  To  tag  instances at launch, specify the tags in
                     the launch template (valid only  if  you  use  LaunchTem-
                     plateConfigs  ) or in the `` SpotFleetTagSpecification ``
                     (valid only if you use LaunchSpecifications ). For infor-
                     mation about tagging after launch, see Tag your resources
                     .

                     (structure)
                        The tags to apply to a resource when the  resource  is
                        being  created. When you specify a tag, you must spec-
                        ify the resource type to tag,  otherwise  the  request
                        will fail.

                        NOTE:
                            The Valid Values lists all the resource types that
                            can be tagged. However, the  action  you're  using
                            might  not  support  tagging all of these resource
                            types. If you try to tag a resource type  that  is
                            unsupported  for  the  action you're using, you'll
                            get an error.
