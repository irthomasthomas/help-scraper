GET-AWS-NETWORK-PERFORMANCE-DATA()          GET-AWS-NETWORK-PERFORMANCE-DATA()



NAME
       get-aws-network-performance-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets network performance data.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-aws-network-performance-data is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: DataResponses

OPTIONS
       --data-queries (list)
          A list of network performance data queries.

          (structure)
              A query used for retrieving network health data.

              Id -> (string)
                 A user-defined ID associated with a  data  query  that's  re-
                 turned  in  the dataResponse identifying the query. For exam-
                 ple, if you set the Id to MyQuery01 in the query, the dataRe-
                 sponse identifies the query as MyQuery01 .

              Source -> (string)
                 The  Region  or  Availability  Zone that's the source for the
                 data query. For example, us-east-1 .

              Destination -> (string)
                 The Region or Availability Zone that's  the  target  for  the
                 data query. For example, eu-north-1 .

              Metric -> (string)
                 The metric used for the network performance request.

              Statistic -> (string)
                 The  metric data aggregation period, p50 , between the speci-
                 fied startDate  and  endDate  .  For  example,  a  metric  of
                 five_minutes  is  the  median of all the data points gathered
                 within those five minutes. p50 is the only supported metric.

              Period -> (string)
                 The aggregation period used for the data query.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,Source=string,Destination=string,Metric=string,Statistic=string,Period=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Id": "string",
              "Source": "string",
              "Destination": "string",
              "Metric": "aggregate-latency",
              "Statistic": "p50",
              "Period": "five-minutes"|"fifteen-minutes"|"one-hour"|"three-hours"|"one-day"|"one-week"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The starting time for the performance  data  request.  The  starting
          time  must  be  formatted  as  yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss  .  For  example,
          2022-06-10T12:00:00.000Z .

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The ending time for the performance data request. The end time  must
          be    formatted    as    yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss    .    For    example,
          2022-06-12T12:00:00.000Z .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get network performance data

       The following get-aws-network-performance-data example  retrieves  data
       about  the  network  performance  between  the specified Regions in the
       specified time period.
