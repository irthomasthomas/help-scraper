GET-LAUNCH-TEMPLATE-DATA()                          GET-LAUNCH-TEMPLATE-DATA()



NAME
       get-launch-template-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the configuration data of the specified instance. You can use
       this data to create a launch template.

       This action calls on other describe actions to  get  instance  informa-
       tion.  Depending  on your instance configuration, you may need to allow
       the following actions in your IAM policy:  DescribeSpotInstanceRequests
       ,  DescribeInstanceCreditSpecifications , DescribeVolumes , DescribeIn-
       stanceAttribute , and DescribeElasticGpus . Or, you can allow describe*
       depending on your instance requirements.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get instance data for a launch template

       This example gets data  about  the  specified  instance  and  uses  the
       --query  option  to  return the contents in LaunchTemplateData. You can
       use the output as a base to create a new launch template or launch tem-
       plate version.

       Command:

          aws ec2 get-launch-template-data --instance-id i-0123d646e8048babc --query 'LaunchTemplateData'

                     sion token with any instance metadata retrieval requests.
                     In this state, retrieving the IAM role credentials always
                     returns  IMDSv2  credentials;  IMDSv1 credentials are not
                     available.

                 The instance types to exclude.

                 You  can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented
                 by an asterisk (* ), to exclude an instance  type,  size,  or
                 generation.  The following are examples: m5.8xlarge , c5*.* ,
                 m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                 For example, if you specify c5* ,Amazon EC2 will exclude  the
                 entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n in-
                 stance types. If you specify m5a.* , Amazon EC2 will  exclude
                 all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types.

              SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice -> (integer)
                 The  price  protection  threshold for Spot Instances. This is
                 the maximum youll pay for a Spot  Instance,  expressed  as  a
                 percentage above the least expensive current generation M, C,
                 or R instance type with your specified attributes. When  Ama-
                 zon  EC2  selects instance types with your attributes, it ex-
                 cludes instance types priced above your threshold.

                 The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 interprets
                 as a percentage.

                 To  turn  off price protection, specify a high value, such as
                 999999 .

                 This parameter is not  supported  for  GetSpotPlacementScores
                 and GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements .

                     If you set TargetCapacityUnitType to vcpu or memory-mib ,
                     the price protection threshold is applied  based  on  the
                     per-vCPU  or per-memory price instead of the per-instance
                     price.

                 Default: 100

              OnDemandMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice -> (integer)
                 The price protection threshold for On-Demand Instances.  This
                 is the maximum youll pay for an On-Demand Instance, expressed
                 as a percentage above the least expensive current  generation
                 M, C, or R instance type with your specified attributes. When
                 Amazon EC2 selects instance types with  your  attributes,  it
                 excludes instance types priced above your threshold.

                 The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 interprets
                 as a percentage.

                 To turn off price protection, specify a high value,  such  as
                 999999 .

                 This  parameter  is  not supported for GetSpotPlacementScores
                 and GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements .

                 NOTE:
                     If you set TargetCapacityUnitType to vcpu or memory-mib ,
                     the  price  protection  threshold is applied based on the
                     per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the  per-instance
                     price.

                 Default: 20

              BareMetal -> (string)
