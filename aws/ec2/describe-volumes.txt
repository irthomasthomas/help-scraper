NAME
       describe-volumes -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified EBS volumes or all of your EBS volumes.

       If  you  are  describing  a long list of volumes, we recommend that you
       paginate the output to make the list more manageable. For more informa-
       tion, see Pagination .

       For  more  information about EBS volumes, see Amazon EBS volumes in the
       Amazon EBS User Guide .

       WARNING:
          We strongly recommend using only paginated requests. Unpaginated re-
          quests are susceptible to throttling and timeouts.

       NOTE:
          The  order  of  the elements in the response, including those within
          nested structures, might vary. Applications should  not  assume  the
          elements appear in a particular order.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-volumes  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Volumes

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o attachment.attach-time - The time stamp when the attachment initi-
            ated.

          o attachment.delete-on-termination  -  Whether the volume is deleted
            on instance termination.

          o attachment.device - The device name specified in the block  device
            mapping (for example, /dev/sda1 ).

          o attachment.instance-id  - The ID of the instance the volume is at-
            tached to.

          o attachment.status - The attachment state (attaching |  attached  |
            detaching ).

          o availability-zone  - The Availability Zone in which the volume was
            created.

          o create-time - The time stamp when the volume was created.

          o encrypted - Indicates whether the  volume  is  encrypted  (true  |
            false )

          o multi-attach-enabled - Indicates whether the volume is enabled for
            Multi-Attach (true | false )

          o fast-restored - Indicates whether the volume was  created  from  a
            snapshot  that  is enabled for fast snapshot restore (true | false
            ).

          o size - The size of the volume, in GiB.

          o snapshot-id - The snapshot from which the volume was created.

          o status - The state of the volume (creating | available | in-use  |
            deleting | deleted | error ).

          o tag  :<key>  -  The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
            resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as
            the  filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,  re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o volume-id - The volume ID.

          o volume-type  - The Amazon EBS volume type (gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 |
            st1 | sc1 | standard )

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --volume-ids (list)
          The volume IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 2: To describe volumes that are attached to a specific instance

       The  following  describe-volumes example describes all volumes that are
       both attached to the specified instance and set to delete when the  in-
       stance terminates.

          aws ec2 describe-volumes \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --filters Name=attachment.instance-id,Values=i-1234567890abcdef0 Name=attachment.delete-on-termination,Values=true

       For an example of the output for describe-volumes, see Example 1.

       Example  3:  To  describe  available volumes in a specific Availability
       Zone

       The following describe-volumes example describes all volumes that  have
       a status of available and are in the specified Availability Zone.

          aws ec2 describe-volumes \
              --filters Name=status,Values=available Name=availability-zone,Values=us-east-1a

       For an example of the output for describe-volumes, see Example 1.

       Example 4: To describe volumes based on tags

       The  following describe-volumes example describes all volumes that have
       the tag key Name and a value that begins with Test. The output is  then
       filtered  with  a query that displays only the tags and IDs of the vol-
       umes.

          aws ec2 describe-volumes \
              --filters Name=tag:Name,Values=Test* \
              --query "Volumes[*].{ID:VolumeId,Tag:Tags}"

       Output:

          [
              {
                 "Tag": [
                     {

                 are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this  repre-
                 sents  the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at
                 which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

              Tags -> (list)
                 Any tags assigned to the volume.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

              VolumeType -> (string)
                 The volume type.

              FastRestored -> (boolean)

                 NOTE:
                     This parameter is not returned by CreateVolume.

                 Indicates  whether the volume was created using fast snapshot
                 restore.

              MultiAttachEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether Amazon EBS Multi-Attach is enabled.

              Throughput -> (integer)
                 The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

              SseType -> (string)

                 NOTE:
                     This parameter is not returned by CreateVolume.

                 Reserved for future use.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to include in another request to  get  the  next  page  of
          items. This value is null when there are no more items to return.
