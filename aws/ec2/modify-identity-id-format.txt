MODIFY-IDENTITY-ID-FORMAT()                        MODIFY-IDENTITY-ID-FORMAT()



NAME
       modify-identity-id-format -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  ID  format  of  a resource for a specified IAM user, IAM
       role, or the root user for an account; or all IAM users, IAM roles, and
       the root user for an account. You can specify that resources should re-
       ceive longer IDs (17-character IDs) when they are created.

       This request can only be used to modify longer ID settings for resource
       types  that  are within the opt-in period. Resources currently in their
       opt-in period include: bundle | conversion-task  |  customer-gateway  |
       dhcp-options  |  elastic-ip-allocation  |  elastic-ip-association | ex-
       port-task | flow-log | image | import-task |  internet-gateway  |  net-
       work-acl | network-acl-association | network-interface | network-inter-
       face-attachment | prefix-list | route-table | route-table-association |
       security-group   |  subnet  |  subnet-cidr-block-association  |  vpc  |
       vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint  |  vpc-peering-connection  |
       vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

       For  more  information,  see Resource IDs in the Amazon Elastic Compute
       Cloud User Guide .

       This setting applies to the principal specified in the request; it does
       not apply to the principal that makes the request.

       Resources  created  with  longer  IDs  are visible to all IAM roles and
       users, regardless of these settings and provided that they have permis-
       sion to use the relevant Describe command for the resource type.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-identity-id-format
          --principal-arn <value>
          --resource <value>
          --use-long-ids | --no-use-long-ids
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --principal-arn (string)
          The ARN of the principal, which can be an IAM user, IAM role, or the
          root user. Specify all to modify the ID format for  all  IAM  users,
          IAM roles, and the root user of the account.

       --resource (string)
          The  type of resource: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway |
          dhcp-options | elastic-ip-allocation | elastic-ip-association |  ex-
          port-task | flow-log | image | import-task | internet-gateway | net-
          work-acl | network-acl-association | network-interface | network-in-
          terface-attachment | prefix-list | route-table | route-table-associ-
          ation | security-group | subnet  |  subnet-cidr-block-association  |
          vpc  |  vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint | vpc-peering-con-
          nection | vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

          Alternatively, use the all-current option to  include  all  resource
          types that are currently within their opt-in period for longer IDs.

       --use-long-ids | --no-use-long-ids (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the resource should use longer IDs (17-character
          IDs)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To enable an IAM role to use longer IDs for a resource

       The following modify-identity-id-format example enables  the  IAM  role
       EC2Role  in your AWS account to use long ID format for the instance re-
       source type.

          aws ec2 modify-identity-id-format \
              --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EC2Role \
              --resource instance \
              --use-long-ids

       To enable an IAM user to use longer IDs for a resource

       The following modify-identity-id-format example enables  the  IAM  user
       AdminUser  in your AWS account to use the longer ID format for the vol-
       ume resource type.

          aws ec2 modify-identity-id-format \
              --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/AdminUser \
              --resource volume \
              --use-long-ids

       The following modify-identity-id-format example enables  the  IAM  user
       AdminUser  in your AWS account to use the longer ID format for all sup-
       ported resource types that are within their opt-in period.

          aws ec2 modify-identity-id-format \
              --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/AdminUser \
              --resource all-current \
              --use-long-ids

OUTPUT
       None
