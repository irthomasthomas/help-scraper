CREATE-NAT-GATEWAY()                                      CREATE-NAT-GATEWAY()



NAME
       create-nat-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  NAT  gateway in the specified subnet. This action creates a
       network interface in the specified subnet with  a  private  IP  address
       from the IP address range of the subnet. You can create either a public
       NAT gateway or a private NAT gateway.

       With a public NAT gateway, internet-bound traffic from a private subnet
       can be routed to the NAT gateway, so that instances in a private subnet
       can connect to the internet.

       With a private NAT gateway, private communication is routed across VPCs
       and  on-premises  networks through a transit gateway or virtual private
       gateway. Common use cases include  running  large  workloads  behind  a
       small  pool  of allowlisted IPv4 addresses, preserving private IPv4 ad-
       dresses, and communicating between overlapping networks.

       For more information, see NAT gateways in the Amazon VPC User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --allocation-id (string)
          [Public NAT gateways only] The allocation ID of an  Elastic  IP  ad-
          dress to associate with the NAT gateway. You cannot specify an Elas-
          tic IP address with a private NAT gateway. If the Elastic IP address
          is associated with another resource, you must first disassociate it.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see How to  ensure
          idempotency .

          Constraint: Maximum 64 ASCII characters.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --subnet-id (string)
          The ID of the subnet in which to create the NAT gateway.

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to assign to the NAT gateway.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type
              to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

              NOTE:
                 The Valid Values lists all the resource  types  that  can  be
                 tagged.  However,  the  action you're using might not support
                 tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a  re-
                 source  type that is unsupported for the action you're using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

       --private-ip-address (string)
          The private IPv4 address to assign to the NAT gateway. If you  don't

          signed.

          about  secondary  addresses,  see Create a NAT gateway in the Amazon
          VPC User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a public NAT gateway

       The following create-nat-gateway example creates a public  NAT  gateway
       in  the specified subnet and associates the Elastic IP address with the
       specified allocation ID. When you create a public NAT gateway, you must
       associate an Elastic IP address.

          aws ec2 create-nat-gateway \
              --subnet-id subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE \
              --allocation-id eipalloc-09ad461b0dEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "NatGateway": {
                  "CreateTime": "2021-12-01T22:22:38.000Z",
                  "NatGatewayAddresses": [
                      {
                          "AllocationId": "eipalloc-09ad461b0dEXAMPLE"
                      }
                  ],
                  "NatGatewayId": "nat-0c61bf8a12EXAMPLE",
                  "State": "pending",
                  "SubnetId": "subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE",
                  "VpcId": "vpc-0a60eb65b4EXAMPLE",
                  "ConnectivityType": "public"
              }
          }

       For more information, see NAT gateways in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

       Example 2: To create a private NAT gateway

       The  following create-nat-gateway example creates a private NAT gateway
       in the specified subnet. A private NAT gateway does not have an associ-
       ated Elastic IP address.

          aws ec2 create-nat-gateway \
              --subnet-id subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE \
              --connectivity-type private

       Output:

          {
              "NatGateway": {
                  "CreateTime": "2021-12-01T22:26:00.000Z",
                  "NatGatewayAddresses": [
                      {}
                  ],
                  "NatGatewayId": "nat-011b568379EXAMPLE",
                  "State": "pending",
                  "SubnetId": "subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE",
                  "VpcId": "vpc-0a60eb65b4EXAMPLE",
                  "ConnectivityType": "private"
              }
          }
