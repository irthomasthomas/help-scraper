DETACH-VOLUME()                                                DETACH-VOLUME()



NAME
       detach-volume -

DESCRIPTION
       Detaches  an EBS volume from an instance. Make sure to unmount any file
       systems on the device within your operating system before detaching the
       volume. Failure to do so can result in the volume becoming stuck in the
       busy state while detaching. If this happens, detachment can be  delayed
       indefinitely until you unmount the volume, force detachment, reboot the
       instance, or all three. If an EBS volume is the root device of  an  in-
       stance,  it  can't be detached while the instance is running. To detach
       the root volume, stop the instance first.

       When a volume with an Amazon Web Services Marketplace product  code  is
       detached  from  an  instance,  the product code is no longer associated
       with the instance.

       You can't detach or force detach volumes that are  attached  to  Amazon
       ECS or Fargate tasks. Attempting to do this results in the Unsupported-
       OperationException exception with the Unable to detach volume  attached
       to ECS tasks error message.

       For more information, see Detach an Amazon EBS volume in the Amazon EBS
       User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --device (string)
          The device name.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          Forces detachment if the previous detachment attempt did  not  occur
          cleanly  (for example, logging into an instance, unmounting the vol-
          ume, and detaching normally). This option can lead to data loss or a
          corrupted  file system. Use this option only as a last resort to de-
          tach a volume from a failed instance. The instance won't have an op-
          portunity  to  flush  file system caches or file system metadata. If
          you use this option, you must perform file system check  and  repair
          procedures.

       --instance-id (string)
          The  ID of the instance. If you are detaching a Multi-Attach enabled
          volume, you must specify an instance ID.

       --volume-id (string)
          The ID of the volume.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detach a volume from an instance

       This  example  command detaches the volume (vol-049df61146c4d7901) from
       the instance it is attached to.

       Command:

          aws ec2 detach-volume --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0

       Output:

          {
              "AttachTime": "2014-02-27T19:23:06.000Z",
              "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
              "VolumeId": "vol-049df61146c4d7901",
              "State": "detaching",
              "Device": "/dev/sdb"
          }

OUTPUT
       AttachTime -> (timestamp)
          The time stamp when the attachment initiated.

       Device -> (string)
          The device name.

          If the volume is attached to a Fargate task, this parameter  returns
          null .

       InstanceId -> (string)
          The ID of the instance.

          If  the volume is attached to a Fargate task, this parameter returns
          null .

       State -> (string)
          The attachment state of the volume.

       VolumeId -> (string)
          The ID of the volume.

       DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.

       AssociatedResource -> (string)
          The ARN of the Amazon ECS or Fargate task to which the volume is at-
          tached.

       InstanceOwningService -> (string)
          The  service  principal of Amazon Web Services service that owns the
          underlying instance to which the volume is attached.

          This parameter is returned only for volumes  that  are  attached  to
          Fargate tasks.
