CREATE-ROUTE()                                                  CREATE-ROUTE()



NAME
       create-route -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a route in a route table within a VPC.

       You  must  specify either a destination CIDR block or a prefix list ID.
       You must also specify exactly one of the resources from  the  parameter
       list.

       When  determining  how to route traffic, we use the route with the most
       specific match. For example, traffic is destined for the  IPv4  address
       192.0.2.3 , and the route table includes the following two IPv4 routes:

       o 192.0.2.0/24 (goes to some target A)

       o 192.0.2.0/28 (goes to some target B)

       Both  routes apply to the traffic destined for 192.0.2.3 . However, the
       second route in the list covers a smaller number of IP addresses and is
       therefore  more  specific,  so  we use that route to determine where to
       target the traffic.

       For more information about route tables, see Route tables in the Amazon
       Virtual Private Cloud User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --destination-cidr-block (string)
          The  IPv4 CIDR address block used for the destination match. Routing
          decisions are based on the most specific match. We modify the speci-
          fied  CIDR  block to its canonical form; for example, if you specify
          100.68.0.18/18 , we modify it to 100.68.0.0/18 .

       --destination-ipv6-cidr-block (string)
          The IPv6 CIDR block used for the destination  match.  Routing  deci-
          sions are based on the most specific match.

       --destination-prefix-list-id (string)
          The ID of a prefix list used for the destination match.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --vpc-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of a VPC endpoint. Supported for Gateway Load  Balancer  end-
          points only.

       --egress-only-internet-gateway-id (string)
          [IPv6 traffic only] The ID of an egress-only internet gateway.

       --gateway-id (string)
          The ID of an internet gateway or virtual private gateway attached to
          your VPC.

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of a NAT instance in your VPC. The  operation  fails  if  you
          specify  an  instance ID unless exactly one network interface is at-
          tached.

       --nat-gateway-id (string)
          [IPv4 traffic only] The ID of a NAT gateway.

       --transit-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of a transit gateway.

       --local-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the local gateway.

       --carrier-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the carrier gateway.

          You can only use this option when the VPC contains a subnet which is
          associated with a Wavelength Zone.

       --network-interface-id (string)
          The ID of a network interface.

       --route-table-id (string)
          The ID of the route table for the route.

       --vpc-peering-connection-id (string)
          The ID of a VPC peering connection.

       --core-network-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the core network.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a route

       This  example  creates a route for the specified route table. The route
       matches all IPv4 traffic (0.0.0.0/0) and routes it to the specified In-
       ternet gateway. If the command succeeds, no output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-22574640 --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 --gateway-id igw-c0a643a9

       This  example  command creates a route in route table rtb-g8ff4ea2. The
       route matches traffic for the IPv4 CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16 and routes it
       to  VPC peering connection, pcx-111aaa22. This route enables traffic to
       be directed to the peer VPC in the VPC peering connection. If the  com-
       mand succeeds, no output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-g8ff4ea2 --destination-cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --vpc-peering-connection-id pcx-1a2b3c4d

       This  example creates a route in the specified route table that matches
       all IPv6 traffic (::/0) and routes it to the specified egress-only  In-
       ternet gateway.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-dce620b8 --destination-ipv6-cidr-block ::/0 --egress-only-internet-gateway-id eigw-01eadbd45ecd7943f

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns  true  if the request succeeds; otherwise, it returns an er-
          ror.
