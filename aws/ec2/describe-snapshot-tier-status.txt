DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOT-TIER-STATUS()                DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOT-TIER-STATUS()



NAME
       describe-snapshot-tier-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the storage tier status of one or more Amazon EBS snapshots.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-snapshot-tier-status  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: SnapshotTierStatuses

SYNOPSIS
            describe-snapshot-tier-status
          [--filters <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o snapshot-id - The snapshot ID.

          o volume-id - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.

          o last-tiering-operation - The state of the last archive or  restore
            action.     (archival-in-progress     |    archival-completed    |
            archival-failed |  permanent-restore-in-progress  |  permanent-re-
            store-completed   |   permanent-restore-failed   |   temporary-re-
            store-in-progress |  temporary-restore-completed  |  temporary-re-
            store-failed )

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To view archived and standard tier snapshots

       The   following   describe-snapshot-tier-status  example  displays  the
       archived and standard tier snapshots.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --snapshot-ids snap-01234567890abcedf

       Output:

          {
              "Snapshots": [
                  {
                      "Description": "Snap A",
                      "Encrypted": false,
                      "VolumeId": "vol-01234567890aaaaaa",
                      "State": "completed",
                      "VolumeSize": 8,
                      "StartTime": "2021-09-07T21:00:00.000Z",
                      "Progress": "100%",
                      "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "SnapshotId": "snap-01234567890aaaaaa",
                      "StorageTier": "archive",
                      "Tags": []
                  },
                  {
                      "Description": "Snap B",
                      "Encrypted": false,
                      "VolumeId": "vol-09876543210bbbbbb",
                      "State": "completed",
                      "VolumeSize": 10,
                      "StartTime": "2021-09-14T21:00:00.000Z",
                      "Progress": "100%",
                      "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "SnapshotId": "snap-09876543210bbbbbb",
                      "StorageTier": "standard",
                      "RestoreExpiryTime": "2019-09-19T21:00:00.000Z",
                      "Tags": []
                  },
                  {
                      "Description": "Snap C",
                      "Encrypted": false,
                      "VolumeId": "vol-054321543210cccccc",
                      "State": "completed",
                      "VolumeSize": 12,
                      "StartTime": "2021-08-01T21:00:00.000Z",
                      "Progress": "100%",
                      "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "SnapshotId": "snap-054321543210cccccc",
                      "StorageTier": "standard",
                      "Tags": []
                  }
              ]
          }

       The StorageTier response parameter indicates whether  the  snapshot  is
       currently  archived.  archive  indicates that the snapshot is currently
       archived and stored in the archive tier, and  standard  indicates  that
       the  snapshot  is  currently  not archived and that it is stored in the
       standard tier. In this example, only Snap A is  archived.  Snap  B  and
       Snap C are not archived.

       Additionally, the RestoreExpiryTime response parameter is returned only
       for snapshots that are temporarily restored from the archive. It  indi-
       cates  when  temporarily restored snapshots are to be automatically re-
       moved from the standard tier. It is not returned for snapshots that are
       permanently restored.

       In  this example output, Snap C is temporarily restored, and it will be
       automatically     removed     from     the     standard     tier     at
       2021-09-19T21:00:00.000Z (September 19, 2021 at 21:00 UTC).

       For  more  information about snapshot archiving, see Archive Amazon EBS
       snapshots in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 2: To view only snapshots that are stored in the archive tier

       The following describe-snapshot-tier-status example displays only snap-
       shots  that are stored in the archive tier. Include the --filter option
       for the filter name, specify storage-tier, and for  the  filter  value,
       specify archive.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
               --filters "Name=storage-tier,Values=archive"

       Output:

          {
              "Snapshots": [
                  {
                      "Description": "Snap A",
                      "Encrypted": false,
                      "VolumeId": "vol-01234567890aaaaaa",
                      "State": "completed",
                      "VolumeSize": 8,
                      "StartTime": "2021-09-07T21:00:00.000Z",
                      "Progress": "100%",
                      "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "SnapshotId": "snap-01234567890aaaaaa",
                      "StorageTier": "archive",
                      "Tags": []
                  },
              ]
          }
