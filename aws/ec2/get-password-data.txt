GET-PASSWORD-DATA()                                        GET-PASSWORD-DATA()



NAME
       get-password-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  encrypted  administrator password for a running Windows
       instance.

       The Windows password is generated at boot by the EC2Config  service  or
       EC2Launch  scripts  (Windows  Server 2016 and later). This usually only
       happens the first time an instance is launched. For  more  information,
       see EC2Config and EC2Launch in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       For  the EC2Config service, the password is not generated for rebundled
       AMIs unless Ec2SetPassword is enabled before bundling.

       The password is encrypted using the key pair that  you  specified  when
       you  launched the instance. You must provide the corresponding key pair
       file.

       When you launch an instance, password  generation  and  encryption  may
       take  a  few  minutes.  If you try to retrieve the password before it's
       available, the output returns an empty string. We  recommend  that  you
       wait  up to 15 minutes after launching an instance before trying to re-
       trieve the generated password.

SYNOPSIS
            get-password-data
          --instance-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--priv-launch-key <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]

          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the Windows instance.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required permissions for the  operation,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --priv-launch-key (string)
          The  file  that contains the private key used to launch the instance
          (e.g. windows-keypair.pem). If this is supplied, the  password  data
          sent from EC2 will be decrypted before display.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
