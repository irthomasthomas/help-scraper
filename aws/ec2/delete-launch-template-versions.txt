NAME
       delete-launch-template-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  one  or  more versions of a launch template. You cannot delete
       the default version of a launch template; you must first assign a  dif-
       ferent  version as the default. If the default version is the only ver-
       sion for the launch template, you must delete the  entire  launch  tem-
       plate using  DeleteLaunchTemplate .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-launch-template-versions
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--launch-template-id <value>]
          [--launch-template-name <value>]
          --versions <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --launch-template-id (string)
          The ID of the launch template.

          You must specify either the LaunchTemplateId or the  LaunchTemplate-
          Name , but not both.

       --launch-template-name (string)
          The name of the launch template.

          You  must  specify  either  the LaunchTemplateName or the LaunchTem-
          plateId , but not both.

       --versions (list)
          The version numbers of one  or  more  launch  template  versions  to
          delete.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
