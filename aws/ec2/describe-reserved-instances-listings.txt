NAME
       describe-reserved-instances-listings -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes your account's Reserved Instance listings in the Reserved In-
       stance Marketplace.

       The Reserved Instance Marketplace matches sellers who  want  to  resell
       Reserved  Instance  capacity  that  they no longer need with buyers who
       want to purchase additional capacity.  Reserved  Instances  bought  and
       sold  through the Reserved Instance Marketplace work like any other Re-
       served Instances.

       As a seller, you choose to list some or all of your Reserved Instances,
       and  you  specify  the upfront price to receive for them. Your Reserved
       Instances are then listed in the Reserved Instance Marketplace and  are
       available for purchase.

       As  a  buyer, you specify the configuration of the Reserved Instance to
       purchase, and the Marketplace matches what you're  searching  for  with
       what's  available.  The  Marketplace  first sells the lowest priced Re-
       served Instances to you, and continues to sell available  Reserved  In-
       stance  listings to you until your demand is met. You are charged based
       on the total price of all of the listings that you purchase.

       For more information, see Sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace  in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       NOTE:
          The  order  of  the elements in the response, including those within
          nested structures, might vary. Applications should  not  assume  the
          elements appear in a particular order.

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o reserved-instances-id - The ID of the Reserved Instances.

          o reserved-instances-listing-id  -  The ID of the Reserved Instances
            listing.

          o status - The status of the Reserved Instance  listing  (pending  |
            active | cancelled | closed ).

          o status-message - The reason for the status.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --reserved-instances-id (string)
          One or more Reserved Instance IDs.

       --reserved-instances-listing-id (string)
          One or more Reserved Instance listing IDs.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI

                 that the request is idempotent.  For  more  information,  see
                 Ensuring Idempotency .

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)

              PriceSchedules -> (list)
                 The price of the Reserved Instance listing.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the price for a Reserved Instance.

                        A  specific  price  schedule  is always in effect, but
                        only one price schedule can be  active  at  any  time.
                        Take,  for  example,  a Reserved Instance listing that
                        has five months remaining in its term. When you  spec-
                        ify  price  schedules  for five months and two months,
                        this means that schedule 1, covering the  first  three
                        months  of  the  remaining term, will be active during
                        months 5, 4, and 3. Then schedule 2, covering the last
                        two  months  of  the term, will be active for months 2
                        and 1.

                     CurrencyCode -> (string)
                        The currency for transacting the Reserved Instance re-

                        The number of months remaining in the reservation. For
                        example,  2 is the second to the last month before the
                        capacity reservation expires.

              ReservedInstancesId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Reserved Instance.
