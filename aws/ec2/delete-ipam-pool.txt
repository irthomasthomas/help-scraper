NAME
       delete-ipam-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete an IPAM pool.

       NOTE:
          You  cannot  delete  an  IPAM pool if there are allocations in it or
          CIDRs   provisioned   to   it.   To   release    allocations,    see
          ReleaseIpamPoolAllocation   .   To   deprovision   pool  CIDRs,  see
          DeprovisionIpamPoolCidr .

       For more information, see Delete a pool in the  Amazon  VPC  IPAM  User
       Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the pool to delete.

       --cascade | --no-cascade (boolean)
          Enables you to quickly delete an IPAM pool and all resources  within
          that  pool,  including  provisioned  CIDRs,  allocations,  and other
          pools.

          WARNING:
              You can only use this option to  delete  pools  in  the  private
              scope  or  pools  in  the public scope with a source resource. A
              source resource is a resource used to provision CIDRs to  a  re-
              source planning pool.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete an IPAM pool

       In  this  example, you're a IPAM delegated admin who wants to delete an
       IPAM pool that you no longer need, but the pool has a CIDR  provisioned
       to  it.  You cannot delete a pool if it has CIDRs provisioned to it un-
       less you use the --cascade option, so you'll use --cascade.

       To complete this request:

       o You'll  need  the   IPAM   pool   ID   which   you   can   get   with
         describe-ipam-pools.

       o The --region must be the IPAM home Region.

       The following delete-ipam-pool example deletes an IPAM pool in your AWS
       account.

          aws ec2 delete-ipam-pool \
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-050c886a3ca41cd5b \
              --cascade \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "IpamPool": {
                  "OwnerId": "320805250157",
                  "IpamPoolId": "ipam-pool-050c886a3ca41cd5b",

                  "IpamRegion": "us-east-1",
                  "Locale": "None",
                  "PoolDepth": 1,

                  "Description": "example",
                  "AutoImport": false,
                  "AddressFamily": "ipv4",
                  "AllocationMinNetmaskLength": 0,

OUTPUT
       IpamPool -> (structure)
          Information about the results of the deletion.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Web  Services  account  ID of the owner of the IPAM
              pool.

          IpamPoolId -> (string)
              The ID of the IPAM pool.

          SourceIpamPoolId -> (string)
              The ID of the source IPAM pool. You can use this option to  cre-
              ate an IPAM pool within an existing source pool.

          IpamPoolArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IPAM pool.

          IpamScopeArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the scope of the IPAM pool.

          IpamScopeType -> (string)
              In  IPAM, a scope is the highest-level container within IPAM. An
              IPAM contains two default scopes. Each scope represents  the  IP
              space  for  a  single network. The private scope is intended for
              all private IP address space. The public scope is  intended  for
              all  public  IP address space. Scopes enable you to reuse IP ad-
              dresses across multiple unconnected networks without causing  IP
              address overlap or conflict.

          IpamArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IPAM.

          IpamRegion -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region of the IPAM pool.

          Locale -> (string)
              The  locale  of the IPAM pool. In IPAM, the locale is the Amazon
              Web Services Region or, for IPAM IPv4 pools in the public scope,
              the  network  border group for an Amazon Web Services Local Zone
              where you want to make an IPAM pool available for allocations (-
              supported  Local  Zones  ). If you choose an Amazon Web Services
              Region for locale that has not been configured as  an  operating
              Region for the IPAM, you'll get an error.

          PoolDepth -> (integer)
              The  depth  of  pools in your IPAM pool. The pool depth quota is
              10. For more information, see Quotas in IPAM in the  Amazon  VPC
              IPAM User Guide .

          State -> (string)
              The state of the IPAM pool.

          StateMessage -> (string)
              The state message.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the IPAM pool.

          AutoImport -> (boolean)
              If  selected,  IPAM  will continuously look for resources within
              the CIDR range of this pool and automatically import them as al-
              locations  into  your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for
              these resources must not already be allocated to other resources
              in  order for the import to succeed. IPAM will import a CIDR re-
              gardless of its compliance with the pool's allocation rules,  so
              a  resource might be imported and subsequently marked as noncom-
              pliant. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will
              import  the  largest CIDR only. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs
              with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly import one of them only.

              A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.

          PubliclyAdvertisable -> (boolean)
              Determines if a pool is publicly advertisable.  This  option  is
              not available for pools with AddressFamily set to ipv4 .

          AddressFamily -> (string)
              The address family of the pool.

          AllocationMinNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The minimum netmask length required for CIDR allocations in this
              IPAM pool to be compliant. The minimum netmask  length  must  be
              less  than  the maximum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths
              for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6
              addresses are 0 - 128.

          AllocationMaxNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The maximum netmask length possible for CIDR allocations in this
              IPAM pool to be compliant. The maximum netmask  length  must  be
              greater  than  the  minimum  netmask  length.  Possible  netmask
              lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask  lengths
              for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.

          AllocationDefaultNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The  default  netmask length for allocations added to this pool.
              If, for example, the CIDR assigned to this  pool  is  10.0.0.0/8
              and   you  enter  16  here,  new  allocations  will  default  to
              10.0.0.0/16.

          AllocationResourceTags -> (list)
              Tags that are required for resources that use  CIDRs  from  this
              IPAM pool. Resources that do not have these tags will not be al-
              lowed to allocate space from the pool.  If  the  resources  have
              their tags changed after they have allocated space or if the al-
              location tagging requirements are changed on the pool,  the  re-
              source may be marked as noncompliant.

              (structure)
                 The  key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
                 Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as  the
                 filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
                 tag with  the  key  Owner  and  the  value  TeamA  ,  specify
                 tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
                     ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a  specific
                     key, regardless of the tag value.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use
              the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as  the  filter
              value.  For  example, to find all resources that have a tag with
              the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify  tag:Owner  for  the
              filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  keys  are  case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 127 Unicode characters.  May  not  begin  with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  values are case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

          AwsService -> (string)
              Limits which service in Amazon Web Services that the pool can be
              used in. "ec2", for example, allows users to use space for Elas-
              tic IP addresses and VPCs.

          PublicIpSource -> (string)
              The IP address source for pools in the public scope.  Only  used
              for  provisioning IP address CIDRs to pools in the public scope.
              Default is BYOIP . For more information, see Create  IPv6  pools
              in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide . By default, you can add only
              one Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block to a  top-level  IPv6  pool.
              For  information on increasing the default limit, see Quotas for
              your IPAM in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

          SourceResource -> (structure)
              The resource used to provision  CIDRs  to  a  resource  planning
              pool.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The source resource ID.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The source resource type.

              ResourceRegion -> (string)
                 The source resource Region.

              ResourceOwner -> (string)
                 The source resource owner.
