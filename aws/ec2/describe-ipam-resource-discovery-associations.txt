DESCRIBE-IPAM-RESOURCE-DISCOVERDESCRIBE-IPAM-RESOURCE-DISCOVERY-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       describe-ipam-resource-discovery-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  resource  discovery  association with an Amazon VPC IPAM. An
       associated resource discovery is a resource discovery that has been as-
       sociated with an IPAM..

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-ipam-resource-discovery-associations is a paginated operation.
       Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data
       set  of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-pagi-
       nate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults of the following query expressions: IpamResourceDiscoveryAssocia-
       tions

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-resource-discovery-association-ids (list)
          The resource discovery association IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          The resource discovery association filters.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view all resource discovery associations with your IPAM

       In this example, you're a IPAM delegated admin who has  associated  re-
       source discoveries with your IPAM to integrate other accounts with your
       IPAM. You've noticed that your IPAM is not discovering the resources in
       the  operating  Regions of the resource discovery as expected. You want
       to check the status and state of the resource discovery to ensure  that
       the  account that created it is still active and the resource discovery
       is still being shared.

       The --region must be the home Region of your IPAM.

       The  following  describe-ipam-resource-discovery-associations   example
       lists the resource discovery associations in your AWS account.

          aws ec2 describe-ipam-resource-discovery-associations \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociations": [
                  {
                      "OwnerId": "320805250157",

                      "ResourceDiscoveryStatus": "active",
                      "State": "associate-complete",
                      "Tags": []
                  },
                  {
                      "OwnerId": "149977607591",
                      "IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociationId": "ipam-res-disco-assoc-0dfd21ae189ab5f62",
                      "IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociationArn": "arn:aws:ec2::149977607591:ipam-resource-discovery-association/ipam-res-disco-assoc-0dfd21ae189ab5f62",
                      "IpamResourceDiscoveryId": "ipam-res-disco-0365d2977fc1672fe",
                      "IpamId": "ipam-005f921c17ebd5107",
                      "IpamArn": "arn:aws:ec2::149977607591:ipam/ipam-005f921c17ebd5107",

                      "ResourceDiscoveryStatus": "active",
                      "State": "create-complete",
                      "Tags": []
                  }
              ]
          }

       In  this  example, after running this command, you notice that you have
       one non-default resource discovery  ("IsDefault":  false  ``)  that  is
       ``"ResourceDiscoveryStatus":   "not-found"  and  "State":  "create-com-
       plete". The resource discovery owner's account has been closed. If,  in
       another case, you notice that is "ResourceDiscoveryStatus": "not-found"
       and "State": "associate-complete", this indicates that one of the  fol-
       lowing has happened:

       o The resource discovery was deleted by the resource discovery owner.

       o The resource discovery owner unshared the resource discovery.

       organization in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide.

OUTPUT
       IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociations -> (list)
          The resource discovery associations.

          (structure)
              An IPAM resource discovery association. An  associated  resource
              discovery  is a resource discovery that has been associated with
              an IPAM. IPAM aggregates the resource CIDRs  discovered  by  the
              associated resource discovery.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services account ID of the resource discovery
                 owner.

              IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociationId -> (string)
                 The resource discovery association ID.

              IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociationArn -> (string)
                 The  resource  discovery  association  Amazon  Resource  Name
                 (ARN).

              IpamResourceDiscoveryId -> (string)
                 The resource discovery ID.

              IpamId -> (string)
                 The IPAM ID.

              IpamArn -> (string)
                 The IPAM ARN.

              IpamRegion -> (string)
                 The IPAM home Region.

              IsDefault -> (boolean)
                 Defines  if  the  resource discovery is the default. When you
                 create an IPAM, a default resource discovery is  created  for
                 your IPAM and it's associated with your IPAM.

              ResourceDiscoveryStatus -> (string)
                 The resource discovery status.

                 o active - Connection or permissions required to read the re-
                   sults of the resource discovery are intact.

                 o not-found - Connection or permissions required to read  the
                   results of the resource discovery are broken. This may hap-
                   pen if the owner of the resource discovery stopped  sharing
                   it  or  deleted the resource discovery. Verify the resource
                   discovery still exists and the Amazon Web Services RAM  re-
                   source share is still intact.

              State -> (string)
                 The  lifecycle state of the association when you associate or
                 disassociate a resource discovery.

                 o associate-in-progress - Resource discovery is being associ-
                   ated.

                 o associate-complete - Resource discovery association is com-
                   plete.

                 o associate-failed  -  Resource  discovery  association   has
                   failed.

                 o disassociate-in-progress - Resource discovery is being dis-
                   associated.

                 o disassociate-complete - Resource  discovery  disassociation
                   is complete.

                 o disassociate-failed - Resource discovery disassociation has
                   failed.

                 o isolate-in-progress - Amazon Web Services account that cre-
                   ated  the  resource  discovery association has been removed
                   and the resource discovery associatation is being isolated.

                 o isolate-complete - Resource  discovery  isolation  is  com-
                   plete..

                 o restore-in-progress - Resource discovery is being restored.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A  tag  is  a label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services
                 resource. Each tag consists of a key and an  optional  value.
                 You can use tags to search and filter your resources or track
                 your Amazon Web Services costs.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Specify the pagination token from a previous request to retrieve the
          next page of results.
