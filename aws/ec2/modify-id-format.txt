MODIFY-ID-FORMAT()                                          MODIFY-ID-FORMAT()



NAME
       modify-id-format -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  ID format for the specified resource on a per-Region ba-
       sis. You can specify that resources should receive longer IDs (17-char-
       acter IDs) when they are created.

       This request can only be used to modify longer ID settings for resource
       types that are within the opt-in period. Resources currently  in  their
       opt-in  period  include:  bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway |
       dhcp-options | elastic-ip-allocation  |  elastic-ip-association  |  ex-
       port-task  |  flow-log  | image | import-task | internet-gateway | net-
       work-acl | network-acl-association | network-interface | network-inter-
       face-attachment | prefix-list | route-table | route-table-association |
       security-group  |  subnet  |  subnet-cidr-block-association  |  vpc   |
       vpc-cidr-block-association  |  vpc-endpoint  | vpc-peering-connection |
       vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

       This setting applies to the IAM user who makes the request; it does not
       apply  to  the  entire  Amazon Web Services account. By default, an IAM
       user defaults to the same settings as the root user.  If  you're  using
       this  action  as the root user, then these settings apply to the entire
       account, unless an IAM user explicitly  overrides  these  settings  for
       themselves.  For more information, see Resource IDs in the Amazon Elas-
       tic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       Resources created with longer IDs are visible  to  all  IAM  roles  and
       users, regardless of these settings and provided that they have permis-
       sion to use the relevant Describe command for the resource type.

OPTIONS
       --resource (string)
          The type of resource: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway  |
          dhcp-options  | elastic-ip-allocation | elastic-ip-association | ex-
          port-task | flow-log | image | import-task | internet-gateway | net-
          work-acl | network-acl-association | network-interface | network-in-
          terface-attachment | prefix-list | route-table | route-table-associ-
          ation  |  security-group  | subnet | subnet-cidr-block-association |
          vpc | vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint  |  vpc-peering-con-
          nection | vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

          Alternatively,  use  the  all-current option to include all resource
          types that are currently within their opt-in period for longer IDs.

       --use-long-ids | --no-use-long-ids (boolean)
          Indicate whether the resource should use  longer  IDs  (17-character
          IDs).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To enable the longer ID format for a resource

       The following modify-id-format example enables the longer ID format for
       the instance resource type.

          aws ec2 modify-id-format \
              --resource instance \
              --use-long-ids

       To disable the longer ID format for a resource

       The following modify-id-format example disables the  longer  ID  format
       for the instance resource type.

          aws ec2 modify-id-format \
              --resource instance \
              --no-use-long-ids

       The following modify-id-format example enables the longer ID format for
       all supported resource types that are within their opt-in period.

          aws ec2 modify-id-format \
              --resource all-current \
              --use-long-ids

OUTPUT
       None
