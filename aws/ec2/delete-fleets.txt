DELETE-FLEETS()                                                DELETE-FLEETS()



NAME
       delete-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified EC2 Fleet.

       After you delete an EC2 Fleet, it launches no new instances.

       You  must specify whether a deleted EC2 Fleet should also terminate its
       instances. If you choose to terminate the instances, the EC2 Fleet  en-
       ters the deleted_terminating state. Otherwise, the EC2 Fleet enters the
       deleted_running state, and the instances continue to run until they are
       interrupted or you terminate them manually.

       For  instant  fleets,  EC2  Fleet must terminate the instances when the
       fleet is deleted. A deleted instant fleet with running instances is not
       supported.
          Restrictions

       o You  can  delete  up to 25 instant fleets in a single request. If you
         exceed this number, no instant fleets are deleted and an error is re-
         turned. There is no restriction on the number of fleets of type main-
         tain or request that can be deleted in a single request.

       o Up to 1000 instances can be terminated in a single request to  delete
         instant fleets.

       For  more  information,  see Delete an EC2 Fleet in the Amazon EC2 User
       Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --fleet-ids (list)
          The IDs of the EC2 Fleets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --terminate-instances | --no-terminate-instances (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  to terminate the instances when the EC2 Fleet is
          deleted. The default is to terminate the instances.

          To let the instances continue to run after the EC2 Fleet is deleted,
          specify  NoTerminateInstances  .  Supported  only for fleets of type
          maintain and request .

          For instant fleets, you  cannot  specify  NoTerminateInstances  .  A
          deleted instant fleet with running instances is not supported.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete an EC2 Fleet

       The following delete-fleets example deletes the specified EC2 Fleet and
       terminates the associated instances.

              --fleet-ids fleet-12a34b55-67cd-8ef9-ba9b-9208dEXAMPLE \
              --terminate-instances

       Output:
