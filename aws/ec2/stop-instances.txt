STOP-INSTANCES()                                              STOP-INSTANCES()



NAME
       stop-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance. For more information, see Stop and
       start Amazon EC2 instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       You can use the Stop action to hibernate an instance if the instance is
       enabled  for  hibernation  and it meets the hibernation prerequisites .
       For more information, see Hibernate your Amazon  EC2  instance  in  the
       Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       We  don't  charge  usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees;
       however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to
       persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Ev-
       ery time you start your instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute mini-
       mum  for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance
       usage.

       You can't stop or hibernate instance store-backed instances. You  can't
       use  the  Stop  action to hibernate Spot Instances, but you can specify
       that Amazon EC2 should hibernate Spot Instances when  they  are  inter-
       rupted.  For  more  information,  see  Hibernating interrupted Spot In-
       stances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       When you stop or hibernate an  instance,  we  shut  it  down.  You  can
       restart  your  instance  at any time. Before stopping or hibernating an
       instance, make sure it is in a state from which it  can  be  restarted.
       Stopping  an  instance does not preserve data stored in RAM, but hiber-
       nating an instance does preserve data stored in  RAM.  If  an  instance
       cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs.

       Stopping  and hibernating an instance is different to rebooting or ter-
       minating it. For example, when you stop or hibernate an  instance,  the
       root  device  and  any  other devices attached to the instance persist.
       When you terminate an instance, the root device and any  other  devices
       attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more
       information about the differences between rebooting,  stopping,  hiber-
       nating, and terminating instances, see Instance lifecycle in the Amazon
       EC2 User Guide .

       When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after  a
       short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after
       a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying  host  com-
       puter. For more information, see Troubleshoot stopping your instance in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The IDs of the instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --hibernate | --no-hibernate (boolean)
          Hibernates the instance if the instance was enabled for  hibernation
          at  launch.  If the instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal
          shutdown occurs. For more information, see Hibernate  your  instance
          in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

          Default: false

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          Forces the instances to stop. The instances do not have an  opportu-
          nity to flush file system caches or file system metadata. If you use
          this option, you must perform file system check  and  repair  proce-
          dures. This option is not recommended for Windows instances.

          Default: false

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To stop an Amazon EC2 instance

       The  following  stop-instances  example  stops  the  specified   Amazon
       EBS-backed instance.

          aws ec2 stop-instances \
              --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0

       Output:

          {
              "StoppingInstances": [
                  {
                      "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
                      "CurrentState": {
                          "Code": 64,
                          "Name": "stopping"
                      },
                      "PreviousState": {
                          "Code": 16,
                          "Name": "running"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

       Example 2: To hibernate an Amazon EC2 instance

       The following stop-instances example hibernates Amazon  EBS-backed  in-
       stance  if the instance is enabled for hibernation and meets the hiber-
       nation prerequisites.  After the instance is put into  hibernation  the
       instance is stopped.

          aws ec2 stop-instances \
              --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 \
              --hibernate

       Output:

          {
              "StoppingInstances": [
                  {
                      "CurrentState": {
                          "Code": 64,
                          "Name": "stopping"
                      },
                      "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
                      "PreviousState": {
                          "Code": 16,
                          "Name": "running"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       StoppingInstances -> (list)
          Information about the stopped instances.

          (structure)
              Describes an instance state change.

              CurrentState -> (structure)
                 The current state of the instance.

                 Code -> (integer)
                     The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

                     The high  byte  is  all  of  the  bits  between  2^8  and
                     (2^16)-1,  which  equals  decimal  values between 256 and
                     65,535. These numerical values are used for internal pur-
                     poses and should be ignored.

                     The  low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1,
                     which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.

                     The valid values for instance-state-code will all  be  in
                     the range of the low byte and they are:

                     o 0 : pending

                     o 16 : running

                     o 32 : shutting-down

                     o 48 : terminated

                     o 64 : stopping

                     o 80 : stopped

                     You  can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of
                     the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The current state of the instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the instance.

              PreviousState -> (structure)
                 The previous state of the instance.

                 Code -> (integer)
                     The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

                     The high  byte  is  all  of  the  bits  between  2^8  and
                     (2^16)-1,  which  equals  decimal  values between 256 and
                     65,535. These numerical values are used for internal pur-
                     poses and should be ignored.

                     The  low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1,
                     which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.

                     The valid values for instance-state-code will all  be  in
                     the range of the low byte and they are:

                     o 0 : pending

                     o 16 : running

                     o 32 : shutting-down

                     o 48 : terminated

                     o 64 : stopping

                     o 80 : stopped

                     You  can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of
                     the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The current state of the instance.
