CANCEL-SPOT-FLEET-REQUESTS()                      CANCEL-SPOT-FLEET-REQUESTS()



NAME
       cancel-spot-fleet-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels the specified Spot Fleet requests.

       After  you  cancel a Spot Fleet request, the Spot Fleet launches no new
       instances.

       You must also specify whether a canceled Spot Fleet request should ter-
       minate  its  instances.  If  you choose to terminate the instances, the
       Spot Fleet request enters the cancelled_terminating  state.  Otherwise,
       the  Spot  Fleet request enters the cancelled_running state and the in-
       stances continue to run until they are  interrupted  or  you  terminate
       them manually.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --spot-fleet-request-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Spot Fleet requests.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --terminate-instances | --no-terminate-instances (boolean)
          Indicates whether to terminate the  associated  instances  when  the
          Spot  Fleet request is canceled. The default is to terminate the in-
          stances.

          To let the instances continue to run after the Spot Fleet request is
          canceled, specify no-terminate-instances .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To cancel Spot fleet requests

       This  example  command  cancels a Spot fleet request and terminates the
       associated Spot Instances.

       Command:

          aws ec2 cancel-spot-fleet-requests --spot-fleet-request-ids sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE --terminate-instances

       Output:

          {
            "SuccessfulFleetRequests": [
                {
                    "SpotFleetRequestId": "sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE",
                    "CurrentSpotFleetRequestState": "cancelled_running",
                    "PreviousSpotFleetRequestState": "active"

                    "PreviousSpotFleetRequestState": "active"

          (structure)
