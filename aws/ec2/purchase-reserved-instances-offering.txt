DESCRIPTION
       Purchases  a Reserved Instance for use with your account. With Reserved
       Instances, you pay a lower hourly rate compared to  On-Demand  instance
       pricing.

       Use   DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings  to get a list of Reserved In-
       stance offerings that match your specifications. After you've purchased
       a  Reserved Instance, you can check for your new Reserved Instance with
       DescribeReservedInstances .

       To queue a purchase for a future date  and  time,  specify  a  purchase
       time. If you do not specify a purchase time, the default is the current
       time.

       For more information, see Reserved Instances and Sell in  the  Reserved
       Instance Marketplace in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --instance-count (integer)
          The number of Reserved Instances to purchase.

       --reserved-instances-offering-id (string)
          The ID of the Reserved Instance offering to purchase.

       --purchase-time (timestamp)
          The  time  at which to purchase the Reserved Instance, in UTC format

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --limit-price (structure)
          Specified  for  Reserved Instance Marketplace offerings to limit the
          total order and ensure that the Reserved Instances are not purchased
          at unexpected prices.

          Amount -> (double)
              Used  for Reserved Instance Marketplace offerings. Specifies the
              limit price on the total order (instanceCount * price).

          CurrencyCode -> (string)
              The currency in which the limitPrice  amount  is  specified.  At
              this time, the only supported currency is USD .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Amount=double,CurrencyCode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Amount": double,
            "CurrencyCode": "USD"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          }

OUTPUT
       ReservedInstancesId -> (string)
          The  IDs  of  the  purchased  Reserved  Instances.  If your purchase
          crosses into a discounted pricing tier, the final Reserved Instances
