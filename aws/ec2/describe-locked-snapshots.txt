OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o lock-state  - The state of the snapshot lock (compliance-cooloff |
            governance | compliance | expired ).

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return for this request. To  get  the
          next  page of items, make another request with the token returned in
          the output. For more information, see Pagination .

       --next-token (string)
          The token returned from a  previous  paginated  request.  Pagination
          continues  from  the  end  of the items returned by the previous re-
          quest.

       --snapshot-ids (list)
          The IDs of the snapshots for which to view the lock status.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Snapshots -> (list)
          Information about the snapshots.

          (structure)
              Information about a locked snapshot.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The  account  ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns
                 the snapshot.

              LockState -> (string)
                 The state of the snapshot lock. Valid states include:

                 o compliance-cooloff - The snapshot has been locked  in  com-
                   pliance mode but it is still within the cooling-off period.
                   The snapshot can't be deleted, but it can be  unlocked  and
                   the lock settings can be modified by users with appropriate
                   permissions.

                 o governance - The snapshot is locked in governance mode. The
                   snapshot  can't  be deleted, but it can be unlocked and the
                   lock settings can be modified  by  users  with  appropriate
                   permissions.

                 o compliance  - The snapshot is locked in compliance mode and
                   the cooling-off period has expired. The snapshot  can't  be
                   unlocked  or  deleted.  The  lock  duration can only be in-
                   creased by users with appropriate permissions.

                 o expired - The snapshot was locked in compliance  or  gover-
                   nance  mode but the lock duration has expired. The snapshot
                   is not locked and can be deleted.

              LockDuration -> (integer)
                 The period of time for which the snapshot is locked, in days.

              CoolOffPeriod -> (integer)
                 The compliance mode cooling-off period, in hours.

              CoolOffPeriodExpiresOn -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the  compliance  mode  cooling-off
                 period      expires,     in     the     UTC     time     zone
                 (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ ).

              LockCreatedOn -> (timestamp)

              LockDurationStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time at which the lock duration started, in the
                 UTC time zone (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ ).

                 If you lock a snapshot that is in the pending state, the lock
                 duration  starts  only once the snapshot enters the completed
                 state.

              LockExpiresOn -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the lock will expire, in  the  UTC
                 time zone (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ ).

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to  include  in  another request to get the next page of
          items. This value is null when there are no more items to return.
