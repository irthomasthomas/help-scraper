NAME
       create-capacity-reservation-by-splitting -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  a  new  Capacity  Reservation  by splitting the capacity of the
       source Capacity Reservation. The new Capacity Reservation will have the
       same attributes as the source Capacity Reservation except for tags. The
       source Capacity Reservation must be active and owned by your Amazon Web
       Services account.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensure Idempo-
          tency .

       --source-capacity-reservation-id (string)
          The ID of the Capacity Reservation from which you want to split  the
          capacity.

       --instance-count (integer)
          The  number  of instances to split from the source Capacity Reserva-
          tion.

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to apply to the new Capacity Reservation.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type
              to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

              NOTE:
                 The Valid Values lists all the resource  types  that  can  be
                 tagged.  However,  the  action you're using might not support
                 tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a  re-
                 source  type that is unsupported for the action you're using,
                 you'll get an error.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              The Availability Zone in which the capacity is reserved.

          Tenancy -> (string)
              Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity  Reservation.  A  Capacity
              Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:

              o default - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that
                is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.

              o dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-ten-
                ant hardware that is dedicated to a single Amazon Web Services
                account.

          TotalInstanceCount -> (integer)

              vation can be in one of the following states:

              o active - The capacity is available for use.

              o expired - The Capacity Reservation  expired  automatically  at
                the  date  and time specified in your reservation request. The
                reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.

              o cancelled - The Capacity Reservation  was  canceled.  The  re-
                served capacity is no longer available for your use.

              o pending  - The Capacity Reservation request was successful but
                the capacity provisioning is still pending.

              o failed - The Capacity Reservation request has  failed.  A  re-
                quest  can  fail due to request parameters that are not valid,
                capacity constraints, or instance limit constraints.  You  can
                view a failed request for 60 minutes.

              o scheduled - (Future-dated Capacity Reservations only ) The fu-
                ture-dated Capacity Reservation request was approved  and  the
                Capacity  Reservation  is  scheduled  for  delivery on the re-
                quested start date.

              o assessing - (Future-dated Capacity Reservations only )  Amazon
                EC2  is  assessing  your  request  for a future-dated Capacity
                Reservation.

              o delayed - (Future-dated Capacity Reservations  only  )  Amazon
                EC2  encountered  a  delay  in  provisioning the requested fu-
                ture-dated Capacity Reservation. Amazon EC2 is unable  to  de-
                liver  the  requested capacity by the requested start date and
                time.

              o unsupported - (Future-dated Capacity Reservations only )  Ama-
                zon  EC2  can't  support the future-dated Capacity Reservation
                request due to capacity constraints. You can view  unsupported
                requests for 30 days. The Capacity Reservation will not be de-
                livered.

          StartDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was started.

          EndDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time at which  the  Capacity  Reservation  expires.
              When  a  Capacity  Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is
              released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Ca-
              pacity  Reservation's  state  changes to expired when it reaches
              its end date and time.

          EndDateType -> (string)
              Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A  Ca-
              pacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:

              o unlimited  - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you
                explicitly cancel it.

              o limited - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at  a
                specified date and time.

          InstanceMatchCriteria -> (string)
              Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reser-
              vation accepts. The options include:

              o open - The Capacity Reservation  accepts  all  instances  that
                have  matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Avail-
                ability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes  launch
                into the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying
                any additional parameters.

              o targeted - The Capacity  Reservation  only  accepts  instances
                that  have  matching  attributes (instance type, platform, and
                Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity  Reser-
                vation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the
                reserved capacity.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was created.

              The total number of instances for which the Capacity Reservation
              reserves capacity.

          AvailableInstanceCount -> (integer)
              The remaining capacity. Indicates the number of  instances  that
              can be launched in the Capacity Reservation.

          EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  the  Capacity Reservation supports EBS-opti-
              mized instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput
              to  Amazon  EBS  and an optimized configuration stack to provide
              optimal I/O performance. This optimization isn't available  with
              all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an
              EBS- optimized instance.

          EphemeralStorage -> (boolean)
              Deprecated.

          State -> (string)
              The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reser-
              vation can be in one of the following states:

              o active - The capacity is available for use.

              o expired  -  The  Capacity Reservation expired automatically at
                the date and time specified in your reservation  request.  The
                reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.

              o cancelled  -  The  Capacity  Reservation was canceled. The re-
                served capacity is no longer available for your use.

              o pending - The Capacity Reservation request was successful  but
                the capacity provisioning is still pending.

              o failed  -  The  Capacity Reservation request has failed. A re-
                quest can fail due to request parameters that are  not  valid,
                capacity  constraints,  or instance limit constraints. You can
                view a failed request for 60 minutes.

              o scheduled - (Future-dated Capacity Reservations only ) The fu-
                ture-dated  Capacity  Reservation request was approved and the
                Capacity Reservation is scheduled  for  delivery  on  the  re-
                quested start date.

              o assessing  - (Future-dated Capacity Reservations only ) Amazon
                EC2 is assessing your  request  for  a  future-dated  Capacity
                Reservation.

              o delayed  -  (Future-dated  Capacity Reservations only ) Amazon
                EC2 encountered a delay  in  provisioning  the  requested  fu-
                ture-dated  Capacity  Reservation. Amazon EC2 is unable to de-
                liver the requested capacity by the requested start  date  and
                time.

              o unsupported  - (Future-dated Capacity Reservations only ) Ama-
                zon EC2 can't support the  future-dated  Capacity  Reservation
                request  due to capacity constraints. You can view unsupported
                requests for 30 days. The Capacity Reservation will not be de-
                livered.

          StartDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was started.

          EndDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time  at which the Capacity Reservation expires.
              When a Capacity Reservation expires, the  reserved  capacity  is
              released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Ca-
              pacity Reservation's state changes to expired  when  it  reaches
              its end date and time.

          EndDateType -> (string)
              Indicates  the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Ca-
              pacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:

              o unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains active until  you
                explicitly cancel it.

              o limited  - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a
                specified date and time.

          InstanceMatchCriteria -> (string)
              Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reser-
              vation accepts. The options include:

              o open  -  The  Capacity  Reservation accepts all instances that
                have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and  Avail-
                ability  Zone). Instances that have matching attributes launch
                into the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying
                any additional parameters.

              o targeted  -  The  Capacity  Reservation only accepts instances
                that have matching attributes (instance  type,  platform,  and
                Availability  Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reser-
                vation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the
                reserved capacity.
