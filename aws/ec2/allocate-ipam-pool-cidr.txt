ALLOCATE-IPAM-POOL-CIDR()                            ALLOCATE-IPAM-POOL-CIDR()



NAME
       allocate-ipam-pool-cidr -

DESCRIPTION
       Allocate  a  CIDR  from  an IPAM pool. The Region you use should be the
       IPAM pool locale. The locale is the Amazon Web  Services  Region  where
       this IPAM pool is available for allocations.

       In  IPAM,  an  allocation is a CIDR assignment from an IPAM pool to an-
       other IPAM pool or to a resource. For more  information,  see  Allocate
       CIDRs in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This  action  creates an allocation with strong consistency. The re-
          turned CIDR will not overlap with any  other  allocations  from  the
          same pool.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM pool from which you  would  like  to  allocate  a
          CIDR.

       --cidr (string)
          The  CIDR  you  would  like to allocate from the IPAM pool. Note the
          following:

          o If there is no DefaultNetmaskLength allocation  rule  set  on  the
            pool, you must specify either the NetmaskLength or the CIDR.

          o If  the  DefaultNetmaskLength  allocation rule is set on the pool,
            you can specify either the NetmaskLength or the CIDR and  the  De-
            faultNetmaskLength allocation rule will be ignored.

          Possible values: Any available IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR.

       --netmask-length (integer)
          The  netmask  length of the CIDR you would like to allocate from the
          IPAM pool. Note the following:

          o If there is no DefaultNetmaskLength allocation  rule  set  on  the
            pool, you must specify either the NetmaskLength or the CIDR.

          o If  the  DefaultNetmaskLength  allocation rule is set on the pool,
            you can specify either the NetmaskLength or the CIDR and  the  De-
            faultNetmaskLength allocation rule will be ignored.

          Possible  netmask  lengths  for  IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible
          netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensuring Idem-
          potency .

       --description (string)
          A description for the allocation.

       --preview-next-cidr | --no-preview-next-cidr (boolean)
          A preview of the next available CIDR in a pool.

       --disallowed-cidrs (list)
          Exclude a particular CIDR range from being  returned  by  the  pool.
          Disallowed  CIDRs are only allowed if using netmask length for allo-
          cation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To allocate a CIDR from an IPAM pool

       The following allocate-ipam-pool-cidr example allocates a CIDR from  an
       IPAM pool.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 allocate-ipam-pool-cidr \
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0533048da7d823723 \
              --netmask-length 24

       (Windows):

          aws ec2 allocate-ipam-pool-cidr ^
             --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0533048da7d823723 ^
             --netmask-length 24

       Output:

          {
              "IpamPoolAllocation": {
                  "Cidr": "10.0.0.0/24",
                  "IpamPoolAllocationId": "ipam-pool-alloc-018ecc28043b54ba38e2cd99943cebfbd",
                  "ResourceType": "custom",
                  "ResourceOwner": "123456789012"
              }
          }
