OPTIONS
       --image-id (string)
          The ID of the AMI.

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket in which the  AMI  object  will  be
          stored. The bucket must be in the Region in which the request is be-
          ing made. The AMI object appears in the bucket only after the upload
          task has completed.

       --s3-object-tags (list)
          The  tags to apply to the AMI object that will be stored in the Ama-
          zon S3 bucket.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to the AMI object that will be stored  in  the
              Amazon  S3  bucket.  For more information, see Categorizing your
              storage using tags in the Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  User
              Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and can be up to 128
                 Unicode characters in length. May not begin with aws :.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and can be  up  to
                 256 Unicode characters in length.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To store an AMI in an S3 bucket

       The following create-store-image-task example stores an AMI  in  an  S3
       bucket.  Specify  the  ID  of  the AMI and the name of the S3 bucket in
       which to store the AMI.

          aws ec2 create-store-image-task \
            --image-id ami-1234567890abcdef0 \
            --bucket my-ami-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "ObjectKey": "ami-1234567890abcdef0.bin"
          }

       For more information about storing and restoring an AMI using  S3,  see
       Store    and   restore   an   AMI   using   S3   <https://docs.aws.ama-
       zon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-store-restore.html> in  the  Amazon
       EC2 User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ObjectKey -> (string)
          The name of the stored AMI object in the S3 bucket.
