CREATE-VPC-ENDPOINT-CONNECTION-NOCREATE-VPC-ENDPOINT-CONNECTION-NOTIFICATION()



NAME
       create-vpc-endpoint-connection-notification -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  connection notification for a specified VPC endpoint or VPC
       endpoint service. A connection notification notifies  you  of  specific
       endpoint events. You must create an SNS topic to receive notifications.
       For more information, see Create a Topic in the Amazon Simple Notifica-
       tion Service Developer Guide .

       You can create a connection notification for interface endpoints only.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --service-id (string)
          The ID of the endpoint service.

       --vpc-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the endpoint.

       --connection-notification-arn (string)
          The ARN of the SNS topic for the notifications.

       --connection-events (list)
          One or more endpoint events  for  which  to  receive  notifications.
          Valid values are Accept , Connect , Delete , and Reject .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see How to  ensure
          idempotency .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an endpoint connection notification

       This  example  creates  a  notification for a specific endpoint service
       that alerts you when interface endpoints have connected to your service
       and when endpoints have been accepted for your service.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint-connection-notification --connection-notification-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:VpceNotification --connection-events Connect Accept --service-id vpce-svc-1237881c0d25a3abc

       Output:

          {
             "ConnectionNotification": {
                 "ConnectionNotificationState": "Enabled",
                 "ConnectionNotificationType": "Topic",
                 "ServiceId": "vpce-svc-1237881c0d25a3abc",
                 "ConnectionEvents": [
                     "Accept",
                     "Connect"
                 ],
                 "ConnectionNotificationId": "vpce-nfn-008776de7e03f5abc",
                 "ConnectionNotificationArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:VpceNotification"
             }
           }
