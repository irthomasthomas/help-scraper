DISASSOCIATE-VPC-CIDR-BLOCK()                    DISASSOCIATE-VPC-CIDR-BLOCK()



NAME
       disassociate-vpc-cidr-block -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  a CIDR block from a VPC. To disassociate the CIDR block,
       you must specify its association ID. You can get the association ID  by
       using   DescribeVpcs  .  You must detach or delete all gateways and re-
       sources that are associated with the CIDR block before you can disasso-
       ciate it.

       You  cannot  disassociate the CIDR block with which you originally cre-
       ated the VPC (the primary CIDR block).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-vpc-cidr-block
          --association-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-id (string)
          The association ID for the CIDR block.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disassociate an IPv6 CIDR block from a VPC

       This example disassociates an IPv6 CIDR block from a VPC using the  as-
       sociation ID for the CIDR block.

       Command:

          aws ec2 disassociate-vpc-cidr-block --association-id vpc-cidr-assoc-eca54085

       Output:

          {
            "Ipv6CidrBlockAssociation": {
                "Ipv6CidrBlock": "2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56",
                "AssociationId": "vpc-cidr-assoc-eca54085",
                "Ipv6CidrBlockState": {
                    "State": "disassociating"

            },
            "VpcId": "vpc-a034d6c4"
          }

       To disassociate an IPv4 CIDR block from a VPC

       This example disassociates an IPv4 CIDR block from a VPC.

       Command:

          aws ec2 disassociate-vpc-cidr-block --association-id vpc-cidr-assoc-0287ac6b

       Output:

          {
            "CidrBlockAssociation": {

                "CidrBlock": "172.18.0.0/16",
                "CidrBlockState": {
                    "State": "disassociating"
                }
            },
            "VpcId": "vpc-27621243"
          }
