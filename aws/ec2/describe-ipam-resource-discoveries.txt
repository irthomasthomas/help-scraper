NAME
       describe-ipam-resource-discoveries -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  IPAM  resource  discoveries. A resource discovery is an IPAM
       component that enables IPAM to manage and monitor resources that belong
       to the owning account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-ipam-resource-discoveries  is  a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: IpamResourceDiscoveries

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-resource-discovery-ids (list)
          The IPAM resource discovery IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          The resource discovery filters.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: View complete details of resource discoveries

       In  this example, you're a delegated IPAM admin who wants to create and
       share a resource discovery with the IPAM admin in another AWS Organiza-
       tion  so  that the admin can manage and monitor the IP addresses of re-
       sources in your organization.

       This example may be useful if:

       o You tried to create a resource discovery, but you got an  error  that
         you've reached your limit of 1. You realize that you may have already
         created a resource discovery and you want to view it in your account.

       o You have resources in a Region that are not being discovered  by  the
         IPAM.  You  want  to view the --operating-regions defined for the re-
         source and ensure that you've added the right Region as an  operating
         Region so that the resources there can be discovered.

       The  following describe-ipam-resource-discoveries example lists the de-
       tails of the resource discovery in your AWS account. You can  have  one
       resource discovery per AWS Region.

          aws ec2 describe-ipam-resource-discoveries \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "IpamResourceDiscoveries": [
                  {
                      "OwnerId": "149977607591",
                      "IpamResourceDiscoveryId": "ipam-res-disco-0f8bdee9067137c0d",
                      "IpamResourceDiscoveryArn": "arn:aws:ec2::149977607591:ipam-resource-discovery/ipam-res-disco-0f8bdee9067137c0d",
                      "IpamResourceDiscoveryRegion": "us-east-1",
                      "OperatingRegions": [
                          {
                              "RegionName": "us-east-1"
                          }
                      ],
                      "IsDefault": false,
                      "State": "create-complete",
                      "Tags": []
              }
          ]
          }

       organization in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide.

       Example 2: View only resource discovery IDs

       The following describe-ipam-resource-discoveries example lists  the  ID
       of  the  resource  discovery  in your AWS account. You can have one re-
       source discovery per AWS Region.

          aws ec2 describe-ipam-resource-discoveries \
              --query "IpamResourceDiscoveries[*].IpamResourceDiscoveryId" \
              --output text

       Output:

          ipam-res-disco-0481e39b242860333

              OperatingRegions -> (list)
                 The operating Regions for the resource  discovery.  Operating
                 Regions are Amazon Web Services Regions where the IPAM is al-
                 lowed to manage IP address CIDRs.  IPAM  only  discovers  and
                 monitors resources in the Amazon Web Services Regions you se-
                 lect as operating Regions.

                 (structure)
                     The operating Regions for an IPAM. Operating Regions  are
                     Amazon  Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to
                     manage IP address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors
                     resources  in  the Amazon Web Services Regions you select
                     as operating Regions.

                     For more information about operating Regions, see  Create
                     an IPAM in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

                 Defines if the resource discovery is the default. The default
                 resource discovery is the  resource  discovery  automatically
                 created when you create an IPAM.

              State -> (string)
                 The lifecycle state of the resource discovery.

                 o create-failed - Resource discovery creation has failed.

                 o modify-in-progress - Resource discovery is being modified.

                 o modify-complete  -  Resource discovery modification is com-
                   plete.

                 o modify-failed - Resource discovery modification has failed.

                 o delete-in-progress - Resource discovery is being deleted.

                 o delete-complete - Resource discovery deletion is complete.

                 o delete-failed - Resource discovery deletion has failed.

                 o isolate-in-progress - Amazon Web Services account that cre-
                   ated  the  resource  discovery has been removed and the re-
                   source discovery is being isolated.

                 o isolate-complete - Resource  discovery  isolation  is  com-
                   plete.

                 o restore-in-progress - Amazon Web Services account that cre-
                   ated the resource discovery and was isolated has  been  re-
                   stored.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A  tag  is  a label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services
                 resource. Each tag consists of a key and an  optional  value.
                 You can use tags to search and filter your resources or track
                 your Amazon Web Services costs.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Specify the pagination token from a previous request to retrieve the
          next page of results.
