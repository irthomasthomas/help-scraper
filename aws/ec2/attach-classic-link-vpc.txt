ATTACH-CLASSIC-LINK-VPC()                            ATTACH-CLASSIC-LINK-VPC()



NAME
       attach-classic-link-vpc -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          We  are  retiring  EC2-Classic on August 15, 2022. We recommend that
          you migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC.  For  more  information,  see
          Migrate  from  EC2-Classic  to  a  VPC in the Amazon Elastic Compute
          Cloud User Guide .

       Links an EC2-Classic instance to a ClassicLink-enabled VPC through  one
       or  more  of  the VPC's security groups. You cannot link an EC2-Classic
       instance to more than one VPC at a time. You can only link an  instance
       that's in the running state. An instance is automatically unlinked from
       a VPC when it's stopped - you can link it to the  VPC  again  when  you
       restart it.

       After  you've  linked  an  instance, you cannot change the VPC security
       groups that are associated with it. To change the security groups,  you
       must first unlink the instance, and then link it again.

       Linking  your  instance  to a VPC is sometimes referred to as attaching
       your instance.

SYNOPSIS
            attach-classic-link-vpc
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --groups <value>
          --instance-id <value>
          --vpc-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --groups (list)
          The ID of one or more of the VPC's security groups. You cannot spec-
          ify security groups from a different VPC.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of an EC2-Classic instance to link to the ClassicLink-enabled
          VPC.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of a ClassicLink-enabled VPC.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To link (attach) an EC2-Classic instance to a VPC

       This  example  links  instance  i-1234567890abcdef0 to VPC vpc-88888888
       through the VPC security group sg-12312312.

       Command:

          aws ec2 attach-classic-link-vpc --instance-id  i-1234567890abcdef0 --vpc-id vpc-88888888 --groups sg-12312312

       Output:

          {
            "Return": true
          }

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns true if the request succeeds; otherwise, it returns  an  er-
          ror.
