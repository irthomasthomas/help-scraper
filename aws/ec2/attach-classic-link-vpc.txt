ATTACH-CLASSIC-LINK-VPC()                            ATTACH-CLASSIC-LINK-VPC()



NAME
       attach-classic-link-vpc -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This action is deprecated.

       Links  an EC2-Classic instance to a ClassicLink-enabled VPC through one
       or more of the VPC security groups. You cannot link an EC2-Classic  in-
       stance  to  more  than one VPC at a time. You can only link an instance
       that's in the running state. An instance is automatically unlinked from
       a  VPC  when  it's  stopped - you can link it to the VPC again when you
       restart it.

       After you've linked an instance, you cannot  change  the  VPC  security
       groups  that are associated with it. To change the security groups, you
       must first unlink the instance, and then link it again.

       Linking your instance to a VPC is sometimes referred  to  as  attaching
       your instance.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --groups (list)
          The IDs of the security groups. You cannot specify  security  groups
          from a different VPC.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the EC2-Classic instance.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the ClassicLink-enabled VPC.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To link (attach) an EC2-Classic instance to a VPC

       This example links instance  i-1234567890abcdef0  to  VPC  vpc-88888888
       through the VPC security group sg-12312312.

       Command:

          aws ec2 attach-classic-link-vpc --instance-id  i-1234567890abcdef0 --vpc-id vpc-88888888 --groups sg-12312312

       Output:

          {
            "Return": true
          }

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns  true  if the request succeeds; otherwise, it returns an er-
          ror.
