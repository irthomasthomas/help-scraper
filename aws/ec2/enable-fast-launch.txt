ENABLE-FAST-LAUNCH()                                      ENABLE-FAST-LAUNCH()



NAME
       enable-fast-launch -

DESCRIPTION
       When  you  enable  Windows  fast  launch  for a Windows AMI, images are
       pre-provisioned, using snapshots to launch instances up to 65%  faster.
       To  create the optimized Windows image, Amazon EC2 launches an instance
       and runs through Sysprep steps, rebooting as required. Then it  creates
       a  set of reserved snapshots that are used for subsequent launches. The
       reserved snapshots are automatically replenished as they are used,  de-
       pending on your settings for launch frequency.

       NOTE:
          You  can only change these settings for Windows AMIs that you own or
          that have been shared with you.

OPTIONS
       --image-id (string)
          Specify the ID of the image for which to enable Windows fast launch.

       --resource-type (string)
          The type of resource to use for pre-provisioning the AMI for Windows
          fast  launch.  Supported values include: snapshot , which is the de-
          fault value.

       --snapshot-configuration (structure)
          Configuration settings for creating and managing the snapshots  that
          are  used  for pre-provisioning the AMI for Windows fast launch. The
          associated ResourceType must be snapshot .

          TargetResourceCount -> (integer)
              The number of pre-provisioned snapshots to keep on  hand  for  a
              Windows fast launch enabled AMI.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TargetResourceCount=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TargetResourceCount": integer
          }

       --launch-template (structure)
          The  launch  template  to  use when launching Windows instances from
          pre-provisioned snapshots. Launch template  parameters  can  include
          either the name or ID of the launch template, but not both.

          LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
              Specify  the  ID  of the launch template that the AMI should use
              for Windows fast launch.

          LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
              Specify the name of the launch template that the AMI should  use
              for Windows fast launch.

          Version -> (string)
              Specify  the  version of the launch template that the AMI should
              use for Windows fast launch.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LaunchTemplateId=string,LaunchTemplateName=string,Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LaunchTemplateId": "string",
            "LaunchTemplateName": "string",
            "Version": "string"
          }

       --max-parallel-launches (integer)
          The maximum number of instances that Amazon EC2 can  launch  at  the
          same  time  to  create  pre-provisioned  snapshots  for Windows fast
          launch. Value must be 6 or greater.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start fast launching for an image

       The following enable-fast-launch example starts fast launching  on  the
       specified  AMI  and  sets  the  maximum number of parallel instances to
       launch to 6. The type of resource to use to pre-provision  the  AMI  is
       set to snapshot, which is also the default value.

          aws ec2 enable-fast-launch \
              --image-id ami-01234567890abcedf \
              --max-parallel-launches 6 \
              --resource-type snapshot

       Output:

          {
              "ImageId": "ami-01234567890abcedf",
              "ResourceType": "snapshot",
              "SnapshotConfiguration": {
                  "TargetResourceCount": 10
              },
              "LaunchTemplate": {},
              "MaxParallelLaunches": 6,
              "OwnerId": "0123456789123",
              "State": "enabling",
              "StateTransitionReason": "Client.UserInitiated",
              "StateTransitionTime": "2022-01-27T22:16:03.199000+00:00"
          }
