ENABLE-FAST-LAUNCH()                                      ENABLE-FAST-LAUNCH()



NAME
       enable-fast-launch -

DESCRIPTION
       When you enable faster launching for a Windows AMI, images are pre-pro-
       visioned, using snapshots to launch instances up to 65% faster. To cre-
       ate  the  optimized  Windows image, Amazon EC2 launches an instance and
       runs through Sysprep steps, rebooting as required. Then  it  creates  a
       set  of  reserved  snapshots that are used for subsequent launches. The
       reserved snapshots are automatically replenished as they are used,  de-
       pending on your settings for launch frequency.

       NOTE:
          To change these settings, you must own the AMI.

       --resource-type (string)
          The type of resource to use for pre-provisioning the Windows AMI for
          faster launching. Supported values include: snapshot , which is  the
          default value.

       --snapshot-configuration (structure)
          Configuration  settings for creating and managing the snapshots that
          are used for pre-provisioning the Windows AMI for faster  launching.
          The associated ResourceType must be snapshot .

          TargetResourceCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  pre-provisioned snapshots to keep on hand for a
              fast-launch enabled Windows AMI.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TargetResourceCount=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TargetResourceCount": integer
          }

       --launch-template (structure)
          The launch template to use when  launching  Windows  instances  from
          pre-provisioned  snapshots.  Launch  template parameters can include
          either the name or ID of the launch template, but not both.

          LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
              The ID of the launch template to use for faster launching for  a
              Windows AMI.

          LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
              The  name of the launch template to use for faster launching for
              a Windows AMI.

          Version -> (string)
              The version of the launch template to use for  faster  launching
              for a Windows AMI.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LaunchTemplateId=string,LaunchTemplateName=string,Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LaunchTemplateId": "string",
            "LaunchTemplateName": "string",
            "Version": "string"
          }

       --max-parallel-launches (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of instances that Amazon EC2 can launch at the
          same time to create pre-provisioned  snapshots  for  Windows  faster
          launching. Value must be 6 or greater.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start fast launching for an image

       The following enable-fast-launch example starts fast launching  on  the
       specified  AMI  and  sets  the  maximum number of parallel instances to
       launch to 6. The type of resource to use to pre-provision  the  AMI  is
       set to snapshot, which is also the default value.

          aws ec2 enable-fast-launch \
              --image-id ami-01234567890abcedf \
              --max-parallel-launches 6 \
              --resource-type snapshot

       Output:

          {
              "ImageId": "ami-01234567890abcedf",
              "ResourceType": "snapshot",
              "SnapshotConfiguration": {
                  "TargetResourceCount": 10
              },
              "LaunchTemplate": {},
              "MaxParallelLaunches": 6,
              "OwnerId": "0123456789123",
              "State": "enabling",
              "StateTransitionReason": "Client.UserInitiated",
              "StateTransitionTime": "2022-01-27T22:16:03.199000+00:00"
          }
