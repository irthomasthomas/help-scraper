NAME
       modify-transit-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the specified transit gateway. When you modify a transit gate-
       way, the modified options are applied to new  transit  gateway  attach-
       ments only. Your existing transit gateway attachments are not modified.

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway.

       --description (string)
          The description for the transit gateway.

       --options (structure)
          The options to modify.

          AddTransitGatewayCidrBlocks -> (list)
              Adds IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR blocks for the transit gateway. Must be a
              size /24 CIDR block or larger for IPv4, or a size /64 CIDR block
              or larger for IPv6.

              (string)

          RemoveTransitGatewayCidrBlocks -> (list)
              Removes CIDR blocks for the transit gateway.

              (string)

          VpnEcmpSupport -> (string)
              Enable or disable Equal Cost Multipath Protocol support.

          DnsSupport -> (string)
              Enable or disable DNS support.

          SecurityGroupReferencingSupport -> (string)

              NOTE:
                 This  parameter  is  in  preview and may not be available for
                 your account.

              Enables you to reference a security group across  VPCs  attached
              to a transit gateway. Use this option to simplify security group
              management and control of  instance-to-instance  traffic  across
              VPCs  that  are  connected  by transit gateway. You can also use
              this option to migrate from VPC peering (which was the only  op-
              tion that supported security group referencing) to transit gate-
              ways (which now also support security group  referencing).  This
              option  is disabled by default and there are no additional costs
              to use this feature.

          AutoAcceptSharedAttachments -> (string)
              Enable or disable automatic acceptance of attachment requests.

          DefaultRouteTableAssociation -> (string)
              Enable or disable automatic association with the default associ-
              ation route table.

          AssociationDefaultRouteTableId -> (string)
              The ID of the default association route table.

          DefaultRouteTablePropagation -> (string)
              Enable or disable automatic propagation of routes to the default
              propagation route table.

          PropagationDefaultRouteTableId -> (string)
              The ID of the default propagation route table.

          AmazonSideAsn -> (long)
              A private Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the Amazon side  of
              a  BGP  session. The range is 64512 to 65534 for 16-bit ASNs and
              4200000000 to 4294967294 for 32-bit ASNs.

              The modify ASN operation is not allowed on a transit gateway  if
              it has the following attachments:

              o Dynamic VPN

              o Static VPN

              o Direct Connect Gateway

              o Connect

              You must first delete all transit gateway attachments configured
              prior to modifying the ASN on the transit gateway.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AddTransitGatewayCidrBlocks": ["string", ...],
            "RemoveTransitGatewayCidrBlocks": ["string", ...],
            "VpnEcmpSupport": "enable"|"disable",
            "DnsSupport": "enable"|"disable",
            "SecurityGroupReferencingSupport": "enable"|"disable",
            "AutoAcceptSharedAttachments": "enable"|"disable",

            "PropagationDefaultRouteTableId": "string",
            "AmazonSideAsn": long
          }

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
