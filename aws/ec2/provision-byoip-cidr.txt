PROVISION-BYOIP-CIDR()                                  PROVISION-BYOIP-CIDR()



NAME
       provision-byoip-cidr -

DESCRIPTION
       Provisions  an  IPv4 or IPv6 address range for use with your Amazon Web
       Services resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) and cre-
       ates  a  corresponding  address pool. After the address range is provi-
       sioned, it is ready to be advertised using  AdvertiseByoipCidr .

       Amazon Web Services verifies that you own the address range and are au-
       thorized  to  advertise  it.  You must ensure that the address range is
       registered to you and that you created an RPKI ROA to authorize  Amazon
       ASNs  16509 and 14618 to advertise the address range. For more informa-
       tion, see Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in the  Amazon  EC2  User
       Guide .

       Provisioning an address range is an asynchronous operation, so the call
       returns immediately, but the address range is not ready  to  use  until
       its  status  changes from pending-provision to provisioned . To monitor
       the status of an address range, use  DescribeByoipCidrs .  To  allocate
       an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address pool, use  AllocateAddress
       with either the specific address from the address pool or the ID of the
       address pool.

OPTIONS
       --cidr (string)
          The  public  IPv4  or IPv6 address range, in CIDR notation. The most
          specific IPv4 prefix that you can specify is /24. The most  specific
          IPv6 address range that you can bring is /48 for CIDRs that are pub-
          licly advertisable and /56 for CIDRs that are not publicly advertis-
          able.  The  address  range cannot overlap with another address range
          that you've brought to this or another Region.

       --cidr-authorization-context (structure)
          A signed document that proves that you are authorized to  bring  the
          specified IP address range to Amazon using BYOIP.

          Message -> (string)
              The plain-text authorization message for the prefix and account.

          Signature -> (string)
              The signed authorization message for the prefix and account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Message=string,Signature=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Message": "string",
            "Signature": "string"
          }

       --publicly-advertisable | --no-publicly-advertisable (boolean)
          (IPv6  only) Indicate whether the address range will be publicly ad-
          vertised to the internet.

          Default: true

       --description (string)
          A description for the address range and the address pool.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --pool-tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to apply to the address pool.

          (structure)
              The  tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being cre-
              ated. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type
              to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

              NOTE:
                 The  Valid  Values  lists  all the resource types that can be
                 tagged. However, the action you're using  might  not  support
                 tagging  all of these resource types. If you try to tag a re-
                 source type that is unsupported for the action you're  using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,Tags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --multi-region | --no-multi-region (boolean)
          Reserved.

       --network-border-group (string)
          If you have Local Zones enabled, you can  choose  a  network  border
          group  for  Local  Zones  when you provision and advertise a BYOIPv4
          CIDR. Choose the network border group carefully as the EIP  and  the
          Amazon  Web  Services  resource it is associated with must reside in
          the same network border group.

          You can provision BYOIP address ranges to and advertise them in  the
          following Local Zone network border groups:

          o us-east-1-dfw-2

          o us-west-2-lax-1

          o us-west-2-phx-2

          NOTE:
              You  cannot provision or advertise BYOIPv6 address ranges in Lo-
              cal Zones at this time.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To provision an address range

       The following provision-byoip-cidr example provisions a public  IP  ad-
       dress range for use with AWS.

          aws ec2 provision-byoip-cidr \
              --cidr 203.0.113.25/24 \
              --cidr-authorization-context Message="$text_message",Signature="$signed_message"

       Output:

          {
              "ByoipCidr": {
                  "Cidr": "203.0.113.25/24",
                  "State": "pending-provision"
              }
          }

       For more information about creating the messages strings for the autho-
       rization context, see Bring Your Own IP Addresses  in  the  Amazon  EC2
       User Guide.
