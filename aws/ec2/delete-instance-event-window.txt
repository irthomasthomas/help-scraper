SYNOPSIS
            delete-instance-event-window
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--force-delete | --no-force-delete]
          --instance-event-window-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --force-delete | --no-force-delete (boolean)
          Specify  true to force delete the event window. Use the force delete
          parameter if the event window is currently associated with targets.

       --instance-event-window-id (string)
          The ID of the event window.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To delete an event window

       The following delete-instance-event-window  example  deletes  an  event
       window.

          aws ec2 delete-instance-event-window \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --instance-event-window-id iew-0abcdef1234567890

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceEventWindowState": {
                  "InstanceEventWindowId": "iew-0abcdef1234567890",
                  "State": "deleting"
              }
          }

       For  event  window  constraints,  see  Considerations  in the Scheduled
       Events section of the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 2: To force delete an event window

       The following delete-instance-event-window  example  force  deletes  an
       event window if the event window is currently associated with targets.

          aws ec2 delete-instance-event-window \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --instance-event-window-id iew-0abcdef1234567890 \
              --force-delete

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceEventWindowState": {
                  "InstanceEventWindowId": "iew-0abcdef1234567890",
                  "State": "deleting"
              }
          }

       For  event  window  constraints,  see  Considerations  in the Scheduled
       Events section of the Amazon EC2 User Guide.
