NAME
       modify-default-credit-specification -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  default credit option for CPU usage of burstable perfor-
       mance instances. The default credit option is set at the account  level
       per  Amazon  Web Services Region, and is specified per instance family.
       All new burstable performance instances in the account launch using the
       default credit option.
          ModifyDefaultCreditSpecification is an asynchronous operation, which
          works at an Amazon Web Services Region level and modifies the credit
          option for each Availability Zone. All zones in a Region are updated
          within five minutes. But if instances are launched during this oper-
          ation,  they  might  not get the new credit option until the zone is
          updated. To verify whether the update has  occurred,  you  can  call
          GetDefaultCreditSpecification  and  check DefaultCreditSpecification
          for updates.

       For more information, see Burstable performance instances in the Amazon
       EC2 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-family (string)
          The instance family.

          Possible values:

          o t2

          o t3

          o t3a

          o t4g

       --cpu-credits (string)
          The credit option for CPU usage of the instance family.

          Valid Values: standard | unlimited

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify the default credit option

       The  following modify-default-credit-specification example modifies the
       default credit option for T2 instances.

          aws ec2 modify-default-credit-specification \
              --instance-family t2 \
              --cpu-credits unlimited

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceFamilyCreditSpecification": {
                  "InstanceFamily": "t2",
                  "CpuCredits": "unlimited"
              }
          }

       InstanceFamilyCreditSpecification -> (structure)
          The default credit option for CPU usage of the instance family.

              The instance family.

          CpuCredits -> (string)
              The default credit option for CPU usage of the instance  family.
              Valid values are standard and unlimited .
