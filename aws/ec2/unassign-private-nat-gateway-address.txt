UNASSIGN-PRIVATE-NAT-GATEWAY-ADDRESS()  UNASSIGN-PRIVATE-NAT-GATEWAY-ADDRESS()



NAME
       unassign-private-nat-gateway-address -

DESCRIPTION
       Unassigns  secondary private IPv4 addresses from a private NAT gateway.
       You cannot unassign your primary private IP. For more information,  see
       Edit secondary IP address associations in the Amazon VPC User Guide .

       While unassigning is in progress, you cannot assign/unassign additional
       IP addresses while the connections are being drained. You are, however,
       allowed to delete the NAT gateway.

       A  private IP address will only be released at the end of MaxDrainDura-
       tionSeconds. The private IP addresses stay associated and  support  the
       existing  connections, but do not support any new connections (new con-
       nections are distributed across the remaining assigned private  IP  ad-
       dress).  After  the  existing connections drain out, the private IP ad-
       dresses are released.

OPTIONS
       --nat-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the NAT gateway.

       --private-ip-addresses (list)
          The private IPv4 addresses you want to unassign.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --max-drain-duration-seconds (integer)
          The maximum amount of time to wait (in seconds) before forcibly  re-
          leasing  the  IP addresses if connections are still in progress. De-
          fault value is 350 seconds.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
