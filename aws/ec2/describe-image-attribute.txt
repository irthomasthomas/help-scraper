OPTIONS
       --attribute (string)
          The AMI attribute.
              Note : The blockDeviceMapping  attribute  is  deprecated.  Using
              this  attribute returns the Client.AuthFailure error. To get in-
              formation about the block device mappings for an  AMI,  use  the
              DescribeImages action.

          Possible values:

          o description

          o kernel

          o ramdisk

          o launchPermission

          o productCodes

          o blockDeviceMapping

          o sriovNetSupport

          o bootMode

          o tpmSupport

          o uefiData

          o lastLaunchedTime

          o imdsSupport

       --image-id (string)
          The ID of the AMI.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe the launch permissions for an AMI

       This example describes the launch permissions for the specified AMI.

       Command:

          aws ec2 describe-image-attribute --image-id ami-5731123e --attribute launchPermission

       Output:

          {
              "LaunchPermissions": [
                  {
                      "UserId": "123456789012"
                  }
              ],
              "ImageId": "ami-5731123e",
          }

       To describe the product codes for an AMI

       This example describes the product codes for the  specified  AMI.  Note
       that this AMI has no product codes.

       Command:

          aws ec2 describe-image-attribute --image-id ami-5731123e --attribute productCodes

       Output:

          {
              "ProductCodes": [],
              "ImageId": "ami-5731123e",
          }

OUTPUT
       BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)
          The block device mapping entries.

          (structure)
              Describes  a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes
              and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch.

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

              VirtualName -> (string)
                 The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes
                 are  numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 avail-
                 able  instance  store  volumes  can  specify   mappings   for
                 ephemeral0  and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance
                 store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect
                 to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                 NVMe  instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and
                 assigned a device name. Including them in your  block  device
                 mapping has no effect.

                 Constraints:  For  M3  instances,  you  must specify instance
                 store volumes in the block device mapping for  the  instance.
                 When  you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store
                 volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

              Ebs -> (structure)
                 Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when  the
                 instance is launched.

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the EBS volume is deleted on instance
                     termination. For more information, see Preserving  Amazon
                     EBS  volumes  on  instance  termination in the Amazon EC2
                     User Guide .

                 Iops -> (integer)
                     The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 ,
                     io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS
                     that are provisioned for the  volume.  For  gp2  volumes,
                     this  represents  the  baseline performance of the volume
                     and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O  credits
                     for bursting.

                     The  following  are  the supported values for each volume
                     type:

                     o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                     o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee  64,000  IOPS  only
                     for  Instances built on the Nitro System . Other instance
                     families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                     This parameter is required for io1 and io2  volumes.  The
                     default  for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is
                     not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                 SnapshotId -> (string)
                     The ID of the snapshot.

                 VolumeSize -> (integer)
                     The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify  either
                     a  snapshot  ID  or a volume size. If you specify a snap-
                     shot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a
                     volume  size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot
                     size.

                     The following are the supported volumes  sizes  for  each
                     volume type:

                     o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                     o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                     o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                     o standard : 1-1,024

                 VolumeType -> (string)
                     The  volume  type.  For  more information, see Amazon EBS
                     volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . If the volume
                     type  is  io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS that the
                     volume supports.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN)  for
                     a  customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is en-
                     crypted.

                     This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects  called  by RunInstances , RequestSpotFleet , and
                     RequestSpotInstances .

                 Throughput -> (integer)
                     The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                     This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                     Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                 OutpostArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored.

                     This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects called by CreateImage .

                 Encrypted -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the encryption state of an EBS volume
                     is changed while being restored from a backing  snapshot.
                     The  effect  of  setting the encryption state to true de-
                     pends on the volume origin  (new  or  from  a  snapshot),
                     starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryp-
                     tion by default is enabled.  For  more  information,  see
                     Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                     In  no  case  can you remove encryption from an encrypted
                     volume.

                     Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances  that
                     support  Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see
                     Supported instance types .

                     This parameter is not returned by  DescribeImageAttribute
                     .

                     For  CreateImage and  RegisterImage , whether you can in-
                     clude this parameter, and the allowed values  differ  de-
                     pending  on the type of block device mapping you are cre-
                     ating.

                     o If you are creating a block device mapping  for  a  new
                       (empty)  volume  ,  you can include this parameter, and
                       specify either true for an encrypted volume,  or  false
                       for  an unencrypted volume. If you omit this parameter,
                       it defaults to false (unencrypted).

                     o If you are creating a block device mapping from an  ex-
                       isting  encrypted  or  unencrypted  snapshot , you must
                       omit this parameter. If you include this parameter, the
                       request  will  fail,  regardless  of the value that you
                       specify.

                     o If you are creating a block device mapping from an  ex-
                       isting unencrypted volume , you can include this param-
                       eter, but you must specify false . If you specify  true
                       ,  the  request  will  fail. In this case, we recommend
                       that you omit the parameter.

                     o If you are creating a block device mapping from an  ex-
                       isting  encrypted volume , you can include this parame-
                       ter, and specify either true or false . However, if you
                       specify  false , the parameter is ignored and the block
                       device mapping is always encrypted. In  this  case,  we
                       recommend that you omit the parameter.

              NoDevice -> (string)
                 To  omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an
                 empty string. When this property is specified, the device  is
                 removed  from  the block device mapping regardless of the as-
                 signed value.

       ImageId -> (string)
          The ID of the AMI.

       LaunchPermissions -> (list)
          The launch permissions.

          (structure)
              Describes a launch permission.

              Group -> (string)
                 The name of the group.

              UserId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID.

                 Constraints: Up to 10 000 account IDs can be specified  in  a
                 single request.

              OrganizationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization.

              OrganizationalUnitArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of an organizational unit
                 (OU).
