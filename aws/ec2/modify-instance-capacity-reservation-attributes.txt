NAME
       modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes -

DESCRIPTION

       this action to configure an instance  to  target  a  specific  Capacity
       Reservation,  run  in  any  open Capacity Reservation with matching at-
       tributes, run in On-Demand Instance capacity, or only run in a Capacity
       Reservation.

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance to be modified.

       --capacity-reservation-specification (structure)
          Information about the Capacity Reservation targeting option.

          CapacityReservationPreference -> (string)
              Indicates  the instance's Capacity Reservation preferences. Pos-
              sible preferences include:

              o capacity-reservations-only - The instance will only run  in  a
                Capacity  Reservation or Capacity Reservation group. If capac-
                ity isn't available, the instance will fail to launch.

              o open - The instance can run in any open  Capacity  Reservation
                that  has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Avail-
                ability Zone, and tenancy). If capacity isn't  available,  the
                instance runs as an On-Demand Instance.

              o none - The instance doesn't run in a Capacity Reservation even
                if one is available. The instance runs  as  an  On-Demand  In-
                stance.

          CapacityReservationTarget -> (structure)
              Information  about  the  target Capacity Reservation or Capacity
              Reservation group.

              CapacityReservationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Capacity Reservation in which to  run  the  in-
                 stance.

              CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the Capacity Reservation resource group in which
                 to run the instance.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CapacityReservationPreference=string,CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationId=string,CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CapacityReservationPreference": "capacity-reservations-only"|"open"|"none",
            "CapacityReservationTarget": {
              "CapacityReservationId": "string",
              "CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To modify an instance's capacity reservation targeting  set-
       tings

       The  following  modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes example
       modifies a stopped instance to target a specific capacity reservation.

          aws ec2 modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes \
              --instance-id i-EXAMPLE8765abcd4e \
              --capacity-reservation-specification 'CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationId= cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE }'

       Output:

          {
              "Return": true
          }

       Example 2: To modify an instance's capacity reservation targeting  set-
       tings

       The  following  modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes example
       modifies a stopped instance that targets the specified capacity  reser-
       vation  to  launch  in  any  capacity reservation that has matching at-
       tributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone) and that has open
       instance matching criteria.

          aws ec2 modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes \
              --instance-id i-EXAMPLE8765abcd4e \
              --capacity-reservation-specification 'CapacityReservationPreference=open'

       Output:

          {
              "Return": true
          }

       Settings in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide for  Linux  In-
       stances.

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns  true  if the request succeeds; otherwise, it returns an er-
          ror.
