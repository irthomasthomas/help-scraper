NAME
       describe-spot-instance-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified Spot Instance requests.

       You  can  use  DescribeSpotInstanceRequests  to find a running Spot In-
       stance by examining the response. If the status of the Spot Instance is
       fulfilled  ,  the  instance ID appears in the response and contains the
       identifier   of   the   instance.   Alternatively,    you    can    use
       DescribeInstances  with  a  filter  to look for instances where the in-
       stance lifecycle is spot .

       We recommend that you set MaxResults to a value between 5 and  1000  to
       limit  the  number  of items returned. This paginates the output, which
       makes the list more manageable and returns the  items  faster.  If  the
       list  of items exceeds your MaxResults value, then that number of items
       is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed to a subse-
       quent  DescribeSpotInstanceRequests  request  to retrieve the remaining
       items.

       Spot Instance requests are deleted four hours after they  are  canceled
       and their instances are terminated.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-spot-instance-requests  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: SpotInstanceRequests

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 2: To describe Spot Instance requests based on filters

       The following describe-spot-instance-requests example uses  filters  to
       scope the results to Spot Instance requests with the specified instance
       type in the specified Availability Zone. The example uses  the  --query
       parameter to display only the instance IDs.

          aws ec2 describe-spot-instance-requests \
              --filters Name=launch.instance-type,Values=m3.medium Name=launched-availability-zone,Values=us-east-2a \
              --query "SpotInstanceRequests[*].[InstanceId]" \
              --output text

       Output:

          i-057750d42936e468a
          i-001efd250faaa6ffa
          i-027552a73f021f3bd
          ...

       For  additional  examples using filters, see Listing and filtering your
       resources in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

       Example 3: To describe Spot Instance requests based on tags

       The following describe-spot-instance-requests example uses tag  filters
       to  scope  the  results  to  Spot  Instance  requests that have the tag
       cost-center=cc123.

          aws ec2 describe-spot-instance-requests \
              --filters Name=tag:cost-center,Values=cc123

       For an example of the output for  describe-spot-instance-requests,  see
       Example 1.

       For additional examples using tag filters, see Working with tags in the
       Amazon EC2 User Guide.

                 BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)
                     The block device mapping entries.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a block device mapping,  which  defines  the
                        EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an
                        instance at launch.

                            umes when the instance is launched.

                            DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                               Indicates  whether the EBS volume is deleted on
                               instance termination. For more information, see

                            Iops -> (integer)
                               The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS).
                               For  gp3  ,  io1 , and io2 volumes, this repre-
                               sents the number of IOPS that  are  provisioned
                               for  the  volume.  For gp2 volumes, this repre-
                               sents the baseline performance  of  the  volume
                               and  the  rate  at which the volume accumulates
                               I/O credits for bursting.

                               The following are the supported values for each
                               volume type:

                               o gp3 : 3,000 - 16,000 IOPS

                               o io1 : 100 - 64,000 IOPS

                               o io2 : 100 - 256,000 IOPS

                               For  io2 volumes, you can achieve up to 256,000
                               IOPS on instances built on the Nitro  System  .
                               On other instances, you can achieve performance
                               up to 32,000 IOPS.

                               This parameter is required for io1 and io2 vol-
                               umes.  The  default  for  gp3  volumes is 3,000
                               IOPS.

                            SnapshotId -> (string)
                               The ID of the snapshot.

                            VolumeSize -> (integer)
                               The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must spec-
                               ify  either  a snapshot ID or a volume size. If
                               you specify a  snapshot,  the  default  is  the
                               snapshot  size.  You  can specify a volume size
                               that is equal to or larger  than  the  snapshot
                               size.

                               The  following are the supported sizes for each
                               volume type:

                               o gp2 and gp3 : 1 - 16,384 GiB

                               o io1 : 4 - 16,384 GiB

                               o io2 : 4 - 65,536 GiB

                               o st1 and sc1 : 125 - 16,384 GiB

                               o standard : 1 - 1024 GiB

                            VolumeType -> (string)
                               The volume  type.  For  more  information,  see
                               Amazon  EBS volume types in the Amazon EBS User
                               Guide .

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias
                               ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the
                               EBS volume is encrypted.

                               This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDe-
                               viceMapping  objects  called  by RunInstances ,
                               RequestSpotFleet , and RequestSpotInstances .

                            Throughput -> (integer)
                               The throughput that  the  volume  supports,  in
                               MiB/s.

                               This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                               Valid  Range:  Minimum  value  of  125. Maximum
                               value of 1000.

                            OutpostArn -> (string)
                               The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is
                               stored.

                               This  parameter  is  not  supported  when using
                               CreateImage .

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               Indicates whether the encryption  state  of  an
                               EBS volume is changed while being restored from
                               a backing snapshot. The effect of  setting  the
                               encryption  state to true depends on the volume
                               origin (new or from a snapshot),  starting  en-
                               cryption  state, ownership, and whether encryp-
                               tion by default is enabled. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see  Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon
                               EBS User Guide .

                               In no case can you remove  encryption  from  an
                               encrypted volume.

                               Encrypted  volumes  can only be attached to in-
                               stances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For
                               more  information, see Supported instance types
                               .

                               This parameter is not returned by   DescribeIm-
                               ageAttribute .

                               For   CreateImage  and  RegisterImage , whether
                               you can include this parameter, and the allowed
                               values  differ  depending  on the type of block
                               device mapping you are creating.

                               o If you are creating a  block  device  mapping
                                 for  a  new  (empty) volume , you can include
                                 this parameter, and specify either  true  for
                                 an  encrypted  volume,  or false for an unen-
                                 crypted volume. If you omit  this  parameter,
                                 it defaults to false (unencrypted).

                               o If  you  are  creating a block device mapping
                                 from an  existing  encrypted  or  unencrypted
                                 snapshot  ,  you must omit this parameter. If
                                 you include this parameter, the request  will
                                 fail,  regardless of the value that you spec-
                                 ify.

                               o If you are creating a  block  device  mapping
                                 from an existing unencrypted volume , you can
                                 include this parameter, but you must  specify
                                 false  .  If  you  specify true , the request
                                 will fail. In this case,  we  recommend  that
                                 you omit the parameter.

                               o If  you  are  creating a block device mapping
                                 from an existing encrypted volume ,  you  can
                                 include  this  parameter,  and specify either
                                 true or false . However, if you specify false
                                 ,  the parameter is ignored and the block de-
                                 vice mapping is  always  encrypted.  In  this
                                 case,  we recommend that you omit the parame-
                                 ter.

                        NoDevice -> (string)
                            To omit the device from the block device  mapping,
                            specify  an  empty  string.  When this property is
                            specified, the device is removed  from  the  block
                            device mapping regardless of the assigned value.

                        DeviceName -> (string)
                            The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                        VirtualName -> (string)
                            The  virtual  device  name (ephemeral N). Instance
                            store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An in-
                            stance  type  with 2 available instance store vol-
                            umes  can  specify  mappings  for  ephemeral0  and
                            ephemeral1  .  The  number  of  available instance
                            store volumes depends on the instance type.  After
                            you  connect  to  the instance, you must mount the
                            volume.

                            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enu-
                            merated and assigned a device name. Including them
                            in your block device mapping has no effect.

                            Constraints: For M3 instances,  you  must  specify
                            instance store volumes in the block device mapping
                            for the instance. When you launch an M3  instance,
                            we  ignore any instance store volumes specified in
                            the block device mapping for the AMI.

                 EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the instance is optimized for EBS  I/O.
                     This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon
                     EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide opti-
                     mal  EBS  I/O performance. This optimization isn't avail-
                     able with all instance types.  Additional  usage  charges
                     apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.

                     Default: false

                 IamInstanceProfile -> (structure)
                     The IAM instance profile.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the instance pro-
                        file.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the instance profile.

                 ImageId -> (string)
                     The ID of the AMI.

                 InstanceType -> (string)
                     The instance type. Only one instance type can  be  speci-
                     fied.

                 KernelId -> (string)
                     The ID of the kernel.

                 KeyName -> (string)
                     The name of the key pair.

                 NetworkInterfaces -> (list)
                     The  network  interfaces. If you specify a network inter-
                     face, you must specify subnet IDs and security group  IDs
                     using the network interface.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a network interface.

                        AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)
                            Indicates  whether to assign a public IPv4 address
                            to an instance you launch in a VPC. The public  IP
                            address  can  only be assigned to a network inter-
                            face for eth0, and can only be assigned to  a  new
                            network interface, not an existing one. You cannot
                            specify more than one network interface in the re-
                            quest. If launching into a default subnet, the de-
                            fault value is true .

                            Amazon Web Services charges for  all  public  IPv4
                            addresses, including public IPv4 addresses associ-
                            ated with running instances  and  Elastic  IP  ad-
                            dresses. For more information, see the Public IPv4
                            Address tab on the Amazon VPC pricing page .

                        DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                            If set to true , the interface is deleted when the
                            instance  is terminated. You can specify true only
                            if creating a new network interface when launching

                                   address to be a  primary  IPv6,  the  first
                                   IPv6  GUA will be made the primary IPv6 ad-
                                   dress until the instance is  terminated  or
                                   the network interface is detached. For more
