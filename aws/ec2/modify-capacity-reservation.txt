MODIFY-CAPACITY-RESERVATION()                    MODIFY-CAPACITY-RESERVATION()



NAME
       modify-capacity-reservation -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a  Capacity Reservation's capacity, instance eligibility, and
       the conditions under which it is to be released. You can't modify a Ca-
       pacity  Reservation's  instance  type,  EBS optimization, platform, in-
       stance store settings, Availability Zone, or tenancy. If  you  need  to
       modify any of these attributes, we recommend that you cancel the Capac-
       ity Reservation, and then create  a  new  one  with  the  required  at-
       tributes.  For more information, see Modify an active Capacity Reserva-
       tion .

OPTIONS
       --capacity-reservation-id (string)
          The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

       --instance-count (integer)
          The number of instances for which to reserve capacity. The number of
          instances  can't  be  increased  or decreased by more than 1000 in a
          single request.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When  a
          Capacity  Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and
          you can no longer launch instances into it.  The  Capacity  Reserva-
          tion's  state  changes  to  expired when it reaches its end date and
          time.

          The Capacity Reservation is cancelled within an hour from the speci-
          fied  time. For example, if you specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the Ca-
          pacity  Reservation  is  guaranteed  to  end  between  13:30:55  and
          14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.

          You  must  provide an EndDate value if EndDateType is limited . Omit
          EndDate if EndDateType is unlimited .

       --end-date-type (string)
          Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity
          Reservation can have one of the following end types:

          o unlimited  - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you ex-
            plicitly cancel it. Do not provide an EndDate value if EndDateType
            is unlimited .

          o limited  -  The  Capacity  Reservation  expires automatically at a
            specified date and time. You must provide an EndDate value if End-
            DateType is limited .

          Possible values:

          o unlimited

          o limited

       --accept | --no-accept (boolean)
          Reserved. Capacity Reservations you have created are accepted by de-
          fault.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --additional-info (string)
          Reserved for future use.

       --instance-match-criteria (string)
          The matching criteria (instance eligibility) that you want to use in
          the modified Capacity Reservation. If you change the instance eligi-
          bility  of  an existing Capacity Reservation from targeted to open ,
          any running instances that match  the  attributes  of  the  Capacity
          Reservation,  have  the  CapacityReservationPreference set to open ,
          and are not yet running in the Capacity Reservation, will  automati-
          cally use the modified Capacity Reservation.

          To modify the instance eligibility, the Capacity Reservation must be
          completely idle (zero usage).

          Possible values:

          o open

          o targeted

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To change the number of instances reserved  by  an  existing
       capacity reservation

       The following modify-capacity-reservation example changes the number of
       instances for which the capacity reservation reserves capacity.

          aws ec2 modify-capacity-reservation \
              --capacity-reservation-id cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE \
              --instance-count 5

       Output:

          {
              "Return": true
          }

       Example 2: To change the end date and time  for  an  existing  capacity
       reservation

       The  following modify-capacity-reservation example modifies an existing
       capacity reservation to end at the specified date and time.

          aws ec2 modify-capacity-reservation \
              --capacity-reservation-id cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE \
              --end-date-type limited \
              --end-date 2019-08-31T23:59:59Z

       zon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide for Linux Instances.

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns  true  if the request succeeds; otherwise, it returns an er-
          ror.
