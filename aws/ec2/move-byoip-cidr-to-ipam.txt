MOVE-BYOIP-CIDR-TO-IPAM()                            MOVE-BYOIP-CIDR-TO-IPAM()



NAME
       move-byoip-cidr-to-ipam -

DESCRIPTION
       Move a BYOIPv4 CIDR to IPAM from a public IPv4 pool.

       If  you  already  have a BYOIPv4 CIDR with Amazon Web Services, you can
       move the CIDR to IPAM from a public IPv4 pool. You cannot move an  IPv6
       CIDR  to  IPAM. If you are bringing a new IP address to Amazon Web Ser-
       vices for the first time, complete the steps in Tutorial: BYOIP address
       CIDRs to IPAM .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cidr (string)
          The BYOIP CIDR.

       --ipam-pool-id (string)
          The IPAM pool ID.

       --ipam-pool-owner (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner of the IPAM pool.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To transfer a BYOIP CIDR to IPAM

       The following move-byoip-cidr-to-ipam example transfers a BYOIP CIDR to
       IPAM.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 move-byoip-cidr-to-ipam \
              --region us-west-2 \
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0a03d430ca3f5c035 \
              --ipam-pool-owner 111111111111 \
              --cidr 130.137.249.0/24

       (Windows):

          aws ec2 move-byoip-cidr-to-ipam ^
              --region us-west-2 ^
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0a03d430ca3f5c035 ^
              --ipam-pool-owner 111111111111 ^
              --cidr 130.137.249.0/24

       Output:

          {
              "ByoipCidr": {
                  "Cidr": "130.137.249.0/24",
                  "State": "pending-transfer"
              }
          }

       For more information, see Tutorial: Transfer  an  existing  BYOIP  IPv4
       CIDR to IPAM in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide.

              o deprovisioned : The address range is deprovisioned.

              o failed-deprovision  :  The  request to deprovision the address
                range was unsuccessful. Ensure that all EIPs  from  the  range
                have been deallocated and try again.

              o failed-provision  : The request to provision the address range
                was unsuccessful.

              o pending-deprovision : Youve submitted a request to deprovision

              If you have Local Zones enabled, you can choose a network border
              group for Local Zones when you provision and advertise a BYOIPv4
              CIDR. Choose the network border group carefully as the  EIP  and
              the  Amazon Web Services resource it is associated with must re-
              side in the same network border group.

              You can provision BYOIP address ranges to and advertise them  in
              the following Local Zone network border groups:

              o us-east-1-dfw-2

              o us-west-2-lax-1

              o us-west-2-phx-2

              NOTE:
                 You  cannot  provision or advertise BYOIPv6 address ranges in
                 Local Zones at this time.
