RELEASE-IPAM-POOL-ALLOCATION()                  RELEASE-IPAM-POOL-ALLOCATION()



NAME
       release-ipam-pool-allocation -

DESCRIPTION
       Release an allocation within an IPAM pool. The Region you use should be
       the IPAM pool locale. The locale is  the  Amazon  Web  Services  Region
       where  this  IPAM  pool  is available for allocations. You can only use
       this action to release manual allocations. To remove an allocation  for
       a  resource  without  deleting the resource, set its monitored state to
       false using ModifyIpamResourceCidr . For more information, see  Release
       an allocation in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
          All EC2 API actions follow an eventual consistency model.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM pool which contains the allocation  you  want  to
          release.

       --cidr (string)
          The CIDR of the allocation you want to release.

       --ipam-pool-allocation-id (string)
          The ID of the allocation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To release an IPAM pool allocation

       In this example, you're an IPAM delegated admin who tried to delete  an
       IPAM  pool  but received an error that you cannot delete the pool while
       the pool has allocations. You are using this command to release a  pool
       allocation.

       Note the following:

       o You  can  only  use this command for custom allocations. To remove an
         allocation for a resource without deleting the resource, set its mon-
         itored state to false using modify-ipam-resource-cidr.

       o To complete this request, you'll need the IPAM pool ID, which you can
         get with describe-ipam-pools. You'll also  need  the  allocation  ID,
         which you can get with get-ipam-pool-allocations.

       o If  you do not want to remove allocations one by one, you can use the
         --cascade option when you delete an IPAM pool  to  automatically  re-
         lease any allocations in the pool before deleting it.

       o There  are a number of prerequisites before running this command. For
         more information, see Release an allocation in the  Amazon  VPC  IPAM
         User Guide.

       o The  --region in which you run this command must be the locale of the
         IPAM pool where the allocation is.

       The following release-ipam-pool-allocation  example  releases  an  IPAM
       pool allocation.

          aws ec2 release-ipam-pool-allocation \
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-07bdd12d7c94e4693 \
              --cidr 10.0.0.0/23 \
              --ipam-pool-allocation-id ipam-pool-alloc-0e66a1f730da54791b99465b79e7d1e89 \
              --region us-west-1

       Output:

          {
              "Success": true
          }

       Once you release an allocation, you may want to run delete-ipam-pool.

OUTPUT
       Success -> (boolean)
          Indicates if the release was successful.
