MODIFY-IPAM-RESOURCE-CIDR()                        MODIFY-IPAM-RESOURCE-CIDR()



NAME
       modify-ipam-resource-cidr -

DESCRIPTION
       Modify  a  resource  CIDR. You can use this action to transfer resource
       CIDRs between scopes and ignore resource CIDRs that you do not want  to
       manage.  If set to false, the resource will not be tracked for overlap,
       it cannot be auto-imported into a pool, and it will be removed from any
       pool it has an allocation in.

       For more information, see Move resource CIDRs between scopes and Change
       the monitoring state of resource CIDRs in  the  Amazon  VPC  IPAM  User
       Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the resource you want to modify.

       --resource-cidr (string)
          The CIDR of the resource you want to modify.

       --resource-region (string)
          The Amazon Web Services Region of the resource you want to modify.

       --current-ipam-scope-id (string)
          The ID of the current scope that the resource CIDR is in.

       --destination-ipam-scope-id (string)
          The ID of the scope you want to transfer the resource CIDR to.

       --monitored | --no-monitored (boolean)
          Determines if the resource is monitored by IPAM. If  a  resource  is
          monitored,  the  resource is discovered by IPAM and you can view de-
          tails about the resources CIDR.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              resource.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              The ID of an IPAM resource.

          ResourceName -> (string)
              The name of an IPAM resource.

          ResourceCidr -> (string)
              The CIDR for an IPAM resource.

          ResourceType -> (string)
              The type of IPAM resource.

          ResourceTags -> (list)
              The tags for an IPAM resource.

              (structure)
                 The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the  resource.
                 Use  the  tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the
                 filter value. For example, to find all resources that have  a
                 tag  with  the  key  Owner  and  the  value  TeamA  , specify
                 tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this  fil-
                     ter  to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific
                     key, regardless of the tag value.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

          IpUsage -> (double)
              The percentage of IP address space in use. To convert the  deci-
              mal  to a percentage, multiply the decimal by 100. Note the fol-
              lowing:

              o For a resources that are VPCs, this is the  percentage  of  IP
                address space in the VPC that's taken up by subnet CIDRs.

              o For resources that are subnets, if the subnet has an IPv4 CIDR
                provisioned to it, this is  the  percentage  of  IPv4  address
                space  in  the subnet that's in use. If the subnet has an IPv6
                CIDR provisioned to it, the percentage of IPv6  address  space
                in  use  is  not  represented.  The percentage of IPv6 address
                space in use cannot currently be calculated.

              o For resources that are public IPv4 pools, this is the percent-
                age  of  IP address space in the pool that's been allocated to
                Elastic IP addresses (EIPs).

          ComplianceStatus -> (string)
              The compliance status of the IPAM resource. For more information
              on  compliance  statuses,  see Monitor CIDR usage by resource in
              the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

          ManagementState -> (string)
              The management state of the resource. For more information about
              management  states,  see  Monitor  CIDR usage by resource in the
              Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

          OverlapStatus -> (string)
              The overlap status of an IPAM resource. The overlap status tells
              you if the CIDR for a resource overlaps with another CIDR in the
              scope. For more information on  overlap  statuses,  see  Monitor
              CIDR usage by resource in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

          VpcId -> (string)
              The ID of a VPC.
