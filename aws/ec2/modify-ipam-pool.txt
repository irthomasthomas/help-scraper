OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM pool you want to modify.

       --description (string)
          The description of the IPAM pool you want to modify.

       --auto-import | --no-auto-import (boolean)
          If  true,  IPAM will continuously look for resources within the CIDR
          range of this pool and automatically import them as allocations into
          your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for these resources must
          not already be allocated to other resources in order for the  import
          to  succeed.  IPAM  will  import a CIDR regardless of its compliance
          with the pool's allocation rules, so a resource  might  be  imported
          and  subsequently marked as noncompliant. If IPAM discovers multiple
          CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will import the largest CIDR only. If  IPAM
          discovers multiple CIDRs with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly im-
          port one of them only.

          A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.

       --allocation-min-netmask-length (integer)
          The minimum netmask length required for  CIDR  allocations  in  this
          IPAM  pool  to  be  compliant. Possible netmask lengths for IPv4 ad-
          dresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses  are
          0  -  128.  The minimum netmask length must be less than the maximum
          netmask length.

       --allocation-max-netmask-length (integer)
          The maximum netmask length possible for  CIDR  allocations  in  this
          IPAM  pool  to  be  compliant. Possible netmask lengths for IPv4 ad-
          dresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses  are
          0  - 128.The maximum netmask length must be greater than the minimum
          netmask length.

       --allocation-default-netmask-length (integer)
          The default netmask length for allocations added to this  pool.  If,
          for  example,  the  CIDR assigned to this pool is 10.0.0.0/8 and you
          enter 16 here, new allocations will default to 10.0.0.0/16.

       --clear-allocation-default-netmask-length  |  --no-clear-allocation-de-
       fault-netmask-length (boolean)
          Clear the default netmask length allocation rule for this pool.

       --add-allocation-resource-tags (list)
          Add tag allocation rules to a pool. For more information about allo-
          cation rules, see Create a top-level pool in  the  Amazon  VPC  IPAM
          User Guide .

          (structure)
              A tag on an IPAM resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to
                 find all resources assigned a tag with a  specific  key,  re-
                 gardless of the tag value.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --remove-allocation-resource-tags (list)
          Remove tag allocation rules from a pool.

          (structure)
              A tag on an IPAM resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to
                 find all resources assigned a tag with a  specific  key,  re-
                 gardless of the tag value.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify an IPAM pool

       The following modify-ipam-pool example modifies an IPAM pool.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 modify-ipam-pool \
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0533048da7d823723 \
              --add-allocation-resource-tags "Key=Owner,Value=Build Team" \
              --clear-allocation-default-netmask-length \
              --allocation-min-netmask-length 14

       (Windows):

          aws ec2 modify-ipam-pool ^

OUTPUT
       IpamPool -> (structure)
          The results of the modification.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Web  Services  account  ID of the owner of the IPAM
              pool.

          IpamPoolId -> (string)
              The ID of the IPAM pool.

          SourceIpamPoolId -> (string)
              The ID of the source IPAM pool. You can use this option to  cre-
              ate an IPAM pool within an existing source pool.

          IpamPoolArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IPAM pool.

          IpamScopeArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the scope of the IPAM pool.

          IpamScopeType -> (string)
              In  IPAM, a scope is the highest-level container within IPAM. An
              IPAM contains two default scopes. Each scope represents  the  IP
              space  for  a  single network. The private scope is intended for
              all private IP address space. The public scope is  intended  for
              all  public  IP address space. Scopes enable you to reuse IP ad-
              dresses across multiple unconnected networks without causing  IP
              address overlap or conflict.

          IpamArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IPAM.

          IpamRegion -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region of the IPAM pool.

          Locale -> (string)
              The locale of the IPAM pool.

              The locale for the pool should be one of the following:

              o An Amazon Web Services Region where you want this IPAM pool to
                be available for allocations.

              o The network border group for an Amazon Web Services Local Zone
                where  you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations
                (supported Local Zones ). This option is  only  available  for
                IPAM IPv4 pools in the public scope.

              If  you choose an Amazon Web Services Region for locale that has
              not been configured as an operating Region for the IPAM,  you'll
              get an error.

          PoolDepth -> (integer)
              The  depth  of  pools in your IPAM pool. The pool depth quota is
              10. For more information, see Quotas in IPAM in the  Amazon  VPC
              IPAM User Guide .

          State -> (string)
              The state of the IPAM pool.

          StateMessage -> (string)
              The state message.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the IPAM pool.

          AutoImport -> (boolean)
              If  selected,  IPAM  will continuously look for resources within
              the CIDR range of this pool and automatically import them as al-
              locations  into  your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for
              these resources must not already be allocated to other resources
              in  order for the import to succeed. IPAM will import a CIDR re-
              gardless of its compliance with the pool's allocation rules,  so
              a  resource might be imported and subsequently marked as noncom-
              pliant. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will
              import  the  largest CIDR only. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs
              with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly import one of them only.

              A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.

          PubliclyAdvertisable -> (boolean)
              Determines if a pool is publicly advertisable.  This  option  is
              not available for pools with AddressFamily set to ipv4 .

          AddressFamily -> (string)
              The address family of the pool.

          AllocationMinNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The minimum netmask length required for CIDR allocations in this
              IPAM pool to be compliant. The minimum netmask  length  must  be
              less  than  the maximum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths
              for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6
              addresses are 0 - 128.

          AllocationMaxNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The maximum netmask length possible for CIDR allocations in this
              IPAM pool to be compliant. The maximum netmask  length  must  be
              greater  than  the  minimum  netmask  length.  Possible  netmask
              lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask  lengths
              for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.

          AllocationDefaultNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The  default  netmask length for allocations added to this pool.
              If, for example, the CIDR assigned to this  pool  is  10.0.0.0/8
              and   you  enter  16  here,  new  allocations  will  default  to
              10.0.0.0/16.

          AllocationResourceTags -> (list)
              Tags that are required for resources that use  CIDRs  from  this
              IPAM pool. Resources that do not have these tags will not be al-
              lowed to allocate space from the pool.  If  the  resources  have
              their tags changed after they have allocated space or if the al-
              location tagging requirements are changed on the pool,  the  re-
              source may be marked as noncompliant.

              (structure)
                 The  key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
                 Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as  the
                 filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
                 tag with  the  key  Owner  and  the  value  TeamA  ,  specify
                 tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
                     ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a  specific
                     key, regardless of the tag value.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use
              the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as  the  filter
              value.  For  example, to find all resources that have a tag with
              the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify  tag:Owner  for  the
              filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  keys  are  case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 127 Unicode characters.  May  not  begin  with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  values are case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

          AwsService -> (string)
              Limits which service in Amazon Web Services that the pool can be
