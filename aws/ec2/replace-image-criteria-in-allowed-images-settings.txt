NAME
       replace-image-criteria-in-allowed-images-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets or replaces the criteria for Allowed AMIs.

       NOTE:
          The  Allowed  AMIs  feature does not restrict the AMIs owned by your
          account. Regardless of the criteria you set,  the  AMIs  created  by
          your account will always be discoverable and usable by users in your
          account.

       For more information, see Control the discovery and use of AMIs in Ama-
       zon EC2 with Allowed AMIs in Amazon EC2 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --image-criteria (list)
          The  list  of  criteria that are evaluated to determine whether AMIs

              The  list  of criteria that are evaluated to determine whch AMIs
              are discoverable and usable in the account in the specified Ama-

              be specified are AMI providers.

              Up to 10 imageCriteria objects can be specified, and up to a to-
              tal of 200 values for all imageProviders . For more information,
              see JSON configuration for the Allowed AMIs criteria in the Ama-

              ImageProviders -> (list)
                 A  list  of  image  providers whose AMIs are discoverable and
                 useable in the account. Up to a total of 200  values  can  be
                 specified.

                 Possible values:
                     amazon : Allow AMIs created by Amazon Web Services.

                     aws-marketplace   :   Allow   AMIs  created  by  verified
                     providers in the Amazon Web Services Marketplace.

                 or more account IDs can be specified.
                     none : Allow AMIs created by your own account only.  When

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ImageProviders=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ImageProviders": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
