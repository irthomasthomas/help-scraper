NAME
       create-ipam -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an  IPAM. Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) is a VPC feature
       that you can use to automate your IP address management  workflows  in-
       cluding assigning, tracking, troubleshooting, and auditing IP addresses
       across Amazon Web Services Regions and accounts throughout your  Amazon
       Web Services Organization.

       For  more  information,  see Create an IPAM in the Amazon VPC IPAM User
       Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --description (string)
          A description for the IPAM.

       --operating-regions (list)
          The operating Regions for the IPAM. Operating Regions are Amazon Web
          Services Regions where the IPAM is  allowed  to  manage  IP  address
          CIDRs.  IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in the Amazon Web
          Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

          For more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM  in
          the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

          (structure)
              Add an operating Region to an IPAM. Operating Regions are Amazon
              Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage IP  ad-
              dress  CIDRs.  IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in the
              Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

              For more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM
              in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the operating Region.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegionName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the
          tag key in the filter name and the tag value as  the  filter  value.
          For  example,  to  find  all  resources that have a tag with the key
          Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for  the  filter  name
          and TeamA for the filter value.

          (structure)
              The  tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being cre-
              ated.

              NOTE:
                 The Valid Values lists all the resource  types  that  can  be
                 tagged.  However,  the  action you're using might not support
                 tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a  re-
                 source  type that is unsupported for the action you're using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensuring Idem-
          potency .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
