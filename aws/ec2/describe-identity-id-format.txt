DESCRIBE-IDENTITY-ID-FORMAT()                    DESCRIBE-IDENTITY-ID-FORMAT()



NAME
       describe-identity-id-format -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  ID  format settings for resources for the specified IAM
       user, IAM role, or root user. For example, you can  view  the  resource
       types that are enabled for longer IDs. This request only returns infor-
       mation about resource types whose ID formats can be modified;  it  does
       not  return  information  about other resource types. For more informa-
       tion, see Resource IDs in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       The following resource types  support  longer  IDs:  bundle  |  conver-
       sion-task  |  customer-gateway | dhcp-options | elastic-ip-allocation |
       elastic-ip-association | export-task | flow-log | image | import-task |
       instance  |  internet-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association |
       network-interface | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list | reser-
       vation | route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snap-
       shot  |  subnet  |  subnet-cidr-block-association  |  volume  |  vpc  |
       vpc-cidr-block-association  |  vpc-endpoint  | vpc-peering-connection |
       vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

       These settings apply to the principal specified in the request. They do
       not apply to the principal that makes the request.

OPTIONS
       --principal-arn (string)
          The ARN of the principal, which can be an IAM role, IAM user, or the
          root user.

       --resource (string)
          The type of resource: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway  |
          dhcp-options  | elastic-ip-allocation | elastic-ip-association | ex-
          port-task | flow-log | image  |  import-task  |  instance  |  inter-
          net-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association | network-inter-
          face | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list  |  reservation  |
          route-table  | route-table-association | security-group | snapshot |
          subnet  |   subnet-cidr-block-association   |   volume   |   vpc   |
          vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint | vpc-peering-connection |
          vpn-connection | vpn-gateway

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe the ID format for an IAM role

       The following describe-identity-id-format example describes the ID for-
       mat received by instances created by the IAM role EC2Role in  your  AWS
       account.

          aws ec2 describe-identity-id-format \
              --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-iam-role \
              --resource instance

       The  following output indicates that instances created by this role re-
       ceive IDs in long ID format.

          {
              "Statuses": [
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2016-12-15T00:00:00Z",
                      "Resource": "instance",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  }
              ]
          }

       To describe the ID format for an IAM user

       The following describe-identity-id-format example describes the ID for-
       mat received by snapshots created by the IAM user AdminUser in your AWS
       account.

          aws ec2 describe-identity-id-format \
              --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/AdminUser \
              --resource snapshot

       The output indicates that snapshots created by this user receive IDs in
       long ID format.

          {
              "Statuses": [
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2016-12-15T00:00:00Z",
                      "Resource": "snapshot",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Statuses -> (list)
          Information about the ID format for the resources.

          (structure)
              Describes the ID format for a resource.

              Deadline -> (timestamp)
                 The date in UTC at which you are permanently switched over to
                 using longer IDs. If a deadline is not yet available for this
                 resource type, this field is not returned.

              Resource -> (string)
                 The type of resource.

              UseLongIds -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  longer IDs (17-character IDs) are enabled
                 for the resource.
