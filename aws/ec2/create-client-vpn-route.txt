CREATE-CLIENT-VPN-ROUTE()                            CREATE-CLIENT-VPN-ROUTE()



NAME
       create-client-vpn-route -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a  route  to  a network to a Client VPN endpoint. Each Client VPN
       endpoint has a route table that  describes  the  available  destination
       network  routes.  Each  route in the route table specifies the path for
       trac to specic resources or networks.

OPTIONS
       --client-vpn-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the Client VPN endpoint to which to add the route.

       --destination-cidr-block (string)
          The IPv4 address range, in CIDR notation, of the route  destination.
          For example:

          o To add a route for Internet access, enter 0.0.0.0/0

          o To  add a route for a peered VPC, enter the peered VPC's IPv4 CIDR
            range

          o To add a route for an on-premises network, enter  the  Amazon  Web
            Services Site-to-Site VPN connection's IPv4 CIDR range

          o To add a route for the local network, enter the client CIDR range

       --target-vpc-subnet-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the subnet through which you want to route traffic. The
          specified subnet must be an existing target network  of  the  Client
          VPN endpoint.

          Alternatively, if you're adding a route for the local network, spec-
          ify local .

       --description (string)
          A brief description of the route.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. For more information, see How to ensure
          idempotency .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a route for a Client VPN endpoint

       The  following  create-client-vpn-route example adds a route to the in-
       ternet (0.0.0.0/0) for the specified subnet of the Client VPN endpoint.

          aws ec2 create-client-vpn-route \
              --client-vpn-endpoint-id cvpn-endpoint-123456789123abcde \
              --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0  \
              --target-vpc-subnet-id subnet-0123456789abcabca

       Output:

          {
              "Status": {
                  "Code": "creating"
              }
          }

       For more information, see Routes in the AWS  Client  VPN  Administrator
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (structure)
          The current state of the route.

          Code -> (string)
              The state of the Client VPN endpoint route.

          Message -> (string)
              A  message about the status of the Client VPN endpoint route, if
              applicable.
