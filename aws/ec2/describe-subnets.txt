NAME
       describe-subnets -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  your  subnets.  The default is to describe all your subnets.
       Alternatively, you can specify specific subnet IDs or  filter  the  re-
       sults to include only the subnets that match specific criteria.

       For more information, see Subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-subnets  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Subnets

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o availability-zone - The Availability Zone for the subnet. You  can
            also use availabilityZone as the filter name.

          o availability-zone-id  -  The  ID  of the Availability Zone for the
            subnet. You can also use availabilityZoneId as the filter name.

          o available-ip-address-count - The number of IPv4 addresses  in  the
            subnet that are available.

          o cidr-block - The IPv4 CIDR block of the subnet. The CIDR block you
            specify must exactly match the subnet's CIDR block for information
            to  be returned for the subnet. You can also use cidr or cidrBlock
            as the filter names.

          o customer-owned-ipv4-pool - The customer-owned  IPv4  address  pool
            associated with the subnet.

          o default-for-az  - Indicates whether this is the default subnet for
            the Availability Zone (true | false ). You can also  use  default-
            ForAz as the filter name.

          o enable-dns64  -  Indicates  whether  DNS  queries made to the Ama-
            zon-provided DNS Resolver in this subnet should  return  synthetic
            IPv6 addresses for IPv4-only destinations.

          o enable-lni-at-device-index - Indicates the device position for lo-
            cal network interfaces in this subnet. For  example,  1  indicates
            local  network interfaces in this subnet are the secondary network
            interface (eth1).

          o ipv6-cidr-block-association.ipv6-cidr-block - An IPv6  CIDR  block
            associated with the subnet.

          o ipv6-cidr-block-association.association-id - An association ID for
            an IPv6 CIDR block associated with the subnet.

          o ipv6-cidr-block-association.state - The  state  of  an  IPv6  CIDR
            block associated with the subnet.

          o ipv6-native  - Indicates whether this is an IPv6 only subnet (true
            | false ).

          o map-customer-owned-ip-on-launch - Indicates whether a network  in-
            terface created in this subnet (including a network interface cre-
            ated by  RunInstances ) receives a customer-owned IPv4 address.

          o map-public-ip-on-launch - Indicates whether instances launched  in
            this subnet receive a public IPv4 address.

          o outpost-arn - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost.

          o owner-id - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
            subnet.

          o private-dns-name-options-on-launch.hostname-type  -  The  type  of
            hostname  to  assign  to  instances  in  the subnet at launch. For
            IPv4-only and dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) subnets, an instance  DNS
            name  can  be  based on the instance IPv4 address (ip-name) or the
            instance ID (resource-name). For IPv6 only  subnets,  an  instance
            DNS name must be based on the instance ID (resource-name).

          o private-dns-name-options-on-launch.enable-re-
            source-name-dns-a-record - Indicates whether  to  respond  to  DNS
            queries for instance hostnames with DNS A records.

          o private-dns-name-options-on-launch.enable-re-
            source-name-dns-aaaa-record - Indicates whether to respond to  DNS
            queries for instance hostnames with DNS AAAA records.

          o state - The state of the subnet (pending | available ).

          o subnet-arn - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the subnet.

          o subnet-id - The ID of the subnet.

          o tag - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
            Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter
            value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the
            key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for  the  filter
            name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,  re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o vpc-id - The ID of the VPC for the subnet.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The IDs of the subnets.

          Default: Describes all your subnets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 3: To describe the subnets with a specific tag

       The following describe-subnets example uses a filter  to  retrieve  the
       details  of  those  subnets with the tag CostCenter=123 and the --query
       parameter to display the subnet IDs of the subnets with this tag.

          aws ec2 describe-subnets \
              --filters "Name=tag:CostCenter,Values=123" \
              --query "Subnets[*].SubnetId" \
