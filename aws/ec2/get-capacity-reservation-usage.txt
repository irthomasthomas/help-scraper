GET-CAPACITY-RESERVATION-USAGE()              GET-CAPACITY-RESERVATION-USAGE()



NAME
       get-capacity-reservation-usage -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  usage  information  about a Capacity Reservation. If the Capacity
       Reservation is shared, it shows  usage  information  for  the  Capacity
       Reservation  owner  and  each  Amazon Web Services account that is cur-
       rently using the shared capacity. If the Capacity  Reservation  is  not
       shared, it shows only the Capacity Reservation owner's usage.

OPTIONS
       --capacity-reservation-id (string)
          The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results to return for the request in a single
          page. The remaining results can be seen by sending  another  request
          with  the  returned nextToken value. This value can be between 5 and
          500. If maxResults is given a larger value than 500, you receive  an
          error.

          Valid range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 1000.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view capacity reservation usage across AWS accounts

       The following get-capacity-reservation-usage example displays usage in-
       formation for the specified capacity reservation.

          aws ec2 get-capacity-reservation-usage \
              --capacity-reservation-id cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.

       CapacityReservationId -> (string)
          The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

       InstanceType -> (string)
          The type of instance for which the Capacity Reservation reserves ca-
          pacity.

       TotalInstanceCount -> (integer)
          The number of instances for which the Capacity Reservation  reserves
          capacity.

       AvailableInstanceCount -> (integer)
          The  remaining  capacity. Indicates the number of instances that can
          be launched in the Capacity Reservation.

       State -> (string)
          The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A  Capacity  Reserva-
          tion can be in one of the following states:

          o active  -  The  Capacity Reservation is active and the capacity is
            available for your use.

          o expired - The Capacity Reservation expired  automatically  at  the
            date  and time specified in your request. The reserved capacity is
            no longer available for your use.

            capacity is no longer available for your use.

          o pending  - The Capacity Reservation request was successful but the
            capacity provisioning is still pending.

          o failed - The Capacity Reservation request has  failed.  A  request
            might  fail  due  to  invalid  request  parameters,  capacity con-
            straints, or instance limit constraints. Failed requests  are  re-
            tained for 60 minutes.

       InstanceUsages -> (list)

                 The number of instances the Amazon Web Services account  cur-
                 rently has in the Capacity Reservation.
