MODIFY-INSTANCE-EVENT-WINDOW()                  MODIFY-INSTANCE-EVENT-WINDOW()



NAME
       modify-instance-event-window -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the specified event window.

       You  can  define  either a set of time ranges or a cron expression when
       modifying the event window, but not both.

       To modify the targets associated with the event window, use the   Asso-
       ciateInstanceEventWindow and  DisassociateInstanceEventWindow API.

       If  Amazon  Web  Services  has already scheduled an event, modifying an
       event window won't change the time of the scheduled event.

       For more information, see Define event windows for scheduled events  in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --name (string)
          The name of the event window.

       --instance-event-window-id (string)
          The ID of the event window.

       --time-ranges (list)
          The time ranges of the event window.

          (structure)
              The start day and time and the end day  and  time  of  the  time
              range, in UTC.

              StartWeekDay -> (string)
                 The day on which the time range begins.

              StartHour -> (integer)
                 The hour when the time range begins.

              EndWeekDay -> (string)

              EndHour -> (integer)
                 The hour when the time range ends.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartWeekDay=string,StartHour=integer,EndWeekDay=string,EndHour=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "StartWeekDay": "sunday"|"monday"|"tuesday"|"wednesday"|"thursday"|"friday"|"saturday",
              "StartHour": integer,
              "EndWeekDay": "sunday"|"monday"|"tuesday"|"wednesday"|"thursday"|"friday"|"saturday",

       --cron-expression (string)
          The  cron expression of the event window, for example, * 0-4,20-23 *
          * 1,5 .

          Constraints:

          o Only hour and day of the week values are supported.

          o For day of the week values, you  can  specify  either  integers  0
            through 6 , or alternative single values SUN through SAT .

          o The minute, month, and year must be specified by * .

          o The  hour  value must be one or a multiple range, for example, 0-4
            or 0-4,20-23 .

          o Each hour range must be >= 2 hours, for example, 0-2 or 20-23 .

          o The event window must be >=  4  hours.  The  combined  total  time
            ranges in the event window must be >= 4 hours.

          For  more  information  about  cron  expressions,  see  cron  on the
          Wikipedia website .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To modify the time range of an event window

       The  following  modify-instance-event-window  example modifies the time
       range of an event window. Specify the time-range  parameter  to  modify
       the time range. You can't also specify the cron-expression parameter.

          aws ec2 modify-instance-event-window \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --instance-event-window-id iew-0abcdef1234567890
              --time-range StartWeekDay=monday,StartHour=2,EndWeekDay=wednesday,EndHour=8

       Output:

       The following modify-instance-event-window example  modifies  the  time
       range  of  an  event window. Specify the time-range parameter to modify
