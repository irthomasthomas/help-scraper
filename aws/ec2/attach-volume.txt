ATTACH-VOLUME()                                                ATTACH-VOLUME()



NAME
       attach-volume -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches  an EBS volume to a running or stopped instance and exposes it
       to the instance with the specified device name.

       Encrypted EBS volumes must be attached to instances that support Amazon
       EBS  encryption. For more information, see Amazon EBS encryption in the
       Amazon EBS User Guide .

       After you attach an EBS volume, you must make it  available.  For  more
       information, see Make an EBS volume available for use .

       If a volume has an Amazon Web Services Marketplace product code:

       o The volume can be attached only to a stopped instance.

       o Amazon  Web  Services  Marketplace  product codes are copied from the
         volume to the instance.

       o You must be subscribed to the product.

       o The instance type and operating system of the instance  must  support
         the  product.  For  example, you can't detach a volume from a Windows
         instance and attach it to a Linux instance.

       For more information, see Attach an Amazon EBS volume to an instance in
       the Amazon EBS User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --device (string)
          The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance.

       --volume-id (string)
          The ID of the EBS volume. The volume and instance must be within the
          same Availability Zone.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To attach a volume to an instance

       This example command attaches a volume  (vol-1234567890abcdef0)  to  an
       instance (i-01474ef662b89480) as /dev/sdf.

       Command:

          aws ec2 attach-volume --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0 --instance-id i-01474ef662b89480 --device /dev/sdf

       Output:

          {
              "AttachTime": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.000Z",
              "InstanceId": "i-01474ef662b89480",
              "VolumeId": "vol-1234567890abcdef0",
              "State": "attaching",

          null .

       InstanceId -> (string)
          The ID of the instance.

          If the volume is attached to a Fargate task, this parameter  returns
          null .

       State -> (string)
          The attachment state of the volume.

       VolumeId -> (string)
          The ID of the volume.
