MODIFY-SUBNET-ATTRIBUTE()                            MODIFY-SUBNET-ATTRIBUTE()



NAME
       modify-subnet-attribute -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a  subnet  attribute.  You can only modify one attribute at a
       time.

       Use this action to modify subnets on Amazon Web Services Outposts.

       o To modify a subnet on an Outpost rack, set both MapCustomerOwnedIpOn-
         Launch and CustomerOwnedIpv4Pool . These two parameters act as a sin-
         gle attribute.

       o To modify a subnet on an Outpost server, set either  EnableLniAtDevi-
         ceIndex or DisableLniAtDeviceIndex .

       For  more  information about Amazon Web Services Outposts, see the fol-
       lowing:

OPTIONS
       --assign-ipv6-address-on-creation  |   --no-assign-ipv6-address-on-cre-
       ation (structure)
          Specify  true  to  indicate  that  network interfaces created in the
          specified subnet should be assigned an IPv6 address. This includes a
          network interface that's created when launching an instance into the
          subnet (the instance therefore receives an IPv6 address).

          If you enable the IPv6 addressing feature for your subnet, your net-
          work  interface  or  instance  only receives an IPv6 address if it's
          created using version 2016-11-15 or later of the Amazon EC2 API.

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --map-public-ip-on-launch | --no-map-public-ip-on-launch (structure)
          Specify true to indicate that network  interfaces  attached  to  in-
          stances  created in the specified subnet should be assigned a public
          IPv4 address.

          Amazon Web Services charges for all public IPv4 addresses, including
          public  IPv4 addresses associated with running instances and Elastic
          IP addresses. For more information, see the Public IPv4 Address  tab
          on the Amazon VPC pricing page .

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --subnet-id (string)
          The ID of the subnet.

       --map-customer-owned-ip-on-launch            |            --no-map-cus-
       tomer-owned-ip-on-launch (structure)
          Specify true to indicate that network  interfaces  attached  to  in-
          stances  created  in  the specified subnet should be assigned a cus-
          tomer-owned IPv4 address.

          When this value is true , you must  specify  the  customer-owned  IP
          pool using CustomerOwnedIpv4Pool .

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --customer-owned-ipv4-pool (string)
          The customer-owned IPv4 address pool associated with the subnet.

          You   must  set  this  value  when  you  specify  true  for  MapCus-
          tomerOwnedIpOnLaunch .

       --enable-dns64 | --no-enable-dns64 (structure)
          Indicates whether DNS queries made to the  Amazon-provided  DNS  Re-
          solver  in  this  subnet  should return synthetic IPv6 addresses for
          IPv4-only destinations.

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --private-dns-hostname-type-on-launch (string)
          The type of hostname to assign to instances in the subnet at launch.
          For  IPv4-only  and  dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) subnets, an instance
          DNS name can be based on the instance IPv4 address (ip-name) or  the
          instance  ID (resource-name). For IPv6 only subnets, an instance DNS
          name must be based on the instance ID (resource-name).

          Possible values:

          o ip-name

          o resource-name

       --enable-resource-name-dns-a-record-on-launch     |     --no-enable-re-
       source-name-dns-a-record-on-launch (structure)
          Indicates  whether  to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames
          with DNS A records.

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --enable-resource-name-dns-aaaa-record-on-launch   |    --no-enable-re-
       source-name-dns-aaaa-record-on-launch (structure)
          Indicates  whether  to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames
          with DNS AAAA records.

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --enable-lni-at-device-index (integer)
          Indicates the device position for local network interfaces  in  this
          subnet.  For  example,  1 indicates local network interfaces in this
          subnet are the secondary network interface (eth1). A  local  network
          interface cannot be the primary network interface (eth0).

       --disable-lni-at-device-index     |    --no-disable-lni-at-device-index
       (structure)
          Specify true to indicate that local network interfaces at  the  cur-
          rent position should be disabled.

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To change a subnet's public IPv4 addressing behavior

       This  example  modifies  subnet-1a2b3c4d  to specify that all instances
       launched into this subnet are assigned a public IPv4  address.  If  the
       command succeeds, no output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 modify-subnet-attribute --subnet-id subnet-1a2b3c4d --map-public-ip-on-launch

       To change a subnet's IPv6 addressing behavior

       This  example  modifies  subnet-1a2b3c4d  to specify that all instances
       launched into this subnet are assigned an IPv6 address from  the  range
       of the subnet.

       Command:

          aws ec2 modify-subnet-attribute --subnet-id subnet-1a2b3c4d --assign-ipv6-address-on-creation

       Private Cloud User Guide.
