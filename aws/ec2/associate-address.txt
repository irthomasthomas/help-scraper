ASSOCIATE-ADDRESS()                                        ASSOCIATE-ADDRESS()



NAME
       associate-address -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  an Elastic IP address, or carrier IP address (for instances
       that are in subnets in Wavelength Zones) with an instance or a  network
       interface.  Before you can use an Elastic IP address, you must allocate
       it to your account.

       If the Elastic IP address is already associated with  a  different  in-
       stance,  it is disassociated from that instance and associated with the
       specified instance. If you associate an Elastic IP address with an  in-
       stance that has an existing Elastic IP address, the existing address is
       disassociated from the instance, but remains allocated to your account.

       [Subnets in Wavelength Zones] You can associate an IP address from  the
       telecommunication carrier to the instance or network interface.

       You  cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an interface in a dif-
       ferent network border group.

       WARNING:
          This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the  operation  more
          than  once,  Amazon  EC2  doesn't  return  an  error, and you may be
          charged for each time the Elastic IP address is remapped to the same
          instance. For more information, see the Elastic IP Addresses section
          of Amazon EC2 Pricing .

OPTIONS
       --allocation-id (string)
          The allocation ID. This is required.

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance. The instance must have exactly one  attached
          network  interface.  You  can  specify either the instance ID or the
          network interface ID, but not both.

       --public-ip (string)
          Deprecated.

       --allow-reassociation | --no-allow-reassociation (boolean)
          Reassociation is automatic, but you can specify false to ensure  the
          operation fails if the Elastic IP address is already associated with
          another resource.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --network-interface-id (string)
          The  ID  of the network interface. If the instance has more than one
          network interface, you must specify a network interface ID.

          You can specify either the instance ID or the network interface  ID,
          but not both.

       --private-ip-address (string)
          The  primary  or  secondary private IP address to associate with the
          Elastic IP address. If no private IP address is specified, the Elas-
          tic IP address is associated with the primary private IP address.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
