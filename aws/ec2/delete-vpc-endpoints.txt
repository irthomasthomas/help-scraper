DELETE-VPC-ENDPOINTS()                                  DELETE-VPC-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       delete-vpc-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  one or more specified VPC endpoints. You can delete any of the
       following types of VPC endpoints.

       o Gateway endpoint,

       o Gateway Load Balancer endpoint,

       o Interface endpoint

       The following rules apply when you delete a VPC endpoint:

       o When you delete a gateway endpoint, we delete the endpoint routes  in
         the route tables that are associated with the endpoint.

       o When  you delete a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, we delete the end-
         point network interfaces.  You can only delete Gateway Load  Balancer
         endpoints  when  the routes that are associated with the endpoint are
         deleted.

       o When you delete an interface endpoint, we delete the endpoint network
         interfaces.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --vpc-endpoint-ids (list)
          One or more VPC endpoint IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete an endpoint

       This example deletes endpoints vpce-aa22bb33 and vpce-1a2b3c4d. If  the
       command is partially successful or unsuccessful, a list of unsuccessful
       items is returned. If the command succeeds, the returned list is empty.

       Command:

          aws ec2 delete-vpc-endpoints --vpc-endpoint-ids vpce-aa22bb33 vpce-1a2b3c4d

       Output:

          {
            "Unsuccessful": []
          }

OUTPUT
       Unsuccessful -> (list)
          Information about the  VPC  endpoints  that  were  not  successfully
          deleted.

          (structure)
              Information  about items that were not successfully processed in
              a batch call.

              Error -> (structure)
                 Information about the error.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The error code.

                 Message -> (string)
                     The error message accompanying the error code.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource.
