ASSOCIATE-ENCLAVE-CERTIFICATE-IAM-ROLEASSOCIATE-ENCLAVE-CERTIFICATE-IAM-ROLE()



NAME
       associate-enclave-certificate-iam-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  an  Identity  and Access Management (IAM) role with an Cer-
       tificate Manager (ACM) certificate. This enables the certificate to  be
       used  by  the ACM for Nitro Enclaves application inside an enclave. For
       more information, see Certificate Manager for  Nitro  Enclaves  in  the
       Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves User Guide .

       When  the IAM role is associated with the ACM certificate, the certifi-
       cate, certificate chain, and encrypted private key  are  placed  in  an
       Amazon  S3  location  that only the associated IAM role can access. The
       private key of the certificate is encrypted with an Amazon Web Services
       managed key that has an attached attestation-based key policy.

       To  enable  the IAM role to access the Amazon S3 object, you must grant
       it permission to call s3:GetObject on the Amazon S3 bucket returned  by
       the  command.  To  enable  the IAM role to access the KMS key, you must
       grant it permission to call kms:Decrypt on the KMS key returned by  the
       command.  For more information, see Grant the role permission to access
       the certificate and encryption key in the Amazon Web Services Nitro En-
       claves User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          The ARN of the ACM certificate with which to associate the IAM role.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the IAM role to associate with the ACM certificate. You
          can associate up to 16 IAM roles with an ACM certificate.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       CertificateS3BucketName -> (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to which the  certificate  was  up-
          loaded.

       CertificateS3ObjectKey -> (string)
          The  Amazon  S3 object key where the certificate, certificate chain,
          and encrypted private key bundle are stored. The object key is  for-
          matted as follows: role_arn /certificate_arn .

       EncryptionKmsKeyId -> (string)
          The  ID  of  the KMS key used to encrypt the private key of the cer-
          tificate.
