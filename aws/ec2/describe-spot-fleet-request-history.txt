NAME
       describe-spot-fleet-request-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  events  for the specified Spot Fleet request during the
       specified time.

       Spot Fleet events are delayed by up to 30 seconds before  they  can  be
       described.  This  ensures that you can query by the last evaluated time
       and not miss a recorded event. Spot Fleet events are available  for  48
       hours.

       For more information, see Monitor fleet events using Amazon EventBridge
       in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --spot-fleet-request-id (string)
          The ID of the Spot Fleet request.

       --event-type (string)
          The  type  of  events  to  describe.  By default, all events are de-
          scribed.

          Possible values:

          o instanceChange

          o fleetRequestChange

          o error

          o information

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The starting date and time for the events, in UTC format (for  exam-
          ple, YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z).

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  to  include  in  another request to get the next page of
          items. This value is null when there are no more items to return.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return for this request. To  get  the
          next  page of items, make another request with the token returned in
          the output. For more information, see Pagination .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe Spot fleet history

       This  example  command returns the history for the specified Spot fleet
       starting at the specified time.

                        fleetRequestChange events:

                     o active  -  The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request has been
                       validated and Amazon EC2 is attempting to maintain  the
                       target number of running instances.

                     o deleted  (EC2 Fleet) / cancelled (Spot Fleet) - The EC2
                       Fleet is deleted or the Spot Fleet request is  canceled
                       and  has  no  running  instances. The EC2 Fleet or Spot
                       Fleet will be deleted two days after its instances  are
                       terminated.

                       quest  is  canceled  and does not launch additional in-
                       stances. Its existing instances continue to  run  until
                       they are interrupted or terminated. The request remains
                       in this state until all instances  are  interrupted  or
                       terminated.

                     o deleted_terminating (EC2 Fleet) / cancelled_terminating
                       (Spot Fleet) - The EC2 Fleet is  deleted  or  the  Spot
                       Fleet  request is canceled and its instances are termi-
                       nating. The request remains in this state until all in-
                       stances are terminated.

                     o expired  -  The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request has ex-
                       pired. If the request  was  created  with  TerminateIn-
                       stancesWithExpiration   set,  a  subsequent  terminated
                       event indicates that the instances are terminated.

                     o modify_in_progress - The EC2 Fleet or  Spot  Fleet  re-
                       quest  is  being  modified. The request remains in this
                       state until the modification is fully processed.

                     o modify_succeeded - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet  request
                       was modified.

                     o submitted  - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is be-
                       ing evaluated and Amazon EC2 is preparing to launch the
                       target number of instances.

                     o progress  -  The  EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is in
                       the process of being fulfilled.
                        instanceChange events:

                     o launched - A new instance was launched.

                     o terminated - An instance was terminated by the user.

                     o termination_notified - An instance termination  notifi-
                       cation  was sent when a Spot Instance was terminated by
                       Amazon EC2 during scale-down, when the target  capacity
                       of  the  fleet  was  modified down, for example, from a
                       target capacity of 4 to a target capacity of 3.

                       fication  is  not  valid  because  it is below the Spot
                       price (all  the  launch  specifications  have  produced
                       launchSpecUnusable   events).  A  launch  specification
                       might become valid if the Spot price changes.

                     o launchSpecTemporarilyBlacklisted - The configuration is
                       not valid and several attempts to launch instances have

                       ter  instances with load balancers failed. For more in-
                       formation, see the description of the event.

                 InstanceId -> (string)
                     The ID of the instance.  This  information  is  available
                     only for instanceChange events.

          The  last  date and time for the events, in UTC format (for example,
          YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z). All records up to this time were  re-
          trieved.

          If  nextToken indicates that there are more items, this value is not
          present.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to include in another request to  get  the  next  page  of
          items. This value is null when there are no more items to return.

       SpotFleetRequestId -> (string)
          The ID of the Spot Fleet request.

       StartTime -> (timestamp)
