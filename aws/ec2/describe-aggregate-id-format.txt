NAME
       describe-aggregate-id-format -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  longer  ID  format settings for all resource types in a
       specific Region. This request is useful for performing a quick audit to
       determine  whether  a  specific Region is fully opted in for longer IDs
       (17-character IDs).

       This request only returns information about resource types that support
       longer IDs.

       The  following  resource  types  support  longer  IDs: bundle | conver-
       sion-task | customer-gateway | dhcp-options |  elastic-ip-allocation  |
       elastic-ip-association | export-task | flow-log | image | import-task |
       instance | internet-gateway | network-acl |  network-acl-association  |
       network-interface | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list | reser-
       vation | route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snap-
       shot  |  subnet  |  subnet-cidr-block-association  |  volume  |  vpc  |
       vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint  |  vpc-peering-connection  |
       vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  describe  the longer ID format settings for all resource types in a
       Region

       The following describe-aggregate-id-format example describes the  over-
       all  long  ID  format status for the current Region. The Deadline value
       indicates that the deadlines for these resources to permanently  switch
       from  the short ID format to the long ID format expired. The UseLongId-
       sAggregated value indicates that all IAM users and IAM roles  are  con-
       figured to use long ID format for all resource types.

          aws ec2 describe-aggregate-id-format

       Output:

          {
              "UseLongIdsAggregated": true,
              "Statuses": [
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2018-08-13T02:00:00.000Z",
                      "Resource": "network-interface-attachment",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  },
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2016-12-13T02:00:00.000Z",
                      "Resource": "instance",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  },
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2018-08-13T02:00:00.000Z",
                      "Resource": "elastic-ip-association",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  },
                  ...
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       UseLongIdsAggregated -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether all resource types in the Region are configured to
          use longer IDs. This value is only true if all users are  configured
          to use longer IDs for all resources types in the Region.

       Statuses -> (list)
          Information about each resource's ID format.

          (structure)
              Describes the ID format for a resource.

              Deadline -> (timestamp)
                 The date in UTC at which you are permanently switched over to
                 using longer IDs. If a deadline is not yet available for this
                 resource type, this field is not returned.

              Resource -> (string)
                 The type of resource.

              UseLongIds -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  longer IDs (17-character IDs) are enabled
                 for the resource.
