DISASSOCIATE-IPAM-RESOURCE-DISCOVERY()  DISASSOCIATE-IPAM-RESOURCE-DISCOVERY()



NAME
       disassociate-ipam-resource-discovery -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  a resource discovery from an Amazon VPC IPAM. A resource
       discovery is an IPAM component that enables IPAM to manage and  monitor
       resources that belong to the owning account.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-resource-discovery-association-id (string)
          A resource discovery association ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disassociate a resource discovery from an IPAM

       In  this  example, you are an IPAM delegated admin account and you want
       to disassociate an IPAM resource discovery from your IPAM. You ran  the
       describe   command  and  noticed  that  the  "ResourceDiscoveryStatus":
       "not-found" and you want to disassociate it from your IPAM to make room
       for other associations.

       The  following  disassociate-ipam-resource-discovery example disassoci-
       ates an IPAM resource discovery in your AWS account.

          aws ec2 disassociate-ipam-resource-discovery \
              --ipam-resource-discovery-association-id ipam-res-disco-assoc-04382a6346357cf82 \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociation": {
                  "OwnerId": "320805250157",
                  "IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociationId": "ipam-res-disco-assoc-04382a6346357cf82",
                  "IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociationArn":             "arn:aws:ec2::320805250157:ipam-resource-discovery-association/ipam-res-disco-assoc-04382a6346357cf82",
                  "IpamResourceDiscoveryId": "ipam-res-disco-0365d2977fc1672fe",
                  "IpamId": "ipam-005f921c17ebd5107",
                  "IpamArn": "arn:aws:ec2::320805250157:ipam/ipam-005f921c17ebd5107",
                  "IpamRegion": "us-east-1",
                  "IsDefault": false,
                  "ResourceDiscoveryStatus": "not-found",
                  "State": "disassociate-in-progress"
              }
          }

              owner.

              The resource discovery association ID.

          IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociationArn -> (string)
              The resource discovery association Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          IpamResourceDiscoveryId -> (string)
              The resource discovery ID.

              The IPAM home Region.

          IsDefault -> (boolean)
              Defines if the resource discovery is the default. When you  cre-
              ate  an  IPAM,  a default resource discovery is created for your
              IPAM and it's associated with your IPAM.

          ResourceDiscoveryStatus -> (string)
              The resource discovery status.

              o active - Connection or permissions required to  read  the  re-
                sults of the resource discovery are intact.

              o not-found - Connection or permissions required to read the re-
                sults of the resource discovery are broken. This may happen if
                the  owner  of  the  resource  discovery stopped sharing it or
                deleted the resource discovery. Verify the resource  discovery
                still exists and the Amazon Web Services RAM resource share is
                still intact.

          State -> (string)
              The lifecycle state of the association  when  you  associate  or
              disassociate a resource discovery.

              o associate-in-progress  -  Resource  discovery is being associ-
                ated.

                plete.

              o associate-failed - Resource discovery association has failed.

              o disassociate-in-progress  - Resource discovery is being disas-
                sociated.

              o disassociate-complete - Resource discovery  disassociation  is
                complete.

              o disassociate-failed  -  Resource  discovery disassociation has
                failed.

              o isolate-in-progress - Amazon Web Services account that created
                the  resource  discovery  association has been removed and the
                resource discovery associatation is being isolated.

              o isolate-complete - Resource discovery isolation is complete..

              o restore-in-progress - Resource discovery is being restored.

          Tags -> (list)
              A tag is a label that you assign to an Amazon Web  Services  re-
              source.  Each  tag  consists of a key and an optional value. You
              can use tags to search and filter your resources or  track  your
              Amazon Web Services costs.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  keys  are  case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 127 Unicode characters.  May  not  begin  with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  values are case-sensitive and accept a
