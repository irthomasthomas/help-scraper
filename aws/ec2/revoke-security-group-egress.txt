REVOKE-SECURITY-GROUP-EGRESS()                  REVOKE-SECURITY-GROUP-EGRESS()



NAME
       revoke-security-group-egress -

DESCRIPTION
       [VPC  only]  Removes the specified outbound (egress) rules from a secu-
       rity group for EC2-VPC. This action does not apply to  security  groups
       for use in EC2-Classic.

       You  can  specify  rules  using  either rule IDs or security group rule
       properties. If you use rule properties, the  values  that  you  specify
       (for  example,  ports)  must  match the existing rule's values exactly.
       Each rule has a protocol, from and  to  ports,  and  destination  (CIDR
       range,  security group, or prefix list). For the TCP and UDP protocols,
       you must also specify the destination port or range of ports.  For  the
       ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. If the se-
       curity group rule has a description, you do not need to specify the de-
       scription to revoke the rule.

       [Default  VPC]  If  the  values  you  specify do not match the existing
       rule's values, no error is returned, and the output describes the secu-
       rity group rules that were not revoked.

       Amazon  Web Services recommends that you describe the security group to
       verify that the rules were removed.

       Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security  group  as
       quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --group-id (string)
          The ID of the security group.

       --ip-permissions (list)
          The sets of IP permissions. You can't specify a destination security
          group and a CIDR IP address range in the same set of permissions.

          (structure)
              Describes a set of permissions for a security group rule.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 The  start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an
                 ICMP/ICMPv6  type  number.  A  value  of  -1  indicates   all
                 ICMP/ICMPv6  types. If you specify all ICMP/ICMPv6 types, you
                 must specify all codes.

              IpProtocol -> (string)
                 The IP protocol name (tcp , udp , icmp , icmpv6 )  or  number
                 (see Protocol Numbers ).

                 [VPC  only] Use -1 to specify all protocols. When authorizing
                 security group rules, specifying  -1  or  a  protocol  number
                 other than tcp , udp , icmp , or icmpv6 allows traffic on all
                 ports, regardless of any port range you specify.  For  tcp  ,
                 udp  , and icmp , you must specify a port range. For icmpv6 ,
                 the port range is optional; if you omit the port range, traf-
                 fic for all types and codes is allowed.

       --protocol (string)
          The IP protocol: tcp | udp | icmp

          (VPC only) Use all to specify all protocols.

          If  this  argument is provided without also providing the port argu-
          ment, then it will be applied to all ports for the specified  proto-
          col.

       --port (string)
          For  TCP  or UDP: The range of ports to allow. A single integer or a
          range (min-max ).

          For ICMP: A single integer or a range (type-code ) representing  the
          ICMP  type  number and the ICMP code number respectively. A value of
          -1 indicates all ICMP codes for all ICMP types. A value of  -1  just
          for type indicates all ICMP codes for the specified ICMP type.

       --cidr (string)
          The CIDR IP range.

       --source-group (string)
          The name or ID of the source security group.

       --group-owner (string)
          The  AWS  account  ID that owns the source security group. Cannot be
          used when specifying a CIDR IP address.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To remove the rule that allows outbound traffic  to  a  spe-
       cific address range

       The  following revoke-security-group-egress example command removes the
       rule that grants access to the specified address ranges on TCP port 80.

          aws ec2 revoke-security-group-egress \
              --group-id sg-026c12253ce15eff7 \
              --ip-permissions [{IpProtocol=tcp,FromPort=80,ToPort=80,IpRanges=[{CidrIp=10.0.0.0/16}]

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Security groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 2: To remove the rule that allows outbound traffic  to  a  spe-
       cific security group

       The  following revoke-security-group-egress example command removes the
       rule that grants access to the specified security group on TCP port 80.

          aws ec2 revoke-security-group-egress \
              --group-id sg-026c12253ce15eff7 \
              --ip-permissions '[{"IpProtocol": "tcp", "FromPort": 443, "ToPort": 443,"UserIdGroupPairs": [{"GroupId": "sg-06df23a01ff2df86d"}]}]'

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Security groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

                 (see Protocol Numbers ).

                 [VPC only] Use -1 to specify all protocols. When  authorizing
                 security  group  rules,  specifying  -1  or a protocol number
                 other than tcp , udp , icmp , or icmpv6 allows traffic on all
                 ports,  regardless  of  any port range you specify. For tcp ,
                 udp , and icmp , you must specify a port range. For icmpv6  ,
                 the port range is optional; if you omit the port range, traf-
                 fic for all types and codes is allowed.
