NAME
       cancel-capacity-reservation-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels  one or more Capacity Reservation Fleets. When you cancel a Ca-
       pacity Reservation Fleet, the following happens:

       o The Capacity Reservation Fleet's status changes to cancelled .

       o The individual Capacity Reservations in the Fleet are cancelled.  In-
         stances  running  in  the  Capacity  Reservations at the time of can-
         celling the Fleet continue to run in shared capacity.

       o The Fleet stops creating new Capacity Reservations.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-capacity-reservation-fleets
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --capacity-reservation-fleet-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --capacity-reservation-fleet-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Capacity Reservation Fleets to cancel.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To cancel a Capacity Reservation Fleet

       The following cancel-capacity-reservation-fleets  example  cancels  the
       specified Capacity Reservation Fleet and the capacity it reserves. When
       you cancel a Fleet, its status changes to  cancelled,  and  it  can  no
       longer create new Capacity Reservations. Additionally, all of the indi-
       vidual Capacity Reservations in the Fleet are cancelled,  and  the  in-
       stances  that were previously running in the reserved capacity continue
       to run normally in shared capacity.
