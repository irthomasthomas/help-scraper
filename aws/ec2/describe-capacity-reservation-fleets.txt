DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more Capacity Reservation Fleets.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-capacity-reservation-fleets is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: CapacityReservationFleets

OPTIONS
       --capacity-reservation-fleet-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Capacity Reservation Fleets to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o state - The state of the Fleet (submitted | modifying |  active  |
            partially_fulfilled  | expiring | expired | cancelling | cancelled
            | failed ).

          o instance-match-criteria - The instance matching criteria  for  the
            Fleet. Only open is supported.

          o tenancy - The tenancy of the Fleet (default | dedicated ).

          o allocation-strategy  -  The allocation strategy used by the Fleet.
            Only prioritized is supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 o submitted - The Capacity Reservation Fleet request has been
                   submitted and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is preparing  to
                   create the Capacity Reservations.

                 o modifying  -  The Capacity Reservation Fleet is being modi-
                   fied. The Fleet remains in this state until  the  modifica-
                   tion is complete.

                 o active  -  The Capacity Reservation Fleet has fulfilled its
                   total target capacity and it is attempting to maintain this
                   capacity. The Fleet remains in this state until it is modi-
                   fied or deleted.

                 o partially_fulfilled - The Capacity  Reservation  Fleet  has
                   partially fulfilled its total target capacity. There is in-
                   sufficient Amazon EC2 to fulfill the total target capacity.
                   The Fleet is attempting to asynchronously fulfill its total
                   target capacity.

                 o expiring - The Capacity Reservation Fleet has reach its end
                   date  and  it is in the process of expiring. One or more of
                   its Capacity reservations might still be active.

                 o expired - The Capacity Reservation Fleet has reach its  end
                   date.  The Fleet and its Capacity Reservations are expired.
                   The Fleet can't create new Capacity Reservations.

                 o cancelling - The  Capacity  Reservation  Fleet  is  in  the
                   process  of  being  cancelled.  One or more of its Capacity
                   reservations might still be active.

                 o cancelled - The Capacity Reservation Fleet has  been  manu-
                   ally cancelled. The Fleet and its Capacity Reservations are
                   cancelled and the Fleet can't create new Capacity  Reserva-
                   tions.

                 o failed  -  The Capacity Reservation Fleet failed to reserve
                   capacity for the specified instance types.

              TotalTargetCapacity -> (integer)
                 The total number of capacity units  for  which  the  Capacity
                 Reservation  Fleet  reserves  capacity. For more information,
                 see Total target capacity in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

              TotalFulfilledCapacity -> (double)
                 The capacity units that have been fulfilled.

              Tenancy -> (string)
                 The tenancy of the Capacity Reservation Fleet. Tenancies  in-
                 clude:

                 o default  -  The  Capacity  Reservation  Fleet is created on
                   hardware that is shared with other Amazon Web Services  ac-
                   counts.

                 o dedicated  -  The  Capacity Reservation Fleet is created on
                   single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single Amazon
                   Web Services account.

              EndDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation Fleet ex-
                 pires.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation Fleet was
                 created.

              InstanceMatchCriteria -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  type  of  instance launches that the Capacity
                 Reservation Fleet accepts. All Capacity Reservations  in  the
                 Fleet inherit this instance matching criteria.

                 Currently,  Capacity Reservation Fleets support open instance
                 matching criteria only. This means that instances  that  have
                 matching  attributes (instance type, platform, and Availabil-
                 ity Zone) run in the Capacity Reservations automatically. In-
                 stances  do not need to explicitly target a Capacity Reserva-
                 tion Fleet to use its reserved capacity.

              AllocationStrategy -> (string)
                 The strategy used by the Capacity Reservation Fleet to deter-
                 mine  which  of the specified instance types to use. For more
                 information, see For more information, see Allocation  strat-
                 egy in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                        The  ID of the Availability Zone in which the Capacity
                        Reservation reserves capacity.

                     InstanceType -> (string)
                        The instance type for which the  Capacity  Reservation
                        reserves capacity.

                        tion reserves capacity.

                     TotalInstanceCount -> (integer)
                        The  total  number of instances for which the Capacity
                        Reservation reserves capacity.

                     FulfilledCapacity -> (double)
