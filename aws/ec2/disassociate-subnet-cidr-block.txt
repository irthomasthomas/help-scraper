NAME
       disassociate-subnet-cidr-block -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates a CIDR block from a subnet. Currently, you can disassoci-
       ate an IPv6 CIDR block only. You must detach or delete all gateways and
       resources that are associated with the CIDR block before you can disas-
       sociate it.

OPTIONS
       --association-id (string)
          The association ID for the CIDR block.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disassociate an IPv6 CIDR block from a subnet

       This example disassociates an IPv6 CIDR block from a subnet  using  the
       association ID for the CIDR block.

       Command:

          aws ec2 disassociate-subnet-cidr-block --association-id subnet-cidr-assoc-3aa54053

       Output:

          {
            "SubnetId": "subnet-5f46ec3b",
            "Ipv6CidrBlockAssociation": {
                "Ipv6CidrBlock": "2001:db8:1234:1a00::/64",
                "AssociationId": "subnet-cidr-assoc-3aa54053",
                "Ipv6CidrBlockState": {
                    "State": "disassociating"
                }
            }
          }

OUTPUT
       Ipv6CidrBlockAssociation -> (structure)
          Information about the IPv6 CIDR block association.

          AssociationId -> (string)
              The ID of the association.

          Ipv6CidrBlock -> (string)
              The IPv6 CIDR block.

          Ipv6CidrBlockState -> (structure)
              The state of the CIDR block.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of a CIDR block.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 A message about the status of the CIDR block, if applicable.

          Ipv6AddressAttribute -> (string)
              Public  IPv6 addresses are those advertised on the internet from
              Amazon Web Services. Private IP addresses are not and cannot  be
              advertised on the internet from Amazon Web Services.

          IpSource -> (string)
              The  source that allocated the IP address space. byoip or amazon
              indicates public IP address space allocated by Amazon  or  space
              that you have allocated with Bring your own IP (BYOIP). none in-
              dicates private space.

       SubnetId -> (string)
          The ID of the subnet.
