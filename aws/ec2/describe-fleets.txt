NAME
       describe-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified EC2 Fleets or all of your EC2 Fleets.

       For more information, see Monitor your EC2 Fleet in the Amazon EC2 User
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-fleets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Fleets

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --fleet-ids (list)
          The IDs of the EC2 Fleets.

          NOTE:
              If a fleet is of type instant , you must specify the  fleet  ID,
              otherwise it does not appear in the response.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o activity-status  -  The  progress of the EC2 Fleet ( error | pend-
            ing-fulfillment | pending-termination | fulfilled ).

          o excess-capacity-termination-policy - Indicates whether  to  termi-
            nate  running  instances if the target capacity is decreased below
            the current EC2 Fleet size (true | false ).

          o fleet-state - The state of the EC2 Fleet  (submitted  |  active  |
            deleted | failed | deleted-running | deleted-terminating | modify-
            ing ).

          o replace-unhealthy-instances - Indicates whether EC2  Fleet  should
            replace unhealthy instances (true | false ).

          o type - The type of request (instant | request | maintain ).

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 tus is error . After all requests are placed, the  status  is
                 pending_fulfillment  .  If the size of the EC2 Fleet is equal
                 to or greater than its target capacity, the  status  is  ful-
                 filled  . If the size of the EC2 Fleet is decreased, the sta-
                 tus is pending_termination while instances are terminating.

                 the  idempotency  of  the  request. For more information, see
                 Ensuring idempotency .

                 Constraints: Maximum 64 ASCII characters

              ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy -> (string)
                 Indicates whether running instances should be  terminated  if
                 the  target  capacity of the EC2 Fleet is decreased below the
                 current size of the EC2 Fleet.

                 Supported only for fleets of type maintain .

              FulfilledCapacity -> (double)
                 The number of units fulfilled by this request compared to the
                 set target capacity.

              FulfilledOnDemandCapacity -> (double)
                 The number of units fulfilled by this request compared to the

                     LaunchTemplateSpecification -> (structure)
                        The launch template.

                        LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                            The ID of the launch template.

                            You  must  specify  the  LaunchTemplateId  or  the
                            LaunchTemplateName , but not both.

                        LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                            The name of the launch template.

                            You  must  specify  the  LaunchTemplateName or the
                            LaunchTemplateId , but not both.

                        Version -> (string)

                            If the value is $Latest , Amazon EC2 uses the lat-
                            est version of the launch template.

                            If the value is $Default , Amazon EC2 uses the de-
                            fault version of the launch template.

                     Overrides -> (list)
                        Any parameters that you specify override the same  pa-
                        rameters in the launch template.

                        (structure)
                            Describes overrides for a launch template.

                               The instance type.
                                   mac1.metal  is  not  supported  as a launch
                                   template override.

                               NOTE:
                                   If you specify  InstanceType  ,  you  can't
                                   specify InstanceRequirements .

                            MaxPrice -> (string)
                               The  maximum  price  per unit hour that you are
                               willing to pay for a Spot Instance. We  do  not
                               recommend  using  this parameter because it can
                               lead to increased interruptions. If you do  not
                               specify  this  parameter, you will pay the cur-
                               rent Spot price.

                               WARNING:
                                   If you specify a maximum  price,  your  in-
                                   stances will be interrupted more frequently
                                   than if you do not specify this parameter.

                            SubnetId -> (string)
                               The ID of the subnet in which to launch the in-
                               stances.

                            AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                               The  Availability  Zone  in which to launch the
                               instances.

                            WeightedCapacity -> (double)
                               The number of units provided by  the  specified
                               instance type.

                            Priority -> (double)
                               The  priority for the launch template override.
                               The highest priority is launched first.

                               If the On-Demand AllocationStrategy is  set  to
                               prioritized , EC2 Fleet uses priority to deter-
                               mine which  launch  template  override  to  use
                               first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

                               If the Spot AllocationStrategy is set to capac-
                               ity-optimized-prioritized , EC2 Fleet uses pri-
                               ority on a best-effort basis to determine which
                               launch template override to use  in  fulfilling
                               Spot   capacity,  but  optimizes  for  capacity
                               first.

                               Valid values are whole numbers starting at 0  .
                               The  lower the number, the higher the priority.
                               If no number is set, the override has the  low-
                               est priority. You can set the same priority for
                               different launch template overrides.

                            Placement -> (structure)

                                   The  name  of  the placement group that the
                                   instance is in.

                            InstanceRequirements -> (structure)
                               The attributes for the instance types. When you
                               specify  instance  attributes,  Amazon EC2 will
                               identify instance types with those attributes.

                               NOTE:
                                   If you specify InstanceRequirements  ,  you
                                   can't specify InstanceType .

                                   Min -> (integer)
                                      The minimum amount of memory, in MiB. If
                                      this parameter is not  specified,  there
                                      is no minimum limit.

                                   Max -> (integer)
                                      The maximum amount of memory, in MiB. If
                                      this parameter is not  specified,  there
                                      is no maximum limit.

                               CpuManufacturers -> (list)
                                   The CPU manufacturers to include.

                                     vices CPUs, specify amazon-web-services .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't confuse the CPU manufacturer  with
                                      the  CPU architecture. Instances will be
                                      launched with a compatible CPU architec-
                                      ture  based  on the Amazon Machine Image
                                      (AMI) that you specify  in  your  launch
                                      template.

                                   Default: Any manufacturer

                               MemoryGiBPerVCpu -> (structure)
                                   The  minimum  and  maximum amount of memory
                                   per vCPU, in GiB.

                                   Default: No minimum or maximum limits

                                   Min -> (double)
                                      The minimum amount of memory  per  vCPU,
                                      in  GiB. If this parameter is not speci-
                                      fied, there is no minimum limit.

                                   Max -> (double)
                                      The maximum amount of memory  per  vCPU,
                                      in  GiB. If this parameter is not speci-
                                      fied, there is no maximum limit.

                               ExcludedInstanceTypes -> (list)
                                   The instance types to exclude.

                                   You can use strings with one or  more  wild
                                   cards,  represented by an asterisk (* ), to
                                   exclude an instance type, size, or  genera-
                                   tion.    The    following   are   examples:
                                   m5.8xlarge , c5*.* , m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                                   For example, if you specify c5* ,Amazon EC2
                                   will exclude the entire C5 instance family,
                                   which includes all  C5a  and  C5n  instance
                                   types.  If  you  specify m5a.* , Amazon EC2
                                   will exclude all the  M5a  instance  types,
                                   but not the M5n instance types.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If  you  specify ExcludedInstanceTypes ,
                                      you can't specify AllowedInstanceTypes .

                                   Default: No excluded instance types

                                   (string)

                               InstanceGenerations -> (list)
                                   Indicates whether current or previous  gen-
                                   eration  instance  types  are included. The
                                   current generation instance types are  rec-
                                   ommended  for  use.  Current generation in-
                                   stance types are typically the  latest  two

                                   specified attributes. When Amazon  EC2  se-
                                   lects  instance types with your attributes,
                                   it excludes  instance  types  priced  above
                                   your threshold.

                                   The  parameter  accepts  an  integer, which
                                   Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage.

                                   To turn off  price  protection,  specify  a
                                   high value, such as 999999 .

                                   This   parameter   is   not  supported  for

                 acteristic that is important to  your  application  workload,
                 such  as  vCPUs, memory, or I/O. If the request type is main-
                 tain , you can specify a target capacity of 0 and add  capac-
                 ity later.

                 TotalTargetCapacity -> (integer)
                     The  number of units to request, filled using DefaultTar-

                 OnDemandTargetCapacity -> (integer)
                     The number of On-Demand units to request. If you  specify
                     a  target  capacity  for Spot units, you cannot specify a
                     target capacity for On-Demand units.

                 SpotTargetCapacity -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of Spot units to launch. If you  spec-
                     ify  a  target  capacity  for On-Demand units, you cannot
                     specify a target capacity for Spot units.

                 DefaultTargetCapacityType -> (string)
                     The default TotalTargetCapacity , which is either Spot or
                     On-Demand .

                 TargetCapacityUnitType -> (string)
                     The  unit for the target capacity. TargetCapacityUnitType
                     can only be specified when InstanceRequirements is speci-
                     fied.

                     Default: units (translates to number of instances)

              TerminateInstancesWithExpiration -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether running instances should be terminated when
                 the EC2 Fleet expires.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of request. Indicates whether the EC2 Fleet only re-
                 quests  the target capacity, or also attempts to maintain it.
                 If you request a certain  target  capacity,  EC2  Fleet  only
                 places  the required requests; it does not attempt to replen-
                 ish instances if capacity is diminished, and it does not sub-
                 mit requests in alternative capacity pools if capacity is un-
                 available. To maintain a certain target capacity,  EC2  Fleet
                 places the required requests to meet this target capacity. It
                 also  automatically  replenishes  any  interrupted  Spot  In-
                 stances. Default: maintain .

              ValidFrom -> (timestamp)
                 The  start  date  and time of the request, in UTC format (for
                 example, YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z).  The  default  is  to
                 start fulfilling the request immediately.

              ValidUntil -> (timestamp)
                 The  end date and time of the request, in UTC format (for ex-
                 ample, YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z). At this point,  no  new
                 instance  requests are placed or able to fulfill the request.
                 The default end date is 7 days from the current date.

              ReplaceUnhealthyInstances -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether EC2 Fleet should replace unhealthy Spot In-
                 stances.  Supported  only  for  fleets of type maintain . For
                 more information, see EC2 Fleet health checks in  the  Amazon
                 EC2 User Guide .

              SpotOptions -> (structure)
                 The configuration of Spot Instances in an EC2 Fleet.

                 AllocationStrategy -> (string)
                     The  strategy  that determines how to allocate the target
                     Spot Instance capacity across  the  Spot  Instance  pools
                     specified by the EC2 Fleet launch configuration. For more
                     information, see Allocation strategies for Spot Instances
                     in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .
                        price-capacity-optimized (recommended)

                     EC2  Fleet identifies the pools with the highest capacity
                     availability for the number of instances that are launch-
                     ing.  This means that we will request Spot Instances from
                     the pools that we believe have the lowest chance  of  in-
                     terruption in the near term. EC2 Fleet then requests Spot
                     Instances from the lowest priced of these pools.
                        capacity-optimized

                     EC2 Fleet identifies the pools with the highest  capacity
                     availability for the number of instances that are launch-
                     ing. This means that we will request Spot Instances  from
                     the  pools  that we believe have the lowest chance of in-
                     terruption in the near term.  To  give  certain  instance
                     types  a  higher  chance  of  launching first, use capac-
                     ity-optimized-prioritized . Set a priority for  each  in-
                     stance   type   by   using  the  Priority  parameter  for
                     LaunchTemplateOverrides . You can assign the same  prior-
                     ity to different LaunchTemplateOverrides . EC2 implements
                     the priorities on a best-effort basis, but optimizes  for
                     capacity  first.  capacity-optimized-prioritized  is sup-
                     ported only if your EC2 Fleet  uses  a  launch  template.
                     Note  that  if the On-Demand AllocationStrategy is set to
                     prioritized , the same priority is applied when  fulfill-
                     ing On-Demand capacity.
                        diversified

                     EC2  Fleet  requests  instances  from all of the Spot In-
                     stance pools that you specify.
                        lowest-price

                     EC2 Fleet requests instances from the lowest priced  Spot
                     Instance  pool that has available capacity. If the lowest
                     priced pool doesn't have available capacity, the Spot In-
                     stances  come  from  the next lowest priced pool that has
                     available capacity. If a pool runs out of capacity before
                     fulfilling your desired capacity, EC2 Fleet will continue
                     to fulfill your request by drawing from the  next  lowest
                     priced pool. To ensure that your desired capacity is met,
                     you might receive Spot Instances from several pools.  Be-
                     cause this strategy only considers instance price and not
                     capacity availability, it might lead to high interruption
                     rates.

                     Default: lowest-price

                 MaintenanceStrategies -> (structure)
                     The  strategies  for managing your workloads on your Spot
                     Instances that will be interrupted.  Currently  only  the
                     capacity rebalance strategy is available.

                     CapacityRebalance -> (structure)
                        The  strategy  to  use  when Amazon EC2 emits a signal
                        that your Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of  be-
                        ing interrupted.

                        ReplacementStrategy -> (string)
                            The  replacement  strategy  to use. Only available
                            for fleets of type maintain .
                               launch - EC2 Fleet launches a  new  replacement
                               Spot  Instance when a rebalance notification is
                               emitted for an existing Spot  Instance  in  the
                               fleet.  EC2  Fleet  does  not terminate the in-
                               stances that receive a rebalance  notification.
                               You can terminate the old instances, or you can
                               leave them running. You are charged for all in-
                               stances while they are running.

                               launch-before-terminate  - EC2 Fleet launches a
                               new replacement Spot Instance when a  rebalance
                               notification  is  emitted  for an existing Spot
                               Instance in the fleet, and then, after a  delay
                               that you specify (in TerminationDelay ), termi-
                               nates the instances that received  a  rebalance
                               notification.

                        TerminationDelay -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of  time (in seconds) that Amazon EC2
                            waits before terminating the old Spot Instance af-
                            ter launching a new replacement Spot Instance.

                            Required   when   ReplacementStrategy  is  set  to
                            launch-before-terminate .

                            Not  valid  when  ReplacementStrategy  is  set  to
                            launch .

                            Valid  values: Minimum value of 120 seconds. Maxi-
                            mum value of 7200 seconds.

                 InstanceInterruptionBehavior -> (string)
                     The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted.

                     Default: terminate

                 InstancePoolsToUseCount -> (integer)
                     The number of Spot pools across which  to  allocate  your
                     target  Spot  capacity.  Supported  only when Allocation-
                     Strategy is set to lowest-price . EC2 Fleet  selects  the
                     cheapest Spot pools and evenly allocates your target Spot
                     capacity across the number of Spot pools that  you  spec-
                     ify.

                     Note  that EC2 Fleet attempts to draw Spot Instances from
                     the number of pools that you specify on a best effort ba-
                     sis.  If a pool runs out of Spot capacity before fulfill-
                     ing your target capacity, EC2 Fleet will continue to ful-
                     fill your request by drawing from the next cheapest pool.
                     To ensure that your target capacity is met, you might re-
                     ceive  Spot  Instances from more than the number of pools
                     that you specified. Similarly, if most of the pools  have
                     no  Spot capacity, you might receive your full target ca-
                     pacity from fewer than the number of pools that you spec-
                     ified.

                 SingleInstanceType -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  that  the fleet uses a single instance type to
                     launch all Spot Instances in the fleet.

                     Supported only for fleets of type instant .

                 SingleAvailabilityZone -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that the fleet launches all Spot Instances into
                     a single Availability Zone.

                     Supported only for fleets of type instant .

                 MinTargetCapacity -> (integer)
                     The  minimum  target  capacity  for Spot Instances in the
                     fleet. If the minimum target capacity is not reached, the
                     fleet launches no instances.

                     Supported only for fleets of type instant .

                     At  least  one  of  the following must be specified: Sin-
                     gleAvailabilityZone | SingleInstanceType

                 MaxTotalPrice -> (string)
                     The maximum amount  per  hour  for  Spot  Instances  that
                     you're willing to pay. We do not recommend using this pa-
                     rameter because it can lead to  increased  interruptions.
                     If  you  do  not specify this parameter, you will pay the
                     current Spot price.

                     WARNING:
                        If you specify a maximum price,  your  Spot  Instances
                        will be interrupted more frequently than if you do not
                        specify this parameter.

                     NOTE:
                        If your fleet includes T instances that are configured
                        as  unlimited , and if their average CPU usage exceeds
                        the baseline utilization, you will incur a charge  for
                        surplus  credits.  The  maxTotalPrice does not account
                        for surplus credits, and, if you use surplus  credits,
                        your  final  cost might be higher than what you speci-
                        fied for maxTotalPrice .  For  more  information,  see

                 The allocation strategy of  On-Demand  Instances  in  an  EC2
                 Fleet.

                 AllocationStrategy -> (string)
                     The strategy that determines the order of the launch tem-
                     plate overrides to use in fulfilling On-Demand capacity.
                        lowest-price - EC2 Fleet uses price to  determine  the
                        order, launching the lowest price first.

                        prioritized - EC2 Fleet uses the priority that you as-
                        signed to each launch template override, launching the
                        highest priority first.

                     Default: lowest-price

                 CapacityReservationOptions -> (structure)
                     The  strategy  for using unused Capacity Reservations for
                     fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

                     Supported only for fleets of type instant .

                     UsageStrategy -> (string)
                        Indicates whether to use unused Capacity  Reservations
                        for fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

                        If  you  specify use-capacity-reservations-first , the
                        fleet uses unused  Capacity  Reservations  to  fulfill
                        On-Demand  capacity  up to the target On-Demand capac-
                        ity. If multiple instance pools have  unused  Capacity
                        Reservations,  the On-Demand allocation strategy (low-
                        est-price or prioritized ) is applied. If  the  number
                        of  unused  Capacity  Reservations  is  less  than the
                        On-Demand target  capacity,  the  remaining  On-Demand
                        target capacity is launched according to the On-Demand
                        allocation strategy (lowest-price or prioritized ).

                        If you do not specify a value, the fleet  fulfils  the
                        On-Demand  capacity  according to the chosen On-Demand
                        allocation strategy.

                 SingleInstanceType -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that the fleet uses a single instance  type  to
                     launch all On-Demand Instances in the fleet.

                     Supported only for fleets of type instant .

                 SingleAvailabilityZone -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that the fleet launches all On-Demand Instances
                     into a single Availability Zone.

                     Supported only for fleets of type instant .

                 MinTargetCapacity -> (integer)
                     The minimum target capacity for  On-Demand  Instances  in
                     the fleet. If the minimum target capacity is not reached,
                     the fleet launches no instances.

                               NOTE:
                                   If you specify  InstanceType  ,  you  can't
                                   specify InstanceRequirements .

                            MaxPrice -> (string)
                               The  maximum  price  per unit hour that you are
                               willing to pay for a Spot Instance. We  do  not
                               recommend  using  this parameter because it can
                               lead to increased interruptions. If you do  not
                               specify  this  parameter, you will pay the cur-
                               rent Spot price.

                               WARNING:
                                   If you specify a maximum  price,  your  in-
                                   stances will be interrupted more frequently
                                   than if you do not specify this parameter.

                            SubnetId -> (string)
                               The ID of the subnet in which to launch the in-

                               instance type.

                            Priority -> (double)
                               The  priority for the launch template override.
                               The highest priority is launched first.

                               If the On-Demand AllocationStrategy is  set  to
                               prioritized , EC2 Fleet uses priority to deter-
                               mine which  launch  template  override  to  use
                               first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

                               If the Spot AllocationStrategy is set to capac-
                               ity-optimized-prioritized , EC2 Fleet uses pri-
                               ority on a best-effort basis to determine which
                               launch template override to use  in  fulfilling
                               Spot   capacity,  but  optimizes  for  capacity
                               first.

                               Valid values are whole numbers starting at 0  .
                               The  lower the number, the higher the priority.
                               If no number is set, the override has the  low-
                               est priority. You can set the same priority for
                               different launch template overrides.

                               specify  instance  attributes,  Amazon EC2 will
                               identify instance types with those attributes.

                               NOTE:
                                   If you specify InstanceRequirements  ,  you
                                   can't specify InstanceType .

                                   The instance types to exclude.

                                   You can use strings with one or  more  wild
                                   cards,  represented by an asterisk (* ), to
                                   exclude an instance type, size, or  genera-
                                   tion.    The    following   are   examples:
                                   m5.8xlarge , c5*.* , m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                                   For example, if you specify c5* ,Amazon EC2
                                   will exclude the entire C5 instance family,
                                   which includes all  C5a  and  C5n  instance
                                   types.  If  you  specify m5a.* , Amazon EC2
                                   will exclude all the  M5a  instance  types,
                                   but not the M5n instance types.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If  you  specify ExcludedInstanceTypes ,
                                      you can't specify AllowedInstanceTypes .

                                   attributes   against.  All  other  instance
                                   types are ignored, even if they match  your
                                   specified attributes.

                                   You  can  use strings with one or more wild
                                   cards, represented by an asterisk (* ),  to
                                   allow  an  instance  type, size, or genera-

                                   types. If you specify m5a.*  ,  Amazon  EC2
                                   will  allow all the M5a instance types, but
                                   not the M5n instance types.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If you  specify  AllowedInstanceTypes  ,

                               or $Default . You must specify a value,  other-
                               wise the request fails.

                               If  the  value is $Latest , Amazon EC2 uses the
                               latest version of the launch template.

                               If the value is $Default , Amazon EC2 uses  the
                               default version of the launch template.

                        Overrides -> (structure)
                            Any  parameters that you specify override the same
                            parameters in the launch template.

                            InstanceType -> (string)
                               The instance type.

                                   template override.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  you  specify  InstanceType  , you can't
                                   specify InstanceRequirements .

                            MaxPrice -> (string)
                               The maximum price per unit hour  that  you  are
                               willing  to  pay for a Spot Instance. We do not
                               recommend using this parameter because  it  can
                               lead  to increased interruptions. If you do not
                               specify this parameter, you will pay  the  cur-
                               rent Spot price.

                               WARNING:
                                   If  you  specify  a maximum price, your in-
                                   stances will be interrupted more frequently
                                   than if you do not specify this parameter.

                            SubnetId -> (string)
                               The ID of the subnet in which to launch the in-

                               instance type.

                            Priority -> (double)
                               The priority for the launch template  override.
                               The highest priority is launched first.

                               If  the  On-Demand AllocationStrategy is set to
                               prioritized , EC2 Fleet uses priority to deter-
                               mine  which  launch  template  override  to use
                               first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

                               If the Spot AllocationStrategy is set to capac-
                               ity-optimized-prioritized , EC2 Fleet uses pri-
                               ority on a best-effort basis to determine which
                               launch  template  override to use in fulfilling
                               Spot  capacity,  but  optimizes  for   capacity
                               first.

                               Valid  values are whole numbers starting at 0 .
                               The lower the number, the higher the  priority.
                               If  no number is set, the override has the low-
                               est priority. You can set the same priority for
                               different launch template overrides.

                               specify instance attributes,  Amazon  EC2  will
                               identify instance types with those attributes.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  you  specify InstanceRequirements , you

                                   per vCPU, in GiB.

                                   Default: No minimum or maximum limits

                                   Min -> (double)
                                      The  minimum  amount of memory per vCPU,
                                      in GiB. If this parameter is not  speci-
                                      fied, there is no minimum limit.

                                   Max -> (double)
                                      The  maximum  amount of memory per vCPU,
                                      in GiB. If this parameter is not  speci-

                               ExcludedInstanceTypes -> (list)
                                   The instance types to exclude.

                                   You  can  use strings with one or more wild
                                   cards, represented by an asterisk (* ),  to
                                   exclude  an instance type, size, or genera-
                                   tion.   The   following    are    examples:
                                   m5.8xlarge , c5*.* , m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                                   For example, if you specify c5* ,Amazon EC2
                                   will exclude the entire C5 instance family,
                                   which  includes  all  C5a  and C5n instance
                                   types. If you specify m5a.*  ,  Amazon  EC2
                                   will  exclude  all  the M5a instance types,
                                   but not the M5n instance types.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If you specify  ExcludedInstanceTypes  ,
                                      you can't specify AllowedInstanceTypes .

                                   The parameter  accepts  an  integer,  which
                                   Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage.

                                   To  turn  off  price  protection, specify a

                                   types.  If  you  specify m5a.* , Amazon EC2
                                   will allow all the M5a instance types,  but
                                   not the M5n instance types.
