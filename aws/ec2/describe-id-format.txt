DESCRIBE-ID-FORMAT()                                      DESCRIBE-ID-FORMAT()



NAME
       describe-id-format -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the ID format settings for your resources on a per-Region ba-
       sis, for example, to view which resource types are enabled  for  longer
       IDs.  This  request only returns information about resource types whose
       ID formats can be modified; it does not return information about  other
       resource types.

       The  following  resource  types  support  longer  IDs: bundle | conver-
       sion-task | customer-gateway | dhcp-options |  elastic-ip-allocation  |
       elastic-ip-association | export-task | flow-log | image | import-task |
       instance | internet-gateway | network-acl |  network-acl-association  |
       network-interface | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list | reser-
       vation | route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snap-
       shot  |  subnet  |  subnet-cidr-block-association  |  volume  |  vpc  |
       vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint  |  vpc-peering-connection  |
       vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

       These settings apply to the IAM user who makes the request; they do not
       apply to the entire Amazon Web Services account.  By  default,  an  IAM
       user  defaults  to  the same settings as the root user, unless they ex-
       plicitly override the settings by running the  ModifyIdFormat  command.
       Resources created with longer IDs are visible to all IAM users, regard-
       less of these settings and provided that they have  permission  to  use
       the relevant Describe command for the resource type.

OPTIONS
       --resource (string)
          The  type of resource: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway |
          dhcp-options | elastic-ip-allocation | elastic-ip-association |  ex-
          port-task  |  flow-log  |  image  |  import-task | instance | inter-
          net-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association | network-inter-
          face  |  network-interface-attachment  | prefix-list | reservation |
          route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snapshot  |
          subnet   |   subnet-cidr-block-association   |   volume   |   vpc  |
          vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint | vpc-peering-connection |
          vpn-connection | vpn-gateway

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To describe the ID format of a resource

       The following describe-id-format example describes the  ID  format  for
       security groups.

          aws ec2 describe-id-format \
              --resource security-group

       In  the following example output, the Deadline value indicates that the
       deadline for this resource type to permanently switch from the short ID
       format to the long ID format expired at 00:00 UTC on August 15, 2018.

          {
              "Statuses": [
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2018-08-15T00:00:00.000Z",
                      "Resource": "security-group",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To describe the ID format for all resources

       The  following  describe-id-format  example describes the ID format for
       all resource types. All resource types that supported the short ID for-
       mat were switched to use the long ID format.

          aws ec2 describe-id-format

OUTPUT
       Statuses -> (list)
          Information about the ID format for the resource.

          (structure)
              Describes the ID format for a resource.

              Deadline -> (timestamp)
                 The date in UTC at which you are permanently switched over to
                 using longer IDs. If a deadline is not yet available for this
                 resource type, this field is not returned.

              Resource -> (string)
                 The type of resource.

              UseLongIds -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  longer IDs (17-character IDs) are enabled
                 for the resource.
