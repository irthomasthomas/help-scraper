REGISTER-IMAGE()                                              REGISTER-IMAGE()



NAME
       register-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  an  AMI. When you're creating an AMI, this is the final step
       you must complete before you can launch an instance from the  AMI.  For
       more information about creating AMIs, see Creating your own AMIs in the
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       NOTE:
          For Amazon EBS-backed instances,  CreateImage creates and  registers
          the  AMI  in a single request, so you don't have to register the AMI
          yourself. We recommend that you always use  CreateImage  unless  you
          have a specific reason to use RegisterImage.

       If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you
       make to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its  reg-
       istration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous im-
       age and register the new image.
          Register a snapshot of a root device volume

       You can use RegisterImage to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from
       a  snapshot  of  a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using a
       block device mapping. You can't set the encryption state of the  volume
       using  the  block  device mapping. If the snapshot is encrypted, or en-
       cryption by default is enabled, the root volume of an instance launched
       from the AMI is encrypted.

       For  more  information,  see Create a Linux AMI from a snapshot and Use
       encryption with Amazon EBS-backed AMIs in the  Amazon  Elastic  Compute
       Cloud User Guide .
          Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes

       If  any  snapshots  have Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes,
       they are copied to the new AMI.

       Windows and some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise  Linux
       (RHEL)  and  SUSE  Linux  Enterprise  Server (SLES), use the Amazon EC2
       billing product code associated with an AMI to verify the  subscription
       status  for  package updates. To create a new AMI for operating systems
       that require a billing product code, instead of registering the AMI, do
       the following to preserve the billing product code association:

       o Launch  an  instance  from  an existing AMI with that billing product
         code.

       o Customize the instance.

       o Create an AMI from the instance using  CreateImage .

       If you purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an  On-Demand  Instance
       that  was  launched  from an AMI with a billing product code, make sure
       that the Reserved Instance has the matching billing  product  code.  If
       you  purchase  a Reserved Instance without the matching billing product
       code, the Reserved Instance will not be applied to  the  On-Demand  In-
       stance.  For  information  about how to obtain the platform details and
       billing information of an AMI, see Understanding  AMI  billing  in  the
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --image-location (string)
          The  full path to your AMI manifest in Amazon S3 storage. The speci-
          fied bucket must have the aws-exec-read canned access  control  list
          (ACL)  to ensure that it can be accessed by Amazon EC2. For more in-
          formation, see Canned ACLs in the Amazon S3 Service Developer  Guide
          .

       --architecture (string)
          The architecture of the AMI.

          Default:   For   Amazon   EBS-backed   AMIs,  i386  .  For  instance
          store-backed AMIs, the architecture specified in the manifest file.

          Possible values:

          o i386

          o x86_64

          o arm64

          o x86_64_mac

       --block-device-mappings (list)
          The block device mapping entries.

          If you specify an Amazon EBS volume using the ID of  an  Amazon  EBS
          snapshot, you can't specify the encryption state of the volume.

          If  you create an AMI on an Outpost, then all backing snapshots must
          be on the same Outpost or in the Region of that Outpost. AMIs on  an
          Outpost that include local snapshots can be used to launch instances
          on the same Outpost only. For more  information,  Amazon  EBS  local
          snapshots on Outposts in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide
          .

          (structure)
              Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS  volumes
              and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch.

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

              VirtualName -> (string)
                 The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes
                 are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2  avail-
                 able   instance   store  volumes  can  specify  mappings  for
                 ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available  instance
                 store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect
                 to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                 NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated  and
                 assigned  a  device name. Including them in your block device
                 mapping has no effect.

                 Constraints: For M3  instances,  you  must  specify  instance
                 store  volumes  in the block device mapping for the instance.
                 When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance  store
                 volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

              Ebs -> (structure)
                 Parameters  used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the
                 instance is launched.

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted  on  instance
                     termination.  For more information, see Preserving Amazon
                     EBS volumes on instance termination  in  the  Amazon  EC2
                     User Guide .

                 Iops -> (integer)
                     The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 ,
                     io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS
                     that  are  provisioned  for  the volume. For gp2 volumes,
                     this represents the baseline performance  of  the  volume
                     and  the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits
                     for bursting.

                     The following are the supported values  for  each  volume
                     type:

                     o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                     o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     For  io1  and  io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only
                     for Instances built on the Nitro System . Other  instance
                     families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                     This  parameter  is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The
                     default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter  is
                     not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                 SnapshotId -> (string)
                     The ID of the snapshot.

                 VolumeSize -> (integer)
                     The  size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either
                     a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you  specify  a  snap-
                     shot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a
                     volume size that is equal to or larger than the  snapshot
                     size.

                     The  following  are  the supported volumes sizes for each
                     volume type:

                     o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                     o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                     o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                     o standard : 1-1,024

                 VolumeType -> (string)
                     The volume type. For more  information,  see  Amazon  EBS
                     volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . If the volume
                     type is io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS  that  the
                     volume supports.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     Identifier  (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for
                     a customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is  en-
                     crypted.

                     This  parameter  is  only supported on BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects called by RunInstances , RequestSpotFleet  ,  and
                     RequestSpotInstances .

                 Throughput -> (integer)
                     The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                     This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                     Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                 OutpostArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored.

                     This  parameter  is  only supported on BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects called by CreateImage .

                 Encrypted -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the encryption state of an  EBS  volume
                     is  changed while being restored from a backing snapshot.
                     The effect of setting the encryption state  to  true  de-
                     pends  on  the  volume  origin  (new or from a snapshot),
                     starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryp-
                     tion  by  default  is  enabled. For more information, see
                     Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                     In no case can you remove encryption  from  an  encrypted
                     volume.

                     Encrypted  volumes can only be attached to instances that
                     support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information,  see
                     Supported instance types .

                     This  parameter is not returned by DescribeImageAttribute
                     .

              NoDevice -> (string)
                 To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify  an
                 empty  string. When this property is specified, the device is
                 removed from the block device mapping regardless of  the  as-
                 signed value.

            ...
          ]

       --description (string)
          A description for your AMI.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ena-support | --no-ena-support (boolean)
          Set to true to enable enhanced networking with ENA for the  AMI  and
          any instances that you launch from the AMI.

          This  option  is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying this option
          with a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable.

       --kernel-id (string)
          The ID of the kernel.

       --name (string)
          A name for your AMI.

          Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square
          brackets  ([]),  spaces  (  ), periods (.), slashes (/), dashes (-),
          single quotes ('), at-signs (@), or underscores(_)

       --billing-products (list)
          The billing product codes. Your account must be authorized to  spec-
          ify  billing  product  codes.  Otherwise, you can use the Amazon Web
          Services Marketplace to bill for the use of an AMI.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          The device name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1 ).

       --sriov-net-support (string)
          Set to simple to enable enhanced networking  with  the  Intel  82599
          Virtual  Function  interface  for the AMI and any instances that you
          launch from the AMI.

          There is no way to disable sriovNetSupport at this time.

          This option is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying  this  option
          with a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable.

       --virtualization-type (string)
          The type of virtualization (hvm | paravirtual ).

          Default: paravirtual

       --boot-mode (string)
          The  boot  mode  of the AMI. For more information, see Boot modes in
          the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o legacy-bios

          o uefi

       --tpm-support (string)
          Set to v2.0 to enable Trusted Platform  Module  (TPM)  support.  For
          more  information,  see NitroTPM in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
          User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o v2.0

       --uefi-data (string)
          Base64 representation of the non-volatile UEFI  variable  store.  To
          retrieve the UEFI data, use the GetInstanceUefiData command. You can
          inspect and modify the UEFI data by using the  python-uefivars  tool
          on  GitHub. For more information, see UEFI Secure Boot in the Amazon
          Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       --imds-support (string)
          Set to v2.0 to indicate that IMDSv2 is specified  in  the  AMI.  In-
          stances  launched  from  this AMI will have HttpTokens automatically
          set to required so that, by  default,  the  instance  requires  that
          IMDSv2 is used when requesting instance metadata. In addition, Http-
          PutResponseHopLimit  is  set  to  2  .  For  more  information,  see
          Configure the AMI in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

          NOTE:
              If  you set the value to v2.0 , make sure that your AMI software
              can support IMDSv2.

          Possible values:

          o v2.0

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       Example 1: To register an AMI using a manifest file

       The following register-image example registers an AMI using the  speci-
       fied manifest file in Amazon S3.

          aws ec2 register-image \
              --name my-image \
              --image-location my-s3-bucket/myimage/image.manifest.xml

       Output:

          {
              "ImageId": "ami-1234567890EXAMPLE"
          }

       For more information, see Amazon Machine Images (AMI) in the Amazon EC2
       User Guide.

       Example 2: To register an AMI using a snapshot of a root device

       The following register-image example registers an AMI using the  speci-
       fied  snapshot of an EBS root volume as device /dev/xvda. The block de-
       vice mapping also includes an  empty  100  GiB  EBS  volume  as  device
       /dev/xvdf.

          aws ec2 register-image \
              --name my-image \
              --root-device-name /dev/xvda \
              --block-device-mappings DeviceName=/dev/xvda,Ebs={SnapshotId=snap-0db2cf683925d191f} DeviceName=/dev/xvdf,Ebs={VolumeSize=100}

       Output:

          {
              "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d5eEXAMPLE"
          }
