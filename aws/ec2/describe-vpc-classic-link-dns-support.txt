NAME
       describe-vpc-classic-link-dns-support -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  ClassicLink  DNS support status of one or more VPCs. If
       enabled, the DNS hostname of a linked EC2-Classic instance resolves  to
       its  private  IP  address when addressed from an instance in the VPC to
       which it's linked. Similarly, the DNS hostname of an instance in a  VPC
       resolves  to  its  private  IP  address  when  addressed  from a linked
       EC2-Classic instance. For more information, see ClassicLink in the Ama-
       zon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-vpc-classic-link-dns-support  is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate ar-
       gument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a  pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Vpcs

SYNOPSIS
            describe-vpc-classic-link-dns-support
          [--vpc-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vpc-ids (list)
          One or more VPC IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe ClassicLink DNS support for your VPCs

       This  example  describes  the  ClassicLink DNS support status of all of
       your VPCs.

       Command:

          aws ec2 describe-vpc-classic-link-dns-support

       Output:

          {
            "Vpcs": [
              {
                "VpcId": "vpc-88888888",
                "ClassicLinkDnsSupported": true
              },
              {
                "VpcId": "vpc-1a2b3c4d",
                "ClassicLinkDnsSupported": false
              }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.

       Vpcs -> (list)
          Information about the ClassicLink DNS support status of the VPCs.

          (structure)
              Describes the ClassicLink DNS support status of a VPC.

              ClassicLinkDnsSupported -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether ClassicLink DNS support is enabled for the
                 VPC.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC.
