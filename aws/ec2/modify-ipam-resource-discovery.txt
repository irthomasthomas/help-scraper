NAME
       modify-ipam-resource-discovery -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a  resource discovery. A resource discovery is an IPAM compo-
       nent that enables IPAM to manage and monitor resources that  belong  to
       the owning account.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-resource-discovery-id (string)
          A resource discovery ID.

       --description (string)
          A resource discovery description.

       --add-operating-regions (list)
          Add operating Regions to the resource discovery.  Operating  Regions
          are  Amazon Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage
          IP address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in  the
          Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

          (structure)
              Add an operating Region to an IPAM. Operating Regions are Amazon
              Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage IP  ad-
              dress  CIDRs.  IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in the
              Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

              For more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM
              in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the operating Region.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegionName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --remove-operating-regions (list)
          Remove operating Regions.

          (structure)
              Remove  an  operating Region from an IPAM. Operating Regions are
              Amazon Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to  manage
              IP  address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in
              the Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

              For more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM
              in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the operating Region you want to remove.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegionName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
