DESCRIBE-FLEET-HISTORY()                              DESCRIBE-FLEET-HISTORY()



NAME
       describe-fleet-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  events for the specified EC2 Fleet during the specified
       time.

       EC2 Fleet events are delayed by up to 30 seconds before they can be de-
       scribed. This ensures that you can query by the last evaluated time and
       not miss a recorded event. EC2 Fleet events are available for 48 hours.

       For more information, see Monitor fleet events using Amazon EventBridge
       in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --event-type (string)
          The type of events to describe.  By  default,  all  events  are  de-
          scribed.

          Possible values:

          o instance-change

          o fleet-change

          o service-error

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of items to return for this request. To get the
          next page of items, make another request with the token returned  in
          the output. For more information, see Pagination .

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  returned  from  a previous paginated request. Pagination
          continues from the end of the items returned  by  the  previous  re-
          quest.

       --fleet-id (string)
          The ID of the EC2 Fleet.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  start date and time for the events, in UTC format (for example,
          YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe EC2 Fleet history

       The following describe-fleet-history example returns  the  history  for
       the  specified  EC2 Fleet starting at the specified time. The output is
       for an EC2 Fleet with two running instances.

                       tion  is  not  valid. For more information, see the de-
                       scription of the event.
                        fleetRequestChange events:

                     o active - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request  has  been
                       validated  and Amazon EC2 is attempting to maintain the
                       target number of running instances.

                     o deleted (EC2 Fleet) / cancelled (Spot Fleet) - The  EC2
                       Fleet  is deleted or the Spot Fleet request is canceled
                       and has no running instances. The  EC2  Fleet  or  Spot
                       Fleet  will be deleted two days after its instances are
                       terminated.

                     o deleted_running (EC2 Fleet) /  cancelled_running  (Spot
                       Fleet) - The EC2 Fleet is deleted or the Spot Fleet re-
                       quest is canceled and does not  launch  additional  in-
                       stances.  Its  existing instances continue to run until
                       they are interrupted or terminated. The request remains
                       in  this  state  until all instances are interrupted or
                       terminated.

                     o deleted_terminating (EC2 Fleet) / cancelled_terminating
                       (Spot  Fleet)  -  The  EC2 Fleet is deleted or the Spot
                       Fleet request is canceled and its instances are  termi-
                       nating. The request remains in this state until all in-
                       stances are terminated.

                     o expired - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request  has  ex-
                       pired.  If  the  request  was created with TerminateIn-
                       stancesWithExpiration  set,  a  subsequent   terminated
                       event indicates that the instances are terminated.

                     o modify_in_progress  -  The  EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet re-
                       quest is being modified. The request  remains  in  this
                       state until the modification is fully processed.

                     o modify_succeeded  - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request
                       was modified.

                     o submitted - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is  be-
                       ing evaluated and Amazon EC2 is preparing to launch the
                       target number of instances.

                     o progress - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet  request  is  in
                       the process of being fulfilled.
                        instanceChange events:

                     o launched - A new instance was launched.

                     o terminated - An instance was terminated by the user.

                     o termination_notified  - An instance termination notifi-
                       cation was sent when a Spot Instance was terminated  by
                       Amazon  EC2 during scale-down, when the target capacity
                       of the fleet was modified down,  for  example,  from  a
                       target capacity of 4 to a target capacity of 3.
                        Information events:

                     o fleetProgressHalted  - The price in every launch speci-
                       fication is not valid because  it  is  below  the  Spot
                       price  (all  the  launch  specifications  have produced
                       launchSpecUnusable  events).  A  launch   specification
                       might become valid if the Spot price changes.

                     o launchSpecTemporarilyBlacklisted - The configuration is
                       not valid and several attempts to launch instances have
                       failed.  For  more  information, see the description of
                       the event.

                     o launchSpecUnusable - The price in a  launch  specifica-
                       tion is not valid because it is below the Spot price.

                     o registerWithLoadBalancersFailed  - An attempt to regis-
                       ter instances with load balancers failed. For more  in-
                       formation, see the description of the event.

                 InstanceId -> (string)
                     The  ID  of  the  instance. This information is available
                     only for instanceChange events.

              EventType -> (string)
                 The event type.

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the event, in UTC format  (for  example,
                 YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z).

       LastEvaluatedTime -> (timestamp)
          The  last  date and time for the events, in UTC format (for example,
          YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z). All records up to this time were  re-
          trieved.

          If  nextToken indicates that there are more items, this value is not
          present.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to include in another request to  get  the  next  page  of
          items. This value is null when there are no more items to return.

       FleetId -> (string)
          The ID of the EC Fleet.

       StartTime -> (timestamp)
          The  start date and time for the events, in UTC format (for example,
          YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z).
