OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM you want to modify.

       --description (string)
          The description of the IPAM you want to modify.

       --add-operating-regions (list)
          Choose the operating Regions for the  IPAM.  Operating  Regions  are
          Amazon  Web  Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage IP
          address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and  monitors  resources  in  the
          Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

          For  more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM in
          the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

          (structure)
              Add an operating Region to an IPAM. Operating Regions are Amazon
              Web  Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage IP ad-
              dress CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources  in  the
              Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

              For more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM
              in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the operating Region.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegionName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --remove-operating-regions (list)
          The operating Regions to remove.

          (structure)
              Remove an operating Region from an IPAM. Operating  Regions  are
              Amazon  Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage
              IP address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources  in
              the Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

              For more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM
              in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the operating Region you want to remove.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegionName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tier (string)
          IPAM is offered in a Free Tier and an Advanced Tier. For more infor-
          mation about the features available in each tier and the costs asso-
          ciated with the tiers, see Amazon VPC pricing > IPAM tab .

          Possible values:

          o free

          o advanced

       --enable-private-gua | --no-enable-private-gua (boolean)
          Enable this option to use your own GUA ranges as  private  IPv6  ad-
          dresses. This option is disabled by default.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
