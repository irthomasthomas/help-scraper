CREATE-SECURITY-GROUP()                                CREATE-SECURITY-GROUP()



NAME
       create-security-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a security group.

       A  security  group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to con-
       trol inbound and outbound traffic. For more information, see Amazon EC2
       security  groups  in  the  Amazon  Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide and
       Security groups for your VPC in the Amazon Virtual Private  Cloud  User
       Guide .

       When  you  create a security group, you specify a friendly name of your
       choice. You can have a security group for use in EC2-Classic  with  the
       same name as a security group for use in a VPC. However, you can't have
       two security groups for use in EC2-Classic with the same  name  or  two
       security groups for use in a VPC with the same name.

       You  have a default security group for use in EC2-Classic and a default
       security group for use in your VPC. If you  don't  specify  a  security
       group  when  you  launch an instance, the instance is launched into the
       appropriate default security group. A default security group includes a
       default  rule that grants instances unrestricted network access to each
       other.

       You can add or remove rules from your  security  groups  using   Autho-
       rizeSecurityGroupIngress ,  AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress ,  RevokeSecu-
       rityGroupIngress , and  RevokeSecurityGroupEgress .

       For more information about VPC security group limits,  see  Amazon  VPC
       Limits .

       NOTE:
          We  are  retiring  EC2-Classic on August 15, 2022. We recommend that
          you migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC.  For  more  information,  see
          Migrate  from  EC2-Classic  to  a  VPC in the Amazon Elastic Compute
          Cloud User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A description for the security group. This is informational only.

          Constraints: Up to 255 characters in length

          Constraints for EC2-Classic: ASCII characters

          Constraints   for   EC2-VPC:   a-z,   A-Z,    0-9,    spaces,    and
          ._-:/()#,@[]+=&;{}!$*

       --group-name (string)
          The name of the security group.

          Constraints: Up to 255 characters in length. Cannot start with sg- .

          Constraints for EC2-Classic: ASCII characters

          Constraints    for    EC2-VPC:    a-z,   A-Z,   0-9,   spaces,   and
          ._-:/()#,@[]+=&;{}!$*

       --vpc-id (string)
          [EC2-VPC] The ID of the VPC. Required for EC2-VPC.

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to assign to the security group.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated.

              NOTE:
                 The  Valid  Values  lists  all the resource types that can be
                 tagged. However, the action you're using  might  not  support
                 tagging  all of these resource types. If you try to tag a re-
                 source type that is unsupported for the action you're  using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,Tags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceType": "capacity-reservation"|"client-vpn-endpoint"|"customer-gateway"|"carrier-gateway"|"dedicated-host"|"dhcp-options"|"egress-only-internet-gateway"|"elastic-ip"|"elastic-gpu"|"export-image-task"|"export-instance-task"|"fleet"|"fpga-image"|"host-reservation"|"image"|"import-image-task"|"import-snapshot-task"|"instance"|"instance-event-window"|"internet-gateway"|"ipam"|"ipam-pool"|"ipam-scope"|"ipv4pool-ec2"|"ipv6pool-ec2"|"key-pair"|"launch-template"|"local-gateway"|"local-gateway-route-table"|"local-gateway-virtual-interface"|"local-gateway-virtual-interface-group"|"local-gateway-route-table-vpc-association"|"local-gateway-route-table-virtual-interface-group-association"|"natgateway"|"network-acl"|"network-interface"|"network-insights-analysis"|"network-insights-path"|"network-insights-access-scope"|"network-insights-access-scope-analysis"|"placement-group"|"prefix-list"|"replace-root-volume-task"|"reserved-instances"|"route-table"|"security-group"|"security-group-rule"|"snapshot"|"spot-fleet-request"|"spot-instances-request"|"subnet"|"subnet-cidr-reservation"|"traffic-mirror-filter"|"traffic-mirror-session"|"traffic-mirror-target"|"transit-gateway"|"transit-gateway-attachment"|"transit-gateway-connect-peer"|"transit-gateway-multicast-domain"|"transit-gateway-policy-table"|"transit-gateway-route-table"|"transit-gateway-route-table-announcement"|"volume"|"vpc"|"vpc-endpoint"|"vpc-endpoint-service"|"vpc-peering-connection"|"vpn-connection"|"vpn-gateway"|"vpc-flow-log",
              "Tags": [
                {
                  "Key": "string",
                  "Value": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a security group for EC2-Classic

       This example creates a security group named MySecurityGroup.
