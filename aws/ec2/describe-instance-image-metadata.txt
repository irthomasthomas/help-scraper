DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-IMAGE-METADATA()          DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-IMAGE-METADATA()



NAME
       describe-instance-image-metadata -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the AMI that was used to launch an instance, even if the AMI
       is deprecated, deregistered, or  made  private  (no  longer  public  or
       shared with your account).

       If  you  specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only
       the specified instances. If you specify filters,  the  output  includes
       information  for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If
       you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes  infor-
       mation for all instances, which can affect performance.

       If  you  specify  an  instance  ID  that is not valid, an instance that
       doesn't exist, or an instance that you do not own, an error (InvalidIn-
       stanceID.NotFound ) is returned.

       Recently  terminated  instances  might  appear in the returned results.
       This interval is usually less than one hour.

       In the rare case where an Availability Zone is experiencing  a  service
       disruption and you specify instance IDs that are in the affected Avail-
       ability Zone, or do not specify any  instance  IDs  at  all,  the  call
       fails.  If  you  specify  only  instance  IDs that are in an unaffected
       Availability Zone, the call works normally.

       NOTE:
          The order of the elements in the response,  including  those  within
          nested  structures,  might  vary. Applications should not assume the
          elements appear in a particular order.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-instance-image-metadata is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: InstanceImageMetadata

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o availability-zone  -  The name of the Availability Zone (for exam-
            ple, us-west-2a ) or Local Zone (for example,  us-west-2-lax-1b  )
            of the instance.

          o instance-id - The ID of the instance.

          o instance-state-name - The state of the instance (pending | running
            | shutting-down | terminated | stopping | stopped ).

          o instance-type - The type of instance (for example, t3.micro ).

          o launch-time - The time when the instance was launched, in the  ISO
            8601  format  in the UTC time zone (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ), for
            example, 2023-09-29T11:04:43.305Z . You can use a wildcard  (*  ),
            for example, 2023-09-29T* , which matches an entire day.

          o tag:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the re-
            source. Use the tag key in the filter name and the  tag  value  as
            the  filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,  re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o zone-id - The ID of the Availability Zone (for example, usw2-az2 )
            or Local Zone (for example, usw2-lax1-az1 ) of the instance.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --instance-ids (list)
          The instance IDs.

          If you don't specify an instance ID or filters, the output  includes
          information for all instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       InstanceImageMetadata -> (list)
          Information  about  the  instance and the AMI used to launch the in-
          stance.

          (structure)
              Information about the instance and the AMI used  to  launch  the
              instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the instance.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The instance type.

              LaunchTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the instance was launched.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone or Local Zone of the instance.

              ZoneId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the  Availability  Zone or Local Zone of the in-
                 stance.

              State -> (structure)
                 The current state of the instance.

                 Code -> (integer)
                     The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

                     The high  byte  is  all  of  the  bits  between  2^8  and
                     (2^16)-1,  which  equals  decimal  values between 256 and
                     65,535. These numerical values are used for internal pur-
                     poses and should be ignored.

                     The  low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1,
                     which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.

                     The valid values for instance-state-code will all  be  in
                     the range of the low byte and they are:

                     o 0 : pending

                     o 16 : running

                     o 32 : shutting-down

                     o 48 : terminated

                     o 64 : stopping

                     o 80 : stopped

                     You  can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of
                     the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The current state of the instance.

                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

              ImageMetadata -> (structure)
                 Information about the AMI used to launch the instance.

                 ImageId -> (string)

                     the AMI is successfully registered and  can  be  used  to
                     launch an instance.

                 ImageOwnerAlias -> (string)
                     The alias of the AMI owner.

                     sions, while false means it has only implicit (AMI owner)
                     or  explicit  (shared  with  your account) launch permis-
                     sions.

              Operator -> (structure)
                 The entity that manages the instance.

                 Managed -> (boolean)
                     If true , the resource is managed by an entity.

                 Principal -> (string)
                     If managed is true , then the principal is returned.  The
                     principal is the entity that manages the resource.

       NextToken -> (string)
