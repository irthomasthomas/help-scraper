TERMINATE-CLIENT-VPN-CONNECTIONS()          TERMINATE-CLIENT-VPN-CONNECTIONS()



NAME
       terminate-client-vpn-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Terminates  active  Client VPN endpoint connections. This action can be
       used to terminate a specific client connection, or up to  five  connec-
       tions established by a specific user.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            terminate-client-vpn-connections
          --client-vpn-endpoint-id <value>
          [--connection-id <value>]
          [--username <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-vpn-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the Client VPN endpoint to which the client is connected.

       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the client connection to be terminated.

       --username (string)
          The  name  of the user who initiated the connection. Use this option
          to terminate all active connections for the specified user. This op-
          tion can only be used if the user has established up to five connec-
          tions.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To terminate a connection to a Client VPN endpoint

       The  following  terminate-client-vpn-connections example terminates the
       specified connection to the Client VPN endpoint.

          aws ec2 terminate-client-vpn-connections \
              --client-vpn-endpoint-id vpn-endpoint-123456789123abcde \
              --connection-id cvpn-connection-04edd76f5201e0cb8

       Output:

          {
              "ClientVpnEndpointId": "vpn-endpoint-123456789123abcde",
              "ConnectionStatuses": [
                  {
                      "ConnectionId": "cvpn-connection-04edd76f5201e0cb8",
                      "PreviousStatus": {
                          "Code": "active"
