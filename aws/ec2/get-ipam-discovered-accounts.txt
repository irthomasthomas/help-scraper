GET-IPAM-DISCOVERED-ACCOUNTS()                  GET-IPAM-DISCOVERED-ACCOUNTS()



NAME
       get-ipam-discovered-accounts -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  IPAM  discovered  accounts. A discovered account is an Amazon Web
       Services account that is monitored under a resource discovery.  If  you
       have  integrated  IPAM  with Amazon Web Services Organizations, all ac-
       counts in the organization are discovered accounts. Only the  IPAM  ac-
       count can get all discovered accounts in the organization.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-ipam-discovered-accounts  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: IpamDiscoveredAccounts

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-resource-discovery-id (string)
          A resource discovery ID.

       --discovery-region (string)
          The  Amazon  Web Services Region that the account information is re-
          turned from.

       --filters (list)
          Discovered account filters.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       IpamDiscoveredAccounts -> (list)
          Discovered accounts.

          (structure)
              An IPAM discovered account. A discovered account  is  an  Amazon
              Web  Services account that is monitored under a resource discov-
              ery. If you have integrated IPAM with Amazon Web Services  Orga-
              nizations,  all  accounts in the organization are discovered ac-
              counts.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The account ID.

              DiscoveryRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region that the  account  information
                 is  returned  from.  An account can be discovered in multiple
                 regions and will have a separate discovered account for  each
                 Region.

              FailureReason -> (structure)
                 The resource discovery failure reason.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The discovery failure code.

                     o assume-role-failure  - IPAM could not assume the Amazon
                       Web Services IAM service-linked role. This could be be-
                       cause of any of the following:

                       o SLR has not been created yet and IPAM is still creat-
                         ing it.

                       o You have opted-out of the IPAM home Region.

                       o Account you are using as your IPAM account  has  been
                         suspended.

                     o throttling-failure  - IPAM account is already using the
                       allotted transactions per second and IPAM is  receiving
                       a  throttling  error  when assuming the Amazon Web Ser-
                       vices IAM SLR.

                     o unauthorized-failure - Amazon Web Services account mak-
                       ing  the  request  is not authorized. For more informa-
                       tion, see AuthFailure in  the  Amazon  Elastic  Compute
                       Cloud API Reference .

                 Message -> (string)
                     The discovery failure message.

              LastAttemptedDiscoveryTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last attempted resource discovery time.

              LastSuccessfulDiscoveryTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last successful resource discovery time.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Specify the pagination token from a previous request to retrieve the
          next page of results.
