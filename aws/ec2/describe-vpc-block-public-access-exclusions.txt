NAME
       describe-vpc-block-public-access-exclusions -

DESCRIPTION
       Describe  VPC Block Public Access (BPA) exclusions. A VPC BPA exclusion
       is a mode that can be applied to a single VPC or subnet that exempts it
       from  the accounts BPA mode and will allow bidirectional or egress-only
       access. You can create BPA exclusions for VPCs and  subnets  even  when
       BPA  is  not  enabled on the account to ensure that there is no traffic
       disruption to the exclusions when VPC BPA is turned on. To  learn  more
       about  VPC BPA, see Block public access to VPCs and subnets in the Ama-
       zon VPC User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          Filters for the request:

          o resource-arn - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a exclusion.

          o internet-gateway-exclusion-mode - The mode of a VPC BPA exclusion.
            Possible values: bidirectional-access-allowed |  egress-access-al-
            lowed .

          o state  - The state of VPC BPA. Possible values: create-in-progress
            |  create-complete  |  update-in-progress  |   update-complete   |
            delete-in-progress | deleted-complete | disable-in-progress | dis-
            able-complete

          o tag - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
            Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter
            value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the
            key  Owner  and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for the filter
            name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter  to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o tag-value : The value of a tag assigned to the resource. Use  this
            filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific value,
            regardless of the tag key.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --exclusion-ids (list)
          IDs of exclusions.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token returned from a  previous  paginated  request.  Pagination
          continues  from  the  end  of the items returned by the previous re-
          quest.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return for this request. To  get  the
          next  page of items, make another request with the token returned in
          the output. For more information, see Pagination .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT

          Details related to the exclusions.

          (structure)
              A VPC BPA exclusion is a mode that can be applied  to  a  single
              VPC  or  subnet  that  exempts it from the accounts BPA mode and
              will allow bidirectional or egress-only access. You  can  create
              BPA exclusions for VPCs and subnets even when BPA is not enabled
              on the account to ensure that there is no traffic disruption  to
              the  exclusions  when  VPC BPA is turned on. To learn more about
              VPC BPA, see Block public access to VPCs and subnets in the Ama-
              zon VPC User Guide .

                     sources that have a tag with the key Owner and the  value
                     TeamA  ,  specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA
                     for the filter value.
