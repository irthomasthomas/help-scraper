DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-TYPE-OFFERINGS()          DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-TYPE-OFFERINGS()



NAME
       describe-instance-type-offerings -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  instance types that are offered for the specified location.
       If no location is specified, the default is to list the instance  types
       that are offered in the current Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-instance-type-offerings is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: InstanceTypeOfferings

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --location-type (string)
          The location type.

          o availability-zone  - The Availability Zone. When you specify a lo-
            cation filter, it must be an Availability Zone for the current Re-
            gion.

          o availability-zone-id - The AZ ID. When you specify a location fil-
            ter, it must be an AZ ID for the current Region.

          o outpost - The Outpost ARN. When you specify a location filter,  it
            must be an Outpost ARN for the current Region.

          o region  - The current Region. If you specify a location filter, it
            must match the current Region.

          Possible values:

          o region

          o availability-zone

          o availability-zone-id

          o outpost

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters. Filter names and values are case-sensitive.

          o instance-type - The instance type. For a list of possible  values,
            see Instance .

          o location  -  The location. For a list of possible identifiers, see
            Regions and Zones .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list the instance types offered in a Region

       The  following  describe-instance-type-offerings  example lists the in-
       stance types offered in the Region configured as the default Region for
       the AWS CLI.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings

       To  list  the instance types offered in a different Region, specify the
       Region using the --region parameter.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --region us-east-2

       Output:

          {
            "InstanceTypeOfferings": [
                {
                    "InstanceType": "m5.2xlarge",
                    "LocationType": "region",
                    "Location": "us-east-2"
                },
                {
                    "InstanceType": "t3.micro",
                    "LocationType": "region",
                    "Location": "us-east-2"
                },
                ...
            ]
          }

       Example 2: To list the instance types offered in an Availability Zone

       The following describe-instance-type-offerings example  lists  the  in-
       stance types offered in the specified Availability Zone. The Availabil-
       ity Zone must be in the specified Region.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --location-type availability-zone \
              --filters Name=location,Values=us-east-2a \
              --region us-east-2

       Example 3: To check whether an instance type is supported

       The  following   describe-instance-type-offerings   command   indicates
       whether  the  c5.xlarge instance type is supported in the specified Re-
       gion.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --filters Name=instance-type,Values=c5.xlarge \
              --region us-east-2

       The following describe-instance-type-offerings example lists all C5 in-
       stance types that are supported in the specified Region.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --filters Name=instance-type,Values=c5* \
              --query "InstanceTypeOfferings[].InstanceType" \
              --region us-east-2

       Output:
