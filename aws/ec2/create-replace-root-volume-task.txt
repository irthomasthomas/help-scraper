NAME
       create-replace-root-volume-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Replaces  the  EBS-backed root volume for a running instance with a new
       volume that is restored to the original  root  volume's  launch  state,
       that  is  restored  to a specific snapshot taken from the original root
       volume, or that is restored from an AMI that has the same  key  charac-
       teristics as that of the instance.

       For  more  information, see Replace a root volume in the Amazon Elastic
       Compute Cloud User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance for which to replace the root volume.

       --snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the snapshot from which to restore  the  replacement  root
          volume.  The  specified  snapshot must be a snapshot that you previ-
          ously created from the original root volume.

          If you want to restore the replacement root volume  to  the  initial
          launch  state, or if you want to restore the replacement root volume
          from an AMI, omit this parameter.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the  idempo-
          tency  of  the request. If you do not specify a client token, a ran-
          domly generated token is used for the request to ensure idempotency.
          For more information, see Ensuring idempotency .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to apply to the root volume replacement task.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated.

              NOTE:
                 The  Valid  Values  lists  all the resource types that can be
                 tagged. However, the action you're using  might  not  support
                 tagging  all of these resource types. If you try to tag a re-
                 source type that is unsupported for the action you're  using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

            ...
          ]

       --image-id (string)
          The ID of the AMI to use to restore the root volume.  The  specified
          AMI  must have the same product code, billing information, architec-
          ture type, and virtualization type as that of the instance.

          If you want to restore the replacement volume from a specific  snap-
          shot,  or  if  you want to restore it to its launch state, omit this
          parameter.

       --delete-replaced-root-volume | --no-delete-replaced-root-volume (bool-
       ean)
          Indicates  whether  to automatically delete the original root volume
          after the root volume replacement  task  completes.  To  delete  the
          original root volume, specify true . If you choose to keep the orig-
          inal root volume after the replacement task completes, you must man-
          ually delete it when you no longer need it.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To restore a root volume to its initial launch state

       The following create-replace-root-volume-task example restores the root
       volume of instance i-0123456789abcdefa to its initial launch state.

          aws ec2 create-replace-root-volume-task \
              --instance-id i-0123456789abcdefa

       Output:
