NAME
       associate-ipam-resource-discovery -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  an  IPAM  resource discovery with an Amazon VPC IPAM. A re-
       source discovery is an IPAM component that enables IPAM to  manage  and
       monitor resources that belong to the owning account.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-id (string)
          An IPAM ID.

       --ipam-resource-discovery-id (string)
          A resource discovery ID.

       --tag-specifications (list)
          Tag specifications.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type
              to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

              NOTE:
                 The Valid Values lists all the resource  types  that  can  be
                 tagged.  However,  the  action you're using might not support
                 tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a  re-
                 source  type that is unsupported for the action you're using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          A client token.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To associate a resource discovery with an IPAM

       In this example, you are an IPAM delegated admin and a resource discov-
       ery has been created and shared with you by another AWS account so that
       you can use IPAM to manage and monitor  resource  CIDRs  owned  by  the
       other account.

       Note

       o To complete this request, you'll need the resource discovery ID which
         you can get with describe-ipam-resource-discoveries and the  IPAM  ID
         which you can get with describe-ipams.

       o The  resource discovery that you are associating must have first been
         shared with your account using AWS RAM.

       o The --region you enter must match the home Region of the IPAM you are
         associating it with.

       The  following  associate-ipam-resource-discovery  example associates a
       resource discovery with an IPAM.

          aws ec2 associate-ipam-resource-discovery \
              --ipam-id ipam-005f921c17ebd5107 \
              --ipam-resource-discovery-id ipam-res-disco-03e0406de76a044ee \
              --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=ipam-resource-discovery,Tags=[{Key=cost-center,Value=cc123}]' \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              {
                  "IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociation": {
                      "OwnerId": "320805250157",
                      "IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociationId": "ipam-res-disco-assoc-04382a6346357cf82",
                      "IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociationArn": "arn:aws:ec2::320805250157:ipam-resource-discovery-association/ipam-res-disco-assoc-04382a6346357cf82",
                      "IpamResourceDiscoveryId": "ipam-res-disco-0365d2977fc1672fe",
                      "IpamId": "ipam-005f921c17ebd5107",
                      "IpamArn": "arn:aws:ec2::320805250157:ipam/ipam-005f921c17ebd5107",
                      "IpamRegion": "us-east-1",
                      "IsDefault": false,
                      "ResourceDiscoveryStatus": "active",
                      "State": "associate-in-progress",
                      "Tags": []
                  }
              }
          }

       Once you associate a resource discovery, you can monitor and/or  manage
       the  IP  addresses of resources created by the other accounts. For more
       information, see Integrate IPAM with accounts outside of your organiza-
       tion in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide.

OUTPUT
       IpamResourceDiscoveryAssociation -> (structure)
          A  resource  discovery association. An associated resource discovery
          is a resource discovery that has been associated with an IPAM.

          OwnerId -> (string)

              The IPAM home Region.

          IsDefault -> (boolean)
              Defines  if the resource discovery is the default. When you cre-
              ate an IPAM, a default resource discovery is  created  for  your
              IPAM and it's associated with your IPAM.

          ResourceDiscoveryStatus -> (string)
              The resource discovery status.

              o active  -  Connection  or permissions required to read the re-
                sults of the resource discovery are intact.

              o not-found - Connection or permissions required to read the re-
                sults of the resource discovery are broken. This may happen if
                the owner of the resource  discovery  stopped  sharing  it  or
                deleted  the resource discovery. Verify the resource discovery
                still exists and the Amazon Web Services RAM resource share is
                still intact.

                failed.

              o isolate-in-progress - Amazon Web Services account that created
                the resource discovery association has been  removed  and  the
                resource discovery associatation is being isolated.

              o isolate-complete - Resource discovery isolation is complete..

              o restore-in-progress - Resource discovery is being restored.

          Tags -> (list)
              A  tag  is a label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services re-
              source. Each tag consists of a key and an  optional  value.  You
              can  use  tags to search and filter your resources or track your
              Amazon Web Services costs.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.
