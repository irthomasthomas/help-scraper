LOCK-SNAPSHOT()                                                LOCK-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       lock-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Locks an Amazon EBS snapshot in either governance or compliance mode to
       protect it against accidental or malicious deletions for a specific du-
       ration. A locked snapshot can't be deleted.

       You can also use this action to modify the lock settings for a snapshot
       that is already locked. The allowed modifications depend  on  the  lock
       mode and lock state:

       o If the snapshot is locked in governance mode, you can modify the lock
         mode and the lock duration or lock expiration date.

       o If the snapshot is locked in compliance mode and it is in  the  cool-
         ing-off period, you can modify the lock mode and the lock duration or
         lock expiration date.

       o If the snapshot is locked in compliance mode and the cooling-off  pe-
         riod  has  lapsed,  you can only increase the lock duration or extend
         the lock expiration date.

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the snapshot to lock.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --lock-mode (string)
          The  mode  in which to lock the snapshot. Specify one of the follow-
          ing:

          o governance - Locks the  snapshot  in  governance  mode.  Snapshots
            locked  in  governance mode can't be deleted until one of the fol-
            lowing conditions are met:

            o The lock duration expires.

            o The snapshot is unlocked by a user with the appropriate  permis-
              sions.

          Users  with the appropriate IAM permissions can unlock the snapshot,
          increase or decrease the lock duration, and change the lock mode  to
          compliance at any time.

          If you lock a snapshot in governance mode, omit CoolOffPeriod .

          o compliance  -  Locks  the  snapshot  in compliance mode. Snapshots
            locked in compliance mode can't be unlocked by any user. They  can
            be  deleted  only after the lock duration expires. Users can't de-
            crease the lock duration or change the lock mode to  governance  .
            However,  users  with appropriate IAM permissions can increase the
            lock duration at any time. If you lock a  snapshot  in  compliance
            mode, you can optionally specify CoolOffPeriod .

          Possible values:

          o compliance

          o governance

       --cool-off-period (integer)
          The  cooling-off  period during which you can unlock the snapshot or
          modify the lock settings after locking the  snapshot  in  compliance
          mode,  in hours. After the cooling-off period expires, you can't un-
          lock or delete the snapshot, decrease the lock duration,  or  change
          the  lock  mode.  You can increase the lock duration after the cool-
          ing-off period expires.

          The cooling-off period is optional when locking a snapshot  in  com-
          pliance  mode.  If  you are locking the snapshot in governance mode,
          omit this parameter.

          To lock the snapshot in compliance mode immediately without a  cool-
          ing-off period, omit this parameter.

          If you are extending the lock duration for a snapshot that is locked
          in compliance mode after the cooling-off period  has  expired,  omit
          this parameter. If you specify a cooling-period in a such a request,
          the request fails.

          Allowed values: Min 1, max 72.

       --lock-duration (integer)
          The period of time for which to lock  the  snapshot,  in  days.  The
          snapshot lock will automatically expire after this period lapses.

          You  must  specify either this parameter or ExpirationDate , but not
          both.

          Allowed values: Min: 1, max 36500

       --expiration-date (timestamp)
          The date and time at which the snapshot lock is to automatically ex-
          pire, in the UTC time zone (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ ).

          You  must  specify  either  this parameter or LockDuration , but not
          both.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          The state of the snapshot lock. Valid states include:

          o compliance-cooloff - The snapshot has been  locked  in  compliance
            mode  but  it is still within the cooling-off period. The snapshot

            propriate permissions.

          o expired - The snapshot was locked in compliance or governance mode
            but  the lock duration has expired. The snapshot is not locked and
            can be deleted.
