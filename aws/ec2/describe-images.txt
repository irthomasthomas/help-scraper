DESCRIBE-IMAGES()                                            DESCRIBE-IMAGES()



NAME
       describe-images -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the specified images (AMIs, AKIs, and ARIs) available to you
       or all of the images available to you.

       The images available to you include public images, private images  that
       you own, and private images owned by other Amazon Web Services accounts
       for which you have explicit launch permissions.

       Recently deregistered images appear in the returned results for a short
       interval and then return empty results. After all instances that refer-
       ence a deregistered AMI are terminated, specifying the ID of the  image
       will  eventually  return  an error indicating that the AMI ID cannot be
       found.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-images is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Images

OPTIONS
       --executable-users (list)
          Scopes the images by users with explicit launch permissions. Specify
          an Amazon Web Services account ID, self (the sender of the request),
          or all (public AMIs).

          o If  you specify an Amazon Web Services account ID that is not your
            own, only AMIs shared with that specific Amazon Web  Services  ac-
            count  ID are returned. However, AMIs that are shared with the ac-
            counts organization or organizational unit (OU) are not returned.

          o If you specify self or your own Amazon Web  Services  account  ID,
            AMIs shared with your account are returned. In addition, AMIs that
            are shared with the organization or OU of which you are member are
            also returned.

          o If you specify all , all public AMIs are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o architecture - The image architecture (i386 | x86_64 | arm64 ).

          o block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination  - A Boolean value that
            indicates whether the Amazon EBS volume  is  deleted  on  instance
            termination.

          o block-device-mapping.device-name  -  The  device name specified in
            the block device mapping (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

          o block-device-mapping.snapshot-id - The ID of the snapshot used for
            the Amazon EBS volume.

          o block-device-mapping.volume-size  -  The volume size of the Amazon
            EBS volume, in GiB.

          o block-device-mapping.volume-type - The volume type of  the  Amazon
            EBS volume (io1 | io2 | gp2 | gp3 | sc1 | st1 | standard ).

          o block-device-mapping.encrypted  - A Boolean that indicates whether
            the Amazon EBS volume is encrypted.

          o creation-date - The time when the image was created,  in  the  ISO
            8601  format  in the UTC time zone (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ), for
            example, 2021-09-29T11:04:43.305Z . You can use a wildcard  (*  ),
            for example, 2021-09-29T* , which matches an entire day.

          o description  - The description of the image (provided during image
            creation).

          o ena-support - A Boolean that indicates whether enhanced networking
            with ENA is enabled.

          o hypervisor - The hypervisor type (ovm | xen ).

          o image-id - The ID of the image.

          o image-type - The image type (machine | kernel | ramdisk ).

          o is-public - A Boolean that indicates whether the image is public.

          o name - The name of the AMI (provided during image creation).

          o owner-alias  -  The  owner  alias (amazon | aws-marketplace ). The
            valid aliases are defined in an Amazon-maintained  list.  This  is
            not  the  Amazon  Web Services account alias that can be set using
            the IAM console. We recommend that you use the Owner  request  pa-
            rameter instead of this filter.

          o owner-id  -  The  Amazon  Web Services account ID of the owner. We
            recommend that you use the Owner request parameter instead of this
            filter.

          o platform - The platform. The only supported value is windows .

          o product-code - The product code.

          o product-code.type - The type of the product code (marketplace ).

          o ramdisk-id - The RAM disk ID.

            stance-store ).

          o state - The state of the image (available | pending | failed ).

          o state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change.

          o state-reason-message - The message for the state change.

          o sriov-net-support - A value of simple indicates that enhanced net-
            working with the Intel 82599 VF interface is enabled.

          o tag :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag  assigned  to  the
            resource.  Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
            the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have  a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter  to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o virtualization-type - The virtualization type (paravirtual  |  hvm
            ).

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --image-ids (list)
          The image IDs.

          Default: Describes all images available to you.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --owners (list)
          Scopes  the  results  to  images  with the specified owners. You can
          specify a combination of Amazon Web Services  account  IDs,  self  ,
          amazon  ,  and aws-marketplace . If you omit this parameter, the re-
          sults include all images for which you have launch permissions,  re-
          gardless of ownership.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include deprecated AMIs.

          Default: No deprecated AMIs are included in the response.

          NOTE:
              If  you are the AMI owner, all deprecated AMIs appear in the re-
              sponse regardless of what you specify for this parameter.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 2: To describe AMIs based on filters

       The following describe-images example describes Windows  AMIs  provided
       by Amazon that are backed by Amazon EBS.

          aws ec2 describe-images \
              --owners amazon \
              --filters "Name=platform,Values=windows" "Name=root-device-type,Values=ebs"

       For an example of the output for describe-images, see Example 1.

       For  additional  examples using filters, see Listing and filtering your
       resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 3: To describe AMIs based on tags

       The following describe-images example describes all AMIs that have  the
       tag Type=Custom. The example uses the --query parameter to display only
       the AMI IDs.

          aws ec2 describe-images \
              --filters "Name=tag:Type,Values=Custom" \
              --query 'Images[*].[ImageId]' \
              --output text

       Output:

          ami-1234567890EXAMPLE
          ami-0abcdef1234567890

       For additional examples using tag filters, see Working with tags in the
       Amazon EC2 User Guide.

                 The operation of the Amazon EC2 instance and the billing code
                 that is associated with the AMI.  usageOperation  corresponds
                 to  the lineitem/Operation column on your Amazon Web Services
                 Cost and Usage Report and in the Amazon  Web  Services  Price
                 List API . You can view these fields on the Instances or AMIs
                 pages in the Amazon EC2 console, or in the responses that are
                 returned by the DescribeImages command in the Amazon EC2 API,
                 or the describe-images command in the CLI.

              ProductCodes -> (list)
                 Any product codes associated with the AMI.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a product code.

                     ProductCodeId -> (string)
                        The product code.

                     ProductCodeType -> (string)
                        The type of product code.

              RamdiskId -> (string)
                 The RAM disk associated with the image, if any. Only applica-
                 ble for machine images.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the AMI. If the state is available , the
                 image is successfully registered and can be used to launch an
                 instance.

              BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)
                 Any block device mapping entries.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  a  block device mapping, which defines the EBS
                     volumes and instance store volumes to attach  to  an  in-
                     stance at launch.

                     DeviceName -> (string)
                        The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                     VirtualName -> (string)
                        The  virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store
                        volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type
                        with  2  available  instance store volumes can specify
                        mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of
                        available  instance  store  volumes depends on the in-
                        stance type. After you connect to  the  instance,  you
                        must mount the volume.

                        NVMe  instance store volumes are automatically enumer-
                        ated and assigned a device  name.  Including  them  in
                        your block device mapping has no effect.

                        Constraints:  For  M3  instances, you must specify in-
                        stance store volumes in the block device  mapping  for
                        the  instance.  When you launch an M3 instance, we ig-
                        nore any instance store volumes specified in the block
                        device mapping for the AMI.

                     Ebs -> (structure)
                        Parameters  used  to  automatically set up EBS volumes
                        when the instance is launched.

                        DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on in-
                            stance  termination.  For  more  information,  see
                            Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termina-
                            tion in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                        Iops -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  I/O operations per second (IOPS).
                            For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes,  this  represents
                            the  number  of  IOPS that are provisioned for the
                            volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the base-
                            line  performance  of  the  volume and the rate at
                            which  the  volume  accumulates  I/O  credits  for
                            bursting.

                            The  following  are  the supported values for each
                            volume type:

                            o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                            o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                            o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                            For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000  IOPS
                            only  for  Instances  built  on the Nitro System .
                            Other instance families guarantee  performance  up
                            to 32,000 IOPS.

                            This  parameter  is  required for io1 and io2 vol-
                            umes. The default for gp3 volumes is  3,000  IOPS.
                            This  parameter  is  not supported for gp2 , st1 ,
                            sc1 , or standard volumes.

                        SnapshotId -> (string)
                            The ID of the snapshot.

                        VolumeSize -> (integer)
                            The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must  specify
                            either  a  snapshot  ID  or  a volume size. If you
                            specify a snapshot, the default  is  the  snapshot
                            size.  You can specify a volume size that is equal
                            to or larger than the snapshot size.

                            The following are the supported volumes sizes  for
                            each volume type:

                            o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                            o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                            o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                            o standard : 1-1,024

                        VolumeType -> (string)
                            The  volume type. For more information, see Amazon
                            EBS volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . If
                            the  volume  type is io1 or io2 , you must specify
                            the IOPS that the volume supports.

                        KmsKeyId -> (string)
                            Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID  ARN,  or  alias
                            ARN)  for  a  customer managed CMK under which the
                            EBS volume is encrypted.

                            This  parameter  is  only  supported  on  BlockDe-
                            viceMapping   objects  called  by  RunInstances  ,
                            RequestSpotFleet , and RequestSpotInstances .

                        Throughput -> (integer)
                            The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                            This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                            Valid Range: Minimum value of 125.  Maximum  value
                            of 1000.

                        OutpostArn -> (string)
                            The  ARN  of  the Outpost on which the snapshot is
                            stored.

                            This  parameter  is  only  supported  on  BlockDe-
                            viceMapping objects called by CreateImage .

                        Encrypted -> (boolean)
                            Indicates  whether  the encryption state of an EBS
                            volume is changed  while  being  restored  from  a
                            backing  snapshot.  The  effect of setting the en-
                            cryption state to true depends on the volume  ori-
                            gin  (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption
                            state, ownership, and whether  encryption  by  de-
                            fault is enabled. For more information, see Amazon
                            EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                            In no case can you remove encryption from  an  en-
                            crypted volume.

                            Encrypted  volumes  can  only  be  attached to in-
                            stances that support Amazon  EBS  encryption.  For
                            more information, see Supported instance types .

                            This  parameter  is  not  returned by  DescribeIm-
                            ageAttribute .

                            For  CreateImage and  RegisterImage , whether  you
                            can include this parameter, and the allowed values
                            differ depending on the type of block device  map-
                            ping you are creating.

                            o If you are creating a block device mapping for a
                              new (empty) volume , you can include this param-
                              eter,  and  specify either true for an encrypted
                              volume, or false for an unencrypted  volume.  If
                              you  omit  this  parameter, it defaults to false
                              (unencrypted).

                            o If you are creating a block device mapping  from
                              an  existing encrypted or unencrypted snapshot ,
                              you must omit this  parameter.  If  you  include
                              this  parameter,  the request will fail, regard-
                              less of the value that you specify.

                            o If you are creating a block device mapping  from
                              an existing unencrypted volume , you can include
                              this parameter, but you must specify false .  If
                              you  specify  true  ,  the request will fail. In
                              this case, we recommend that you omit the param-
                              eter.

                            o If  you are creating a block device mapping from
                              an existing encrypted volume , you  can  include
                              this parameter, and specify either true or false
                              . However, if you specify false , the  parameter
                              is  ignored  and the block device mapping is al-
                              ways encrypted. In this case, we recommend  that
                              you omit the parameter.

                     NoDevice -> (string)
                        To  omit  the  device  from  the block device mapping,
                        specify an empty string. When this property is  speci-
                        fied, the device is removed from the block device map-
                        ping regardless of the assigned value.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the AMI that  was  provided  during  image
                 creation.

              EnaSupport -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether enhanced networking with ENA is enabled.

              Hypervisor -> (string)

              ImageOwnerAlias -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services account alias (for example, amazon ,
                 self ) or the Amazon Web  Services  account  ID  of  the  AMI
                 owner.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the AMI that was provided during image creation.

              RootDeviceName -> (string)
                 The  device  name  of  the  root  device volume (for example,
                 /dev/sda1 ).

              RootDeviceType -> (string)
                 The type of root device used by the AMI. The AMI can  use  an
                 Amazon EBS volume or an instance store volume.

              SriovNetSupport -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  enhanced  networking with the Intel 82599
                 Virtual Function interface is enabled.

                       available  capacity  or  because  of an increase in the
                       Spot price.

                     o Server.SpotInstanceTermination : The instance was  ter-
                       minated because the number of Spot requests with a max-
                       imum price equal to or higher than the Spot  price  ex-
                       ceeded  available capacity or because of an increase in
                       the Spot price.

                     o Client.InstanceInitiatedShutdown  :  The  instance  was
                       shut  down  using  the shutdown -h command from the in-
                       stance.

                     o Client.InstanceTerminated : The instance was terminated
                       or rebooted during AMI creation.

                     o Client.InternalError  :  A  client error caused the in-
                       stance to terminate during launch.

                     o Client.InvalidSnapshot.NotFound : The  specified  snap-
                       shot was not found.

                     o Client.UserInitiatedHibernate  : Hibernation was initi-
                       ated on the instance.

                     o Client.UserInitiatedShutdown : The  instance  was  shut
                       down using the Amazon EC2 API.

                     o Client.VolumeLimitExceeded : The limit on the number of
                       EBS volumes or total storage was exceeded. Decrease us-
