DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  quote  and  exchange information for exchanging one or more
       specified Convertible Reserved Instances for a new Convertible Reserved
       Instance.  If  the exchange cannot be performed, the reason is returned
       in the response. Use  AcceptReservedInstancesExchangeQuote  to  perform
       the exchange.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --reserved-instance-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Convertible Reserved Instances to exchange.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --target-configurations (list)
          The configuration of the target Convertible Reserved Instance to ex-
          change for your current Convertible Reserved Instances.

          (structure)
              Details about the target configuration.

              InstanceCount -> (integer)
                 The number of instances the Convertible Reserved Instance of-
                 fering can be applied to. This parameter is reserved and can-
                 not be specified in a request

              OfferingId -> (string)
                 The Convertible Reserved Instance offering ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InstanceCount=integer,OfferingId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InstanceCount": integer,
              "OfferingId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
