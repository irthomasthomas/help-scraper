IMAGE-AVAILABLE()                                            IMAGE-AVAILABLE()



NAME
       image-available -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait until JMESPath query Images[].State returns available for all ele-
       ments when polling with describe-images. It will poll every 15  seconds
       until a successful state has been reached. This will exit with a return
       code of 255 after 40 failed checks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       image-available is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Images

OPTIONS
       --executable-users (list)
          Scopes the images by users with explicit launch permissions. Specify
          an Amazon Web Services account ID, self (the sender of the request),
          or all (public AMIs).

          o If  you specify an Amazon Web Services account ID that is not your
            own, only AMIs shared with that specific Amazon Web  Services  ac-
            count  ID are returned. However, AMIs that are shared with the ac-
            counts organization or organizational unit (OU) are not returned.

          o If you specify self or your own Amazon Web  Services  account  ID,
            AMIs shared with your account are returned. In addition, AMIs that
            are shared with the organization or OU of which you are member are
            also returned.

          o If you specify all , all public AMIs are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          "string" "string" ...

       --owners (list)
          Scopes  the  results  to  images  with the specified owners. You can
          specify a combination of Amazon Web Services  account  IDs,  self  ,
          amazon  ,  aws-backup-vault , and aws-marketplace . If you omit this
          parameter, the results include all images for which you have  launch
          permissions, regardless of ownership.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include deprecated AMIs.

          Default: No deprecated AMIs are included in the response.

          NOTE:
              If  you are the AMI owner, all deprecated AMIs appear in the re-
              sponse regardless of what you specify for this parameter.

       --include-disabled | --no-include-disabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include disabled AMIs.

          Default: No disabled AMIs are included in the response.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o architecture  -  The  image  architecture (i386 | x86_64 | arm64 |

            indicates  whether  the  Amazon  EBS volume is deleted on instance
            termination.

          o block-device-mapping.device-name - The device  name  specified  in
            the block device mapping (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

          o block-device-mapping.snapshot-id - The ID of the snapshot used for
            the Amazon EBS volume.

          o block-device-mapping.volume-size - The volume size of  the  Amazon
            EBS volume, in GiB.

            alias that can be set using the IAM console. We recommend that you
            use the Owner request parameter instead of this filter.

          o owner-id  -  The  Amazon  Web Services account ID of the owner. We
            recommend that you use the Owner request parameter instead of this
            filter.

          o source-instance-id - The ID of the instance that the AMI was  cre-
            ated from if the AMI was created using CreateImage. This filter is
            applicable only if the AMI was created using CreateImage .

          o state - The state of the image (available | pending | failed ).

          o state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change.

          o state-reason-message - The message for the state change.

          o sriov-net-support - A value of simple indicates that enhanced net-

          o tag:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the re-
            source. Use the tag key in the filter name and the  tag  value  as
            the  filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a

            ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,  re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o virtualization-type  -  The virtualization type (paravirtual | hvm
            ).

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To wait until an image is available

       The following wait image-available example pauses and  resumes  running
       only  after  it  confirms  that  the  specified Amazon Machine Image is
       available. It produces no output.

          aws ec2 wait image-available \
              --image-ids ami-0abcdef1234567890

OUTPUT
       None
