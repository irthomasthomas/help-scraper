INSTANCE-STATUS-OK()                                      INSTANCE-STATUS-OK()



NAME
       instance-status-ok -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until JMESPath query InstanceStatuses[].InstanceStatus.Status re-
       turns ok for all elements when polling  with  describe-instance-status.
       It  will  poll  every  15  seconds  until  a  successful state has been
       reached. This will exit with a return  code  of  255  after  40  failed
       checks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       instance-status-ok  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: InstanceStatuses

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o availability-zone - The Availability Zone of the instance.

          o event.code - The code for the scheduled event  (instance-reboot  |
            system-reboot  |  system-maintenance  |  instance-retirement | in-
            stance-stop ).

          o event.description - A description of the event.

          o event.instance-event-id - The ID of the event whose date and  time
            you are modifying.

          o event.not-after - The latest end time for the scheduled event (for
            example, 2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z ).

          o event.not-before - The earliest start time for the scheduled event
            (for example, 2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z ).

          o event.not-before-deadline  -  The  deadline for starting the event
            (for example, 2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z ).

          o instance-state-code - The code for the instance state, as a 16-bit
            unsigned  integer. The high byte is used for internal purposes and
            should be ignored. The low byte is set based on the  state  repre-
            sented.  The valid values are 0 (pending), 16 (running), 32 (shut-
            ting-down), 48 (terminated), 64 (stopping), and 80 (stopped).

          o instance-state-name - The state of the instance (pending | running
            | shutting-down | terminated | stopping | stopped ).

          o instance-status.reachability  -  Filters  on instance status where
            the name is reachability (passed | failed | initializing |  insuf-
            ficient-data ).

          o instance-status.status - The status of the instance (ok | impaired
            | initializing | insufficient-data | not-applicable ).

          o system-status.reachability - Filters on system  status  where  the
            name  is  reachability  (passed | failed | initializing | insuffi-
            cient-data ).

          o system-status.status - The system status of the instance (ok | im-
            paired | initializing | insufficient-data | not-applicable ).

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --instance-ids (list)
          The instance IDs.

          Default: Describes all your instances.

          Constraints: Maximum 100 explicitly specified instance IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --include-all-instances | --no-include-all-instances (boolean)
          When true , includes the health status for all instances. When false
          , includes the health status for running instances only.

          Default: false

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To wait until the status of an instance is OK

       The following wait instance-status-ok example pauses and  resumes  run-
       ning  only  after it confirms that the status of the specified instance
       is OK. It produces no output.

          aws ec2 wait instance-status-ok \
              --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0

OUTPUT
       None



                                                          INSTANCE-STATUS-OK()
