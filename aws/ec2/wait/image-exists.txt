NAME
       image-exists -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until  JMESPath  query  length(Images[])  >  0  returns True when
       polling with describe-images. It will poll every  15  seconds  until  a
       successful state has been reached. This will exit with a return code of
       255 after 40 failed checks.

OPTIONS
       --executable-users (list)
          Scopes the images by users with explicit launch permissions. Specify
          an Amazon Web Services account ID, self (the sender of the request),
          or all (public AMIs).

          o If you specify an Amazon Web Services account ID that is not  your
            own,  only  AMIs shared with that specific Amazon Web Services ac-
            count ID are returned. However, AMIs that are shared with the  ac-
            counts organization or organizational unit (OU) are not returned.

          o If  you  specify  self or your own Amazon Web Services account ID,
            AMIs shared with your account are returned. In addition, AMIs that
            are shared with the organization or OU of which you are member are
            also returned.

          o If you specify all , all public AMIs are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o architecture - The image architecture (i386 | x86_64 | arm64 ).

          o block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination - A Boolean value  that
            indicates  whether  the  Amazon  EBS volume is deleted on instance
            termination.

          o block-device-mapping.device-name - The device  name  specified  in
            the block device mapping (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

          o block-device-mapping.snapshot-id - The ID of the snapshot used for
            the Amazon EBS volume.

          o block-device-mapping.volume-size - The volume size of  the  Amazon
            EBS volume, in GiB.

          o block-device-mapping.volume-type  -  The volume type of the Amazon
            EBS volume (io1 | io2 | gp2 | gp3 | sc1 | st1 | standard ).

          o block-device-mapping.encrypted - A Boolean that indicates  whether
            the Amazon EBS volume is encrypted.

          o creation-date  -  The  time when the image was created, in the ISO
            8601 format in the UTC time zone  (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ),  for
            example,  2021-09-29T11:04:43.305Z  . You can use a wildcard (* ),
            for example, 2021-09-29T* , which matches an entire day.

          o description - The description of the image (provided during  image
            creation).

          o ena-support - A Boolean that indicates whether enhanced networking
            with ENA is enabled.

          o hypervisor - The hypervisor type (ovm | xen ).

          o image-id - The ID of the image.

          o image-type - The image type (machine | kernel | ramdisk ).

          o is-public - A Boolean that indicates whether the image is public.

          o kernel-id - The kernel ID.

          o manifest-location - The location of the image manifest.

          o name - The name of the AMI (provided during image creation).

          o owner-alias - The owner alias (amazon  |  aws-marketplace  ).  The
            valid  aliases  are  defined in an Amazon-maintained list. This is
            not the Amazon Web Services account alias that can  be  set  using
            the  IAM  console. We recommend that you use the Owner request pa-
            rameter instead of this filter.

          o owner-id - The Amazon Web Services account ID  of  the  owner.  We
            recommend that you use the Owner request parameter instead of this
            filter.

          o platform - The platform. The only supported value is windows .

          o product-code - The product code.

          o product-code.type - The type of the product code (marketplace ).

          o ramdisk-id - The RAM disk ID.

            stance-store ).

          o state - The state of the image (available | pending | failed ).

          o state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change.

          o state-reason-message - The message for the state change.

          o sriov-net-support - A value of simple indicates that enhanced net-
            working with the Intel 82599 VF interface is enabled.

          o tag  :<key>  -  The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
            resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as
            the  filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,  re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o virtualization-type  -  The virtualization type (paravirtual | hvm
            ).

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --image-ids (list)
          The image IDs.

          Default: Describes all images available to you.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --owners (list)
          Scopes the results to images with  the  specified  owners.  You  can
          specify  a  combination  of  Amazon Web Services account IDs, self ,
          amazon , and aws-marketplace . If you omit this parameter,  the  re-
          sults  include all images for which you have launch permissions, re-
          gardless of ownership.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include deprecated AMIs.

          Default: No deprecated AMIs are included in the response.

          NOTE:
              If you are the AMI owner, all deprecated AMIs appear in the  re-
              sponse regardless of what you specify for this parameter.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To wait until an image exists

       The following wait image-exists example pauses and resumes running only
       after  it  confirms  that the specified Amazon Machine Image exists. It
       produces no output.

          aws ec2 wait image-exists \
              --image-ids ami-0abcdef1234567890

OUTPUT
       None
