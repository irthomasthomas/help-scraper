VPC-EXISTS()                                                      VPC-EXISTS()



NAME
       vpc-exists -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait until 200 response is received when polling with describe-vpcs. It
       will poll every 1 seconds until a successful state  has  been  reached.
       This will exit with a return code of 255 after 5 failed checks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       vpc-exists  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Vpcs

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o cidr - The primary IPv4 CIDR block of the VPC. The CIDR block  you
            specify must exactly match the VPC's CIDR block for information to
            be returned for the VPC. Must contain the slash followed by one or
            two digits (for example, /28 ).

          o cidr-block-association.cidr-block  - An IPv4 CIDR block associated
            with the VPC.

          o cidr-block-association.association-id - The association ID for  an
            IPv4 CIDR block associated with the VPC.

          o cidr-block-association.state - The state of an IPv4 CIDR block as-
            sociated with the VPC.

          o dhcp-options-id - The ID of a set of DHCP options.

          o ipv6-cidr-block-association.ipv6-cidr-block - An IPv6  CIDR  block
            associated with the VPC.

          o ipv6-cidr-block-association.ipv6-pool - The ID of the IPv6 address
            pool from which the IPv6 CIDR block is allocated.

          o ipv6-cidr-block-association.association-id -  The  association  ID
            for an IPv6 CIDR block associated with the VPC.

          o ipv6-cidr-block-association.state  -  The  state  of  an IPv6 CIDR
            block associated with the VPC.

          o is-default - Indicates whether the VPC is the default VPC.

          o owner-id - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
            VPC.

          o state - The state of the VPC (pending | available ).

          o tag - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
            Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter
            value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the
            key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for  the  filter
            name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,  re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o vpc-id - The ID of the VPC.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --vpc-ids (list)
          The IDs of the VPCs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To wait until a virtual private cloud (VPC) exists

       The following wait vpc-exists example command pauses and  resumes  run-
       ning only after it confirms that the specified VPC exists.

          aws ec2 wait vpc-exists \
              --vpc-ids vpc-1234567890abcdef0

OUTPUT
       None
