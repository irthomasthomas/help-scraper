CREATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()                            CREATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()



NAME
       create-customer-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information to Amazon Web Services about your customer gateway
       device. The customer gateway device is the appliance at your end of the
       VPN connection. You must provide the IP address of the customer gateway
       devices external interface. The IP address must be static  and  can  be
       behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).

       For  devices  that use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), you can also pro-
       vide the device's BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN). You  can  use  an
       existing  ASN  assigned  to  your network. If you don't have an ASN al-
       ready, you can use a private ASN. For more  information,  see  Customer
       gateway  options for your Site-to-Site VPN connection in the Amazon Web
       Services Site-to-Site VPN User Guide .

       To create more than one customer gateway with the same VPN type, IP ad-
       dress,  and  BGP  ASN,  specify  a unique device name for each customer
       gateway. An identical request returns information  about  the  existing
       customer gateway; it doesn't create a new customer gateway.

OPTIONS
       --bgp-asn (integer)
          For devices that support BGP, the customer gateway's BGP ASN.

          Default: 65000

       --public-ip (string)
          This  member  has  been deprecated. The Internet-routable IP address
          for the customer gateway's outside interface. The  address  must  be
          static.

       --certificate-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the customer gateway certificate.

       --type (string)
          The  type  of  VPN  connection  that  this customer gateway supports
          (ipsec.1 ).

          Possible values:

          o ipsec.1

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to apply to the customer gateway.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated.

              NOTE:
                 The  Valid  Values  lists  all the resource types that can be
                 tagged. However, the action you're using  might  not  support
                 tagging  all of these resource types. If you try to tag a re-
                 source type that is unsupported for the action you're  using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

       --device-name (string)
          A name for the customer gateway device.

          Length Constraints: Up to 255 characters.

       --ip-address (string)
          IPv4 address for the customer gateway  device's  outside  interface.
          The address must be static.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
