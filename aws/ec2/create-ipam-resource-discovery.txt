OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --description (string)
          A description for the IPAM resource discovery.

       --operating-regions (list)
          Operating Regions for the IPAM resource discovery. Operating Regions
          are  Amazon Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage
          IP address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in  the
          Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

          (structure)
              Add an operating Region to an IPAM. Operating Regions are Amazon
              Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage IP  ad-
              dress  CIDRs.  IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in the
              Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

              For more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM
              in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the operating Region.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegionName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tag-specifications (list)
          Tag specifications for the IPAM resource discovery.

          (structure)
              The  tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being cre-
              ated. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type
              to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

              NOTE:
                 The  Valid  Values  lists  all the resource types that can be
                 tagged. However, the action you're using  might  not  support
                 tagging  all of these resource types. If you try to tag a re-
                 source type that is unsupported for the action you're  using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          A client token for the IPAM resource discovery.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a resource discovery

       In  this example, you're a delegated IPAM admin who wants to create and
       share a resource discovery with the IPAM admin in another AWS Organiza-
       tion so that the admin in the other organization can manage and monitor
       the IP addresses of resources in your organization.

       Important

       o This example includes both the --region and  --operating-regions  op-
         tions  because, while they are optional, they must be configured in a
         particular way to successfully integrate a resource discovery with an
         IPAM.   *  --operating-regions  must match the Regions where you have
         resources that you want IPAM to discover. If there are Regions  where
         you do not want IPAM to manage the IP addresses (for example for com-
         pliance reasons), do not include them.  *  --region  must  match  the
         home  Region of the IPAM you want to associate it with. You must cre-
         ate the resource discovery in the same Region that the IPAM was  cre-
         ated  in.  For example, if the IPAM you are associating with was cre-
         ated in us-east-1, include --region us-east-1 in the request.

       o Both the --region and --operating-regions options default to the  Re-
         gion you're running the command in if you don't specify them.

       In  this  example,  the operating Regions of the IPAM we're integrating
       with include us-west-1, us-west-2, and ap-south-1. When we  create  the
       resource  discovery, we want IPAM to discover the resource IP addresses
       in us-west-1 and us-west-2 but not ap-south-1. So we are including only
       --operating-regions  RegionName='us-west-1'  RegionName='us-west-2'  in
       the request.

       The following create-ipam-resource-discovery example  creates  an  IPAM
       resource discovery.

          aws ec2 create-ipam-resource-discovery \
              --description 'Example-resource-discovery' \
              --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=ipam-resource-discovery,Tags=[{Key=cost-center,Value=cc123}]' \
              --operating-regions RegionName='us-west-1' RegionName='us-west-2' \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "IpamResourceDiscovery":{
                  "OwnerId": "149977607591",
                  "IpamResourceDiscoveryId": "ipam-res-disco-0257046d8aa78b8bc",
                  "IpamResourceDiscoveryArn": "arn:aws:ec2::149977607591:ipam-resource-discovery/ipam-res-disco-0257046d8aa78b8bc",
                  "IpamResourceDiscoveryRegion": "us-east-1",
                  "Description": "'Example-resource-discovery'",
                  "OperatingRegions":[
                      {"RegionName": "us-west-1"},
                      {"RegionName": "us-west-2"},
                      {"RegionName": "us-east-1"}
                  ],
                  "IsDefault": false,
                  "State": "create-in-progress",
                  "Tags": [
                      {
                          "Key": "cost-center",
                          "Value": "cc123"
                      }
                  ]
          }

       Once you create a resource discovery, you may want to share it with an-
       other   IPAM   delegated    admin,    which    you    can    do    with
       create-resource-share.  For  more  information, see Integrate IPAM with
       accounts outside of your organization  in  the  Amazon  VPC  IPAM  User
       Guide.
