DISABLE-FAST-LAUNCH()                                    DISABLE-FAST-LAUNCH()



NAME
       disable-fast-launch -

DESCRIPTION
       Discontinue  faster  launching for a Windows AMI, and clean up existing
       pre-provisioned snapshots. When you disable faster launching,  the  AMI
       uses the standard launch process for each instance. All pre-provisioned
       snapshots must be removed before you can enable faster launching again.

       NOTE:
          To change these settings, you must own the AMI.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-fast-launch
          --image-id <value>
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-id (string)
          The ID of the image for which youre turning  off  faster  launching,
          and removing pre-provisioned snapshots.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          Forces the image settings to turn off faster launching for your Win-
          dows AMI. This parameter overrides any errors that  are  encountered
          while cleaning up resources in your account.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To discontinue fast launching for an image

       The following disable-fast-launch example discontinues  fast  launching
       on the specified AMI, and cleans up existing pre-provisioned snapshots.

          aws ec2 disable-fast-launch \
              --image-id ami-01234567890abcedf

       Output:

          {

          LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
              The  ID of the launch template for faster launching of the asso-
              ciated Windows AMI.

              The name of the launch template for faster launching of the  as-
              sociated Windows AMI.

          Version -> (string)
              The  version  of the launch template for faster launching of the
