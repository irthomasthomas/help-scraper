ENABLE-SNAPSHOT-BLOCK-PUBLIC-ACCESS()    ENABLE-SNAPSHOT-BLOCK-PUBLIC-ACCESS()



NAME
       enable-snapshot-block-public-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  or  modifies  the block public access for snapshots setting at
       the account level for the specified Amazon Web Services  Region.  After
       you  enable block public access for snapshots in a Region, users can no
       longer request public sharing for snapshots in that  Region.  Snapshots
       that  are already publicly shared are either treated as private or they
       remain publicly shared, depending on the State that you specify.

       If block public access is enabled in block-all-sharing  mode,  and  you
       change  the  mode to block-new-sharing , all snapshots that were previ-
       ously publicly shared are no longer treated as private and they  become
       publicly accessible again.

       For more information, see Block public access for snapshots in the Ama-
       zon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --state (string)
          The mode in which to enable block public access  for  snapshots  for
          the Region. Specify one of the following values:

          o block-all-sharing  -  Prevents  all public sharing of snapshots in
            the Region. Users in the account will no longer be able to request
            new  public sharing. Additionally, snapshots that are already pub-
            licly shared are treated as private and they are  no  longer  pub-
            licly available.

          NOTE:
              If   you   enable   block   public   access   for  snapshots  in
              block-all-sharing mode, it does not change the  permissions  for
              snapshots that are already publicly shared. Instead, it prevents
              these snapshots from be publicly visible and  publicly  accessi-
              ble.  Therefore,  the attributes for these snapshots still indi-
              cate that they are publicly shared, even  though  they  are  not
              publicly available.

          o block-new-sharing  - Prevents only new public sharing of snapshots
            in the Region. Users in the account will no longer be able to  re-
            quest new public sharing. However, snapshots that are already pub-
            licly shared, remain publicly available.
              unblocked is not a valid value for  EnableSnapshotBlockPublicAc-
              cess .

          Possible values:

          o block-all-sharing

          o block-new-sharing

          o unblocked

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       State -> (string)
          The  state  of block public access for snapshots for the account and
          Region. Returns either block-all-sharing or block-new-sharing if the
          request succeeds.
