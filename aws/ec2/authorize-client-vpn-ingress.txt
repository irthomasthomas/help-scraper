AUTHORIZE-CLIENT-VPN-INGRESS()                  AUTHORIZE-CLIENT-VPN-INGRESS()



NAME
       authorize-client-vpn-ingress -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  an  ingress  authorization rule to a Client VPN endpoint. Ingress
       authorization rules act as firewall rules that  grant  access  to  net-
       works. You must configure ingress authorization rules to enable clients
       to access resources in Amazon Web Services or on-premises networks.

OPTIONS
       --client-vpn-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the Client VPN endpoint.

       --target-network-cidr (string)
          The IPv4 address range, in CIDR notation, of the network  for  which
          access is being authorized.

       --access-group-id (string)
          The  ID of the group to grant access to, for example, the Active Di-
          rectory group or identity provider (IdP) group. Required  if  Autho-
          rizeAllGroups is false or not specified.

       --authorize-all-groups | --no-authorize-all-groups (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  to  grant access to all clients. Specify true to
          grant all clients who successfully establish a VPN connection access
          to  the  network. Must be set to true if AccessGroupId is not speci-
          fied.

       --description (string)
          A brief description of the authorization rule.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensuring idem-
          potency .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To add an authorization rule for a Client VPN endpoint

       The  following authorize-client-vpn-ingress example adds an ingress au-
       thorization rule that  permits  all  clients  to  access  the  internet
       (0.0.0.0/0).

          aws ec2 authorize-client-vpn-ingress \
              --client-vpn-endpoint-id cvpn-endpoint-123456789123abcde \
              --target-network-cidr 0.0.0.0/0 \
              --authorize-all-groups

       Output:

          {
              "Status": {
                  "Code": "authorizing"
              }
          }

       For more information, see Authorization Rules in the AWS Client VPN Ad-
       ministrator Guide.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (structure)
          The current state of the authorization rule.

          Code -> (string)
              The state of the authorization rule.

          Message -> (string)
              A message about the status of the authorization rule, if  appli-
              cable.
