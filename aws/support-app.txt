NAME
       support-app -

DESCRIPTION
       You  can use the Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack API to manage
       your support cases in Slack for your Amazon Web Services account. After
       you configure your Slack workspace and channel with the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Support App, you can perform the following tasks directly in your
       Slack channel:

       o Create, search, update, and resolve your support cases

       o Request service quota increases for your account

       o Invite Amazon Web Services Support agents to your channel so that you
         can chat directly about your support cases

       For more information about how to perform these actions in  Slack,  see
       the  following  documentation  in  the Amazon Web Services Support User
       Guide :

       o Joining a live chat session with Amazon Web Services Support

       o Requesting service quota increases

       o Amazon Web Services Support App commands in Slack

       You can also use the Amazon Web Services Management Console instead  of
       the Amazon Web Services Support App API to manage your Slack configura-
       tions. For more information, see Authorize a Slack workspace to  enable
       the Amazon Web Services Support App .
