NAME
       list-shared-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all endpoints associated with an Outpost that has been shared by
       Amazon Web Services Resource Access Manager (RAM).

       Related actions include:

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-shared-endpoints is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Endpoints

SYNOPSIS
            list-shared-endpoints
          --outpost-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --outpost-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services Outpost.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Endpoints -> (list)
          The  list  of  endpoints  associated with the specified Outpost that

              Amazon  S3  on Outposts Access Points simplify managing data ac-
              cess at scale for shared datasets in S3 on Outposts. S3 on  Out-
              posts  uses endpoints to connect to Outposts buckets so that you
              can perform actions within your virtual private cloud (VPC). For
              more  information,  see  Accessing S3 on Outposts using VPC-only
              access points in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

              EndpointArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint.

              OutpostsId -> (string)

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the endpoint.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the endpoint was created.

              NetworkInterfaces -> (list)
                 The network interface of the endpoint.

                 (structure)
                     The container for the network interface.

                     NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                        The ID for the network interface.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC used for the endpoint.

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the subnet used for the endpoint.

              SecurityGroupId -> (string)
                 The ID of the security group used for the endpoint.

              AccessType -> (string)
                 The type of connectivity used to access the Amazon S3 on Out-
                 posts endpoint.

              CustomerOwnedIpv4Pool -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the customer-owned IPv4 address pool used for the
                 endpoint.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the number of endpoints associated with the specified Outpost ex-
          ceeds MaxResults , you can include this value in subsequent calls to
          this operation to retrieve more results.
