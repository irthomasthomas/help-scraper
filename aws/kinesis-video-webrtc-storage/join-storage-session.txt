JOIN-STORAGE-SESSION()                                  JOIN-STORAGE-SESSION()



NAME
       join-storage-session -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          Before using this API, you must call the GetSignalingChannelEndpoint
          API to request the WEBRTC endpoint. You then  specify  the  endpoint
          and region in your JoinStorageSession API request.

       Join the ongoing one way-video and/or multi-way audio WebRTC session as
       a video producing device for an input channel. If  theres  no  existing
       session  for  the channel, a new streaming session needs to be created,
       and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  signaling  channel  must  be
       provided.

       Currently  for the SINGLE_MASTER type, a video producing device is able
       to ingest both audio and video media into a stream. Only video  produc-
       ing devices can join the session and record media.

       WARNING:
          Both audio and video tracks are currently required for WebRTC inges-
          tion.

          Current requirements:

          o Video track: H.264

          o Audio track: Opus

       The resulting ingested video in the Kinesis video stream will have  the
       following parameters: H.264 video and AAC audio.

       Once  a  master participant has negotiated a connection through WebRTC,
       the ingested media session will be stored in the Kinesis video  stream.
       Multiple viewers are then able to play back real-time media through our
       Playback APIs.

       You can also use existing Kinesis Video Streams features  like  HLS  or
       DASH  playback, image generation via GetImages , and more with ingested
       WebRTC media.

       NOTE:
          S3 image delivery and notifications are not currently supported.

       NOTE:
              Assume that only one video producing device client can be  asso-
              ciated  with  a session for the channel. If more than one client
              joins the session of a specific channel as a video producing de-
              vice, the most recent client request takes precedence.

          Additional information

       o Idempotent - This API is not idempotent.

       o Retry behavior - This is counted as a new API call.

       o Concurrent  calls  -  Concurrent  calls are allowed. An offer is sent
         once per each call.

          --channel-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the signaling channel.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       None
