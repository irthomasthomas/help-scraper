JOIN-STORAGE-SESSION()                                  JOIN-STORAGE-SESSION()



NAME
       join-storage-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Join the ongoing one way-video and/or multi-way audio WebRTC session as
       a video producing device for an input channel. If  theres  no  existing
       session  for  the channel, a new streaming session needs to be created,
       and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  signaling  channel  must  be
       provided.

       Currently  for the SINGLE_MASTER type, a video producing device is able
       to ingest both audio and video media into a stream, while  viewers  can
       only  ingest  audio. Both a video producing device and viewers can join
       the session first, and wait for other participants.

       While participants are having peer to peer  conversations  through  we-
       bRTC,  the ingested media session will be stored into the Kinesis Video
       Stream. Multiple viewers are able to playback real-time media.

       Customers can also use existing Kinesis Video Streams features like HLS
       or  DASH  playback, Image generation, and more with ingested WebRTC me-
       dia.

       NOTE:
          Assume that only one video producing device client can be associated
          with  a  session  for the channel. If more than one client joins the
          session of a specific channel as a video producing device, the  most
          recent client request takes precedence.

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the signaling channel.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
