OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          Specifies  the 12-digit account ID number of the Amazon Web Services
          account that you want to access or modify with  this  operation.  If
          you don't specify this parameter, it defaults to the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account of the identity used to call  the  operation.  To  use
          this parameter, the caller must be an identity in the organization's
          management account or a delegated administrator account. The  speci-
          fied  account ID must also be a member account in the same organiza-
          tion. The organization must have all features enabled , and the  or-
          ganization  must have trusted access enabled for the Account Manage-
          ment service, and optionally a delegated admin account assigned.

          NOTE:
              The management account can't specify its own AccountId . It must
              call  the  operation  in standalone context by not including the
              AccountId parameter.

          To call this operation on an account that is not a member of an  or-
          ganization,  don't  specify this parameter. Instead, call the opera-
          tion using an identity belonging to the account whose  contacts  you
          wish to retrieve or modify.

       --region-name (string)
          Specifies  the  Region-code  for  a  given Region name (for example,
          af-south-1 ). When you disable a Region, AWS performs actions to de-
          activate  that  Region  in  your account, such as destroying IAM re-
          sources in the Region. This process takes a few minutes for most ac-
          counts,  but  this can take several hours. You cannot enable the Re-
          gion until the disabling process is fully completed.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
