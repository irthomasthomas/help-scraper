OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          Specifies  the 12-digit account ID number of the Amazon Web Services
          account that you want to access or modify with  this  operation.  If
          you don't specify this parameter, it defaults to the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account of the identity used to call  the  operation.  To  use
          this parameter, the caller must be an identity in the organization's
          management account or a delegated administrator account. The  speci-
          fied  account  ID must be a member account in the same organization.
          The organization must have all features enabled , and the  organiza-
          tion  must  have  trusted  access enabled for the Account Management
          service, and optionally a delegated admin account assigned.

          NOTE:
              The management account can't specify its own AccountId . It must
              call  the  operation  in standalone context by not including the
              AccountId parameter.

          To call this operation on an account that is not a member of an  or-
          ganization,  don't  specify this parameter. Instead, call the opera-
          tion using an identity belonging to the account whose  contacts  you
          wish to retrieve or modify.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.
