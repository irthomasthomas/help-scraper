OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          Specifies  the 12-digit account ID number of the Amazon Web Services
          account that you want to access or modify with  this  operation.  If
          you don't specify this parameter, it defaults to the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account of the identity used to call  the  operation.  To  use
          this parameter, the caller must be an identity in the organization's
          management account or a delegated administrator account. The  speci-
          fied  account ID must also be a member account in the same organiza-
          tion. The organization must have all features enabled , and the  or-
          ganization  must have trusted access enabled for the Account Manage-
          ment service, and optionally a delegated admin account assigned.

          NOTE:
              The management account can't specify its own AccountId . It must
              call  the  operation  in standalone context by not including the
              AccountId parameter.

          To call this operation on an account that is not a member of an  or-
          ganization,  don't  specify this parameter. Instead, call the opera-
          tion using an identity belonging to the account whose  contacts  you
          wish to retrieve or modify.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  total  number of items to return in the commands output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken  is provided in the commands output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the Amazon Web Services  CLI.  For  usage  examples,  see
          Pagination  in  the  Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User
          Guide .

       --next-token (string)
          A token used to specify where to start paginating. This is the Next-
          Token  from a previously truncated response. For usage examples, see
          Pagination in the Amazon Web Services Command  Line  Interface  User
          Guide .

       --region-opt-status-contains (list)
          A  list  of Region statuses (Enabling, Enabled, Disabling, Disabled,
          Enabled_by_default) to use to filter the list of Regions for a given
          account.  For  example, passing in a value of ENABLING will only re-
          turn a list of Regions with a Region status of ENABLING.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            ENABLED
            ENABLING
            DISABLING
            DISABLED
            ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there  is  more  data to be returned, this will be populated. It
          should be passed into the next-token request parameter  of  list-re-
          gions .

       Regions -> (list)
          This  is  a  list of Regions for a given account, or if the filtered
          parameter was used, a list of Regions that match the filter criteria
          set in the filter parameter.

          (structure)
              This  is  a  structure that expresses the Region for a given ac-
              count, consisting of a name and opt-in status.

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The Region code of a given Region (for example, us-east-1 ).

              RegionOptStatus -> (string)
                 One of potential statuses a Region can undergo (Enabled,  En-
                 abling, Disabled, Disabling, Enabled_By_Default).
