CREATE-SESSION()                                              CREATE-SESSION()



NAME
       create-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  session  that establishes temporary security credentials to
       support fast authentication and authorization for  the  Zonal  endpoint
       APIs  on  directory  buckets. For more information about Zonal endpoint
       APIs that include the Availability Zone in the request endpoint, see S3
       Express One Zone APIs in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       To make Zonal endpoint API requests on a directory bucket, use the Cre-
       ateSession API operation. Specifically, you grant  s3express:CreateSes-
       sion permission to a bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based
       policy. Then, you use IAM credentials to make the CreateSession API re-
       quest  on the bucket, which returns temporary security credentials that
       include the access key ID, secret access key, session token, and  expi-
       ration.  These  credentials  have  associated permissions to access the
       Zonal endpoint APIs. After the session is created, you dont need to use
       other policies to grant permissions to each Zonal endpoint API individ-
       ually. Instead, in your Zonal endpoint API requests, you sign your  re-
       quests by applying the temporary security credentials of the session to
       the request headers and following the SigV4  protocol  for  authentica-
       tion. You also apply the session token to the x-amz-s3session-token re-
       quest header for  authorization.  Temporary  security  credentials  are
       scoped  to  the bucket and expire after 5 minutes. After the expiration
       time, any calls that you make with those  credentials  will  fail.  You
       must use IAM credentials again to make a CreateSession API request that
       generates a new set of temporary credentials for use. Temporary creden-
       tials cannot be extended or refreshed beyond the original specified in-
       terval.

       If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle the session token  re-
       freshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session ex-
       pires. We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to initi-
       ate and manage requests to the CreateSession API. For more information,
       see Performance guidelines and design patterns in the  Amazon  S3  User
       Guide .

       NOTE:

          o You  must  make  requests for this API operation to the Zonal end-
            point. These endpoints support  virtual-hosted-style  requests  in
            the   format  https://*bucket_name*  .s3express-*az_id*  .*region*
            .amazonaws.com . Path-style requests are not supported.  For  more
            information,  see  Regional  and  Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3
            User Guide .

          o ``CopyObject`` API operation - Unlike other Zonal  endpoint  APIs,
            the  CopyObject  API  operation doesn't use the temporary security
            credentials returned from the CreateSession API operation for  au-
            thentication  and authorization. For information about authentica-
            tion and authorization of the CopyObject API operation  on  direc-
            tory buckets, see CopyObject .

          o ``HeadBucket``  API  operation - Unlike other Zonal endpoint APIs,
            the HeadBucket API operation doesn't use  the  temporary  security
            credentials  returned from the CreateSession API operation for au-
            thentication and authorization. For information about  authentica-
            tion  and  authorization of the HeadBucket API operation on direc-
            tory buckets, see HeadBucket .

          Permissions

       To obtain temporary security credentials, you must create a bucket pol-
       icy or an IAM identity-based policy that grants s3express:CreateSession
       permission to the bucket. In a policy, you can have the  s3express:Ses-
       sionMode  condition  key to control who can create a ReadWrite or Read-
       Only session. For more information about  ReadWrite  or  ReadOnly  ses-
       sions,            see            `            x-amz-create-session-mode
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html#API_CreateSession_RequestParameters`__
       .  For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One
       Zone and Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) iden-
       tity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide
       .

       To grant cross-account access to Zonal endpoint APIs, the bucket policy
       should also grant both accounts the s3express:CreateSession permission.
              HTTP Host header syntax

          Directory  buckets  -  The HTTP Host header syntax is `` Bucket_name
          .s3express-az_id .*region* .amazonaws.com`` .

OPTIONS
       --session-mode (string)
          Specifies the mode of the session that will be created, either Read-
          Write  or  ReadOnly  . By default, a ReadWrite session is created. A
          ReadWrite session is capable of executing  all  the  Zonal  endpoint
          APIs on a directory bucket. A ReadOnly session is constrained to ex-
          ecute the following Zonal endpoint APIs: GetObject  ,  HeadObject  ,
          ListObjectsV2  , GetObjectAttributes , ListParts , and ListMultipar-
          tUploads .

          Possible values:

          o ReadOnly

          o ReadWrite

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket that you create a session for.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Credentials -> (structure)
          The  established temporary security credentials for the created ses-
          sion..

          AccessKeyId -> (string)
              A unique identifier that's associated with a secret access  key.
              The access key ID and the secret access key are used together to
              sign programmatic Amazon  Web  Services  requests  cryptographi-
              cally.

          SecretAccessKey -> (string)
              A  key  that's  used with the access key ID to cryptographically
              sign programmatic Amazon Web Services requests.  Signing  a  re-
              quest  identifies the sender and prevents the request from being
              altered.

          SessionToken -> (string)
              A part of the temporary security credentials. The session  token
              is used to validate the temporary security credentials.

          Expiration -> (timestamp)
              Temporary  security  credentials expire after a specified inter-
              val. After temporary credentials expire, any calls that you make
              with those credentials will fail. So you must generate a new set
              of temporary credentials. Temporary credentials  cannot  be  ex-
              tended or refreshed beyond the original specified interval.
