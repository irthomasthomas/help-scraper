DELETE-BUCKET-WEBSITE()                                DELETE-BUCKET-WEBSITE()



NAME
       delete-bucket-website -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       This  action  removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3
       returns a 200 OK response upon successfully deleting a website configu-
       ration  on  the specified bucket. You will get a 200 OK response if the
       website configuration you are trying to delete does not  exist  on  the
       bucket. Amazon S3 returns a 404 response if the bucket specified in the
       request does not exist.

       This DELETE action requires the S3:DeleteBucketWebsite  permission.  By
       default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration at-
       tached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other  users  per-
       mission  to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy
       granting them the S3:DeleteBucketWebsite permission.

       For more information about hosting websites, see  Hosting  Websites  on
       Amazon S3 .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  bucket name for which you want to remove the website configura-
          tion.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed

          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
