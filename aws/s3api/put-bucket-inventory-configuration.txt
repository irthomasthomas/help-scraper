PUT-BUCKET-INVENTORY-CONFIGURATION()      PUT-BUCKET-INVENTORY-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-inventory-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       This  implementation  of the PUT action adds an inventory configuration
       (identified by the inventory ID) to the bucket.  You  can  have  up  to
       1,000 inventory configurations per bucket.

       Amazon  S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket
       on a daily or weekly basis, and the results are  published  to  a  flat
       file.  The  bucket that is inventoried is called the source bucket, and
       the bucket where the inventory flat file is stored is called the desti-
       nation  bucket.  The  destination bucket must be in the same Amazon Web
       Services Region as the source bucket.

       When you configure an inventory for a source bucket,  you  specify  the
       destination  bucket  where  you  want  the  inventory to be stored, and
       whether to generate the inventory daily or weekly. You can also config-
       ure what object metadata to include and whether to inventory all object
       versions or only current versions. For more information, see Amazon  S3
       Inventory in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

       WARNING:
          You  must  create a bucket policy on the destination bucket to grant
          permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket in  the  de-
          fined  location. For an example policy, see Granting Permissions for
          Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis .

          Permissions

       To use  this  operation,  you  must  have  permission  to  perform  the
       s3:PutInventoryConfiguration  action. The bucket owner has this permis-
       sion by default and can grant this permission to others.

       The s3:PutInventoryConfiguration permission allows a user to create  an
       S3  Inventory report that includes all object metadata fields available
       and to specify the destination bucket to store the  inventory.  A  user
       with  read  access to objects in the destination bucket can also access
       all object metadata fields that are available in the inventory report.

       To restrict access to an inventory report, see Restricting access to an
       Amazon  S3  Inventory report in the Amazon S3 User Guide . For more in-
       formation about the metadata fields  available  in  S3  Inventory,  see
       Amazon S3 Inventory lists in the Amazon S3 User Guide . For more infor-
       mation about permissions, see Permissions related to bucket subresource
       operations  and Identity and access management in Amazon S3 in the Ama-
       zon S3 User Guide .
          PutBucketInventoryConfiguration has the following special errors:
              HTTP 400 Bad Request Error

          Code: InvalidArgument

          Cause: Invalid Argument
              HTTP 400 Bad Request Error

              HTTP 403 Forbidden Error

          Cause:  You are not the owner of the specified bucket, or you do not

            }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To set an inventory configuration for a bucket

       The following put-bucket-inventory-configuration example sets a  weekly
       ORC-formatted inventory report for the bucket my-bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-inventory-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --id 1 \
              --inventory-configuration '{"Destination": { "S3BucketDestination": { "AccountId": "123456789012", "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket", "Format": "ORC" }}, "IsEnabled": true, "Id": "1", "IncludedObjectVersions": "Current", "Schedule": { "Frequency": "Weekly" }}'

       This command produces no output.

       Example 2: To set an inventory configuration for a bucket

       The  following  put-bucket-inventory-configuration example sets a daily
       CSV-formatted inventory report for the bucket my-bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-inventory-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --id 2 \
              --inventory-configuration '{"Destination": { "S3BucketDestination": { "AccountId": "123456789012", "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket", "Format": "CSV" }}, "IsEnabled": true, "Id": "2", "IncludedObjectVersions": "Current", "Schedule": { "Frequency": "Daily" }}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
