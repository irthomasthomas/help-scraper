DELETE-OBJECT()                                                DELETE-OBJECT()



NAME
       delete-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the  null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a
       delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there
       isn't  a  null  version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but will
       still respond that the command was successful.

       To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must
       use  the  version  Id  subresource.  Using this subresource permanently
       deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete  marker,  Amazon
       S3 sets the response header, x-amz-delete-marker , to true.

       If  the  object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket ver-
       sioning configuration is MFA  Delete  enabled,  you  must  include  the
       x-amz-mfa request header in the DELETE versionId request. Requests that
       include x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS.

       For more information about MFA Delete, see Using MFA Delete  .  To  see
       sample requests that use versioning, see Sample Request .

       You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or configure
       its lifecycle (PutBucketLifecycle ) to enable Amazon S3 to remove  them
       for you. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or delet-
       ing objects from your bucket, you must deny them the s3:DeleteObject  ,
       s3:DeleteObjectVersion , and s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration actions.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name of the bucket containing the object.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form `` AccessPointName -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about  S3  on  Outposts ARNs, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in the
          Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --key (string)
          Key name of the object to delete.

       --mfa (string)
          The concatenation of the authentication device's  serial  number,  a
          space,  and  the  value that is displayed on your authentication de-
          vice. Required to permanently delete a versioned object if  version-
          ing is configured with MFA delete enabled.

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their  re-
          quests.  For  information  about  downloading objects from Requester
          Pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requester Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --bypass-governance-retention | --no-bypass-governance-retention (bool-
       ean)
          Indicates whether S3 Object Lock should bypass  Governance-mode  re-
          strictions  to  process this operation. To use this header, you must
          have the s3:BypassGovernanceRetention permission.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command deletes an object named test.txt  from  a  bucket
       named my-bucket:

          aws s3api delete-object --bucket my-bucket --key test.txt

       If bucket versioning is enabled, the output will contain the version ID
       of the delete marker:

          {
            "VersionId": "9_gKg5vG56F.TTEUdwkxGpJ3tNDlWlGq",
            "DeleteMarker": true
          }

       the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       DeleteMarker -> (boolean)
