DELETE-OBJECT()                                                DELETE-OBJECT()



NAME
       delete-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  an  object from a bucket. The behavior depends on the bucket's
       versioning state:

       o If versioning is enabled, the operation removes the null version  (if
         there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes
         the latest version of the object. If there isn't a null version, Ama-
         zon  S3  does  not remove any objects but will still respond that the
         command was successful.

       o If versioning is suspended or not enabled, the operation  permanently
         deletes the object.

       NOTE:

          o Directory  buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for
            directory buckets. For this API operation, only the null value  of
            the  version  ID  is  supported by directory buckets. You can only
            specify null to the versionId query parameter in the request.

          o Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make  requests
            for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints sup-
            port virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
            ``
            https://bucket_name    .s3express-az_id     .*region*     .amazon-
            aws.com/key-name  ``  . Path-style requests are not supported. For
            more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in  the  Amazon
            S3 User Guide .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 37)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       To  remove a specific version, you must use the versionId query parame-
       ter. Using this query parameter permanently deletes the version. If the
       object  deleted  is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header
       x-amz-delete-marker to true.

       If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the  bucket  ver-
       sioning  configuration  is  MFA  Delete  enabled,  you must include the
       x-amz-mfa request header in the DELETE versionId request. Requests that
       include  x-amz-mfa  must  use  HTTPS.  For  more  information about MFA
       Delete, see Using MFA Delete in the Amazon S3 User Guide . To see  sam-
       ple requests that use versioning, see Sample Request .

       NOTE:
          Directory  buckets  - MFA delete is not supported by directory buck-
          ets.

       You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object  or  calling
       (PutBucketLifecycle  )  to  enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If
       you want to block users or accounts from removing or  deleting  objects
       from your bucket, you must deny them the s3:DeleteObject , s3:DeleteOb-
       jectVersion , and s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration actions.

       NOTE:
              Directory buckets - S3 Lifecycle is not supported  by  directory
              buckets.

          Permissions

       o General  purpose  bucket  permissions - The following permissions are
         required in your policies when your  DeleteObjects  request  includes
         specific headers.

         o

           **
           s3:DeleteObject  **  -  To delete an object from a bucket, you must
           always have the s3:DeleteObject permission.

         System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 80)
           Inline strong start-string without end-string.

         o

           **
           s3:DeleteObjectVersion ** - To delete a specific version of an  ob-
           ject from a versiong-enabled bucket, you must have the s3:DeleteOb-
           jectVersion permission.

         System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 82)
           Inline strong start-string without end-string.

       o Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API  operation
         on  a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the ` CreateSession
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html`__
         API  operation  for  session-based  authorization.  Specifically, you
         grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory  bucket
         in  a  bucket  policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make
         the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a  session  token.
         With  the  session token in your request header, you can make API re-
         quests to this operation. After the session token expires,  you  make
         another  CreateSession  API  call to generate a new session token for
         use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and  refresh  the
         session  token  automatically  to  avoid service interruptions when a
         session expires. For more information about authorization, see ` Cre-
         ateSession
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html`__
         .

         HTTP Host header syntax
          Directory  buckets  -  The HTTP Host header syntax is `` Bucket_name
          .s3express-az_id .*region* .amazonaws.com`` .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name of the bucket containing the object.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
              `` Bucket_name  .s3express-az_id  .*region*  .amazonaws.com``  .
              Path-style  requests  are  not supported. Directory bucket names
              must be unique in the chosen  Availability  Zone.  Bucket  names
              must follow the format `` bucket_base_name --az-id --x-s3`` (for
              example, `` DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --usw2-az2 --x-s3`` ). For infor-
              mation  about  bucket  naming restrictions, see Directory bucket
              naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Access points - When you use this action with an  access  point,
              you  must  provide the alias of the access point in place of the
              bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the  ac-
              cess  point  ARN,  you  must direct requests to the access point
              hostname. The access point hostname takes the form  AccessPoint-
              Name  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com. When
              using this action with an access point through  the  Amazon  Web
              Services  SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the
              bucket name. For more information about access point  ARNs,  see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
                 Access  points  and  Object Lambda access points are not sup-
                 ported by directory buckets.

              S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts,  you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname.
              The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the  form  ``  AccessPointName
              -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` .
              When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the  Amazon
              Web  Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in
              place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on  Out-
              posts  ARNs,  see  What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User
              Guide .

       --key (string)
          Key name of the object to delete.

       --mfa (string)
          The concatenation of the authentication device's  serial  number,  a
          space,  and  the  value that is displayed on your authentication de-
          vice. Required to permanently delete a versioned object if  version-
          ing is configured with MFA delete enabled.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --version-id (string)
          Version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.

          NOTE:
              For directory buckets in this API operation, only the null value
              of the version ID is supported.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has  Requester
          Pays  enabled,  the  requester will pay for corresponding charges to
          copy the object. For information about downloading objects from  Re-
          quester  Pays  buckets,  see  Downloading  Objects in Requester Pays
          Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --bypass-governance-retention | --no-bypass-governance-retention (bool-
       ean)
          Indicates  whether  S3 Object Lock should bypass Governance-mode re-
          strictions to process this operation. To use this header,  you  must
          have the s3:BypassGovernanceRetention permission.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The  following  command  deletes an object named test.txt from a bucket
       named my-bucket:

          aws s3api delete-object --bucket my-bucket --key test.txt

       If bucket versioning is enabled, the output will contain the version ID
       of the delete marker:

          {
            "VersionId": "9_gKg5vG56F.TTEUdwkxGpJ3tNDlWlGq",
            "DeleteMarker": true
          }

       For  more  information  about deleting objects, see Deleting Objects in
       the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       DeleteMarker -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the specified object version that was  permanently
          deleted  was  (true) or was not (false) a delete marker before dele-
          tion. In a simple DELETE, this header indicates  whether  (true)  or
          not (false) the current version of the object is a delete marker.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       VersionId -> (string)
          Returns  the  version ID of the delete marker created as a result of
          the DELETE operation.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
