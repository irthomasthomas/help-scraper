NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  torrent files from a bucket. BitTorrent can save you bandwidth
       when you're distributing large files.

       NOTE:
          You can get torrent only for objects that are  less  than  5  GB  in
          size, and that are not encrypted using server-side encryption with a
          customer-provided encryption key.

       To use GET, you must have READ access to the object.

       This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
