DELETE-BUCKET()                                                DELETE-BUCKET()



NAME
       delete-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  S3 bucket. All objects (including all object versions and
       delete markers) in the bucket must be deleted before the bucket  itself
       can be deleted.

       NOTE:

          o Directory buckets - If multipart uploads in a directory bucket are
            in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress
            multipart uploads are aborted or completed.

          o Directory  buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests
            for this API operation to the Regional endpoint.  These  endpoints
            support path-style requests in the format
            ``
            https://s3express-control.*region_code* .amazonaws.com/bucket-name
            `` . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. For more  in-
            formation,  see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User
            Guide .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 29)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          Permissions

       o General purpose bucket permissions - You  must  have  the  s3:Delete-
         Bucket permission on the specified bucket in a policy.

       o Directory  bucket  permissions  - You must have the s3express:Delete-
         Bucket permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket
         policy.  Cross-account  access to this API operation isn't supported.
         This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web  Services  ac-
         count  that  owns  the resource. For more information about directory
         bucket policies and permissions, see Amazon Web Services Identity and
         Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User
         Guide .

         HTTP Host header syntax
          Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header  syntax  is  s3express-con-
          trol.*region* .amazonaws.com .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          Specifies the bucket being deleted.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket,  you  must  use  path-style  requests  in   the   format
              https://s3express-control.*region_code*                 .amazon-
              aws.com/*bucket-name* `` . Virtual-hosted-style requests  aren't
              supported.  Directory  bucket names must be unique in the chosen
              Availability Zone. Bucket names must also follow the  format  ``
              *bucket_base_name*  --*az_id*  --x-s3 (for example, `` DOC-EXAM-
              PLE-BUCKET --usw2-az1 --x-s3`` ). For information  about  bucket
              naming  restrictions,  see  Directory bucket naming rules in the
              Amazon S3 User Guide

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

          NOTE:
              For directory buckets, this header is not supported in this  API
              operation.  If  you  specify this header, the request fails with
              the HTTP status code 501 Not Implemented .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command deletes a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket my-bucket --region us-east-1

OUTPUT
       None
