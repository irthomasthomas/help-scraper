HEAD-BUCKET()                                                    HEAD-BUCKET()



NAME
       head-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       This action is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have per-
       mission to access it. The action returns a 200 OK if the bucket  exists
       and you have permission to access it.

       If  the  bucket  does not exist or you do not have permission to access
       it, the HEAD request returns a generic 400 Bad Request , 403  Forbidden
       or  404  Not  Found code. A message body is not included, so you cannot
       determine the exception beyond these error codes.

       To use this  operation,  you  must  have  permissions  to  perform  the
       s3:ListBucket  action.  The bucket owner has this permission by default
       and can grant this permission to others.  For  more  information  about
       permissions,  see  Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations
       and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources .

       To use this API operation against an access point, you must provide the
       alias  of  the  access point in place of the bucket name or specify the
       access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct  re-
       quests  to  the  access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
       the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazon-
       aws.com.  When  using the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the ARN
       in place of the bucket name. For more  information,  see  Using  access
       points .

       To  use  this API operation against an Object Lambda access point, pro-
       vide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket
       name.  If  the  Object  Lambda  access  point alias in a request is not
       valid, the error code  InvalidAccessPointAliasError  is  returned.  For
       more information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError , see List of Error
       Codes .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.

          When using this action with an access point,  you  must  direct  re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .ama-
          zonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in  place
          of  the  bucket  name. For more information about access point ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When you use this action with an Object Lambda access point, provide
          the  alias  of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket
          name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a  request  is  not
          valid,  the error code InvalidAccessPointAliasError is returned. For
          more information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError ,  see  List  of
          Error Codes .

          When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form `` AccessPointName -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` . When you use this action  with  S3
          on  Outposts  through  the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the
          Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more  in-
          formation  about  S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command verifies access to a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api head-bucket --bucket my-bucket

       If the bucket exists and you have access to it, no output is  returned.
       Otherwise, an error message will be shown. For example:

          A client error (404) occurred when calling the HeadBucket operation: Not Found

OUTPUT
       None
