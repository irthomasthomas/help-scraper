HEAD-BUCKET()                                                    HEAD-BUCKET()



NAME
       head-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       You  can  use this operation to determine if a bucket exists and if you
       have permission to access it. The action returns a 200 OK if the bucket
       exists and you have permission to access it.

       NOTE:
              If  the  bucket  does not exist or you do not have permission to
              access it, the HEAD request returns a generic 400 Bad Request  ,
              403  Forbidden  or 404 Not Found code. A message body is not in-
              cluded, so you cannot determine the exception beyond these  HTTP
              response codes.

              Authentication and authorization

          General  purpose  buckets - Request to public buckets that grant the
          s3:ListBucket permission publicly do not  need  to  be  signed.  All
          other  HeadBucket requests must be authenticated and signed by using
          IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access  key  for  the  IAM
          identities).   All   headers   with  the  x-amz-  prefix,  including
          x-amz-copy-source , must be signed. For more information,  see  REST
          Authentication .

          Directory buckets - You must use IAM credentials to authenticate and
          authorize your access to the HeadBucket API  operation,  instead  of
          using  the  temporary security credentials through the CreateSession
          API operation.

       Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication  and  authoriza-
       tion on your behalf.
          Permissions

       o General  purpose bucket permissions - To use this operation, you must
         have permissions to perform  the  s3:ListBucket  action.  The  bucket
         owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to
         others. For more information about permissions, see  Managing  access
         permissions to your Amazon S3 resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       o Directory bucket permissions - You must have the ** s3express:Create-
         Session ** permission in the Action element of a policy. By  default,
         the session is in the ReadWrite mode. If you want to restrict the ac-
         cess, you can explicitly set the s3express:SessionMode condition  key
         to  ReadOnly on the bucket. For more information about example bucket
         policies, see Example bucket policies for S3  Express  One  Zone  and
         Amazon  Web  Services  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM) iden-
         tity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone in  the  Amazon  S3  User
         Guide .

         HTTP Host header syntax
          Directory  buckets  -  The HTTP Host header syntax is `` Bucket_name
          .s3express-az_id .*region* .amazonaws.com`` .

       NOTE:
          You must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint.
          These  endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
          https://*bucket_name* .s3express-*az_id* .*region* .amazonaws.com  .
          Path-style  requests  are  not  supported. For more information, see
          Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
              `` Bucket_name  .s3express-az_id  .*region*  .amazonaws.com``  .
              Path-style  requests  are  not supported. Directory bucket names
              must be unique in the chosen  Availability  Zone.  Bucket  names
              must follow the format `` bucket_base_name --az-id --x-s3`` (for
              example, `` DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --usw2-az1 --x-s3`` ). For infor-
              mation  about  bucket  naming restrictions, see Directory bucket
              naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Access points - When you use this action with an  access  point,
              you  must  provide the alias of the access point in place of the
              bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the  ac-
              cess  point  ARN,  you  must direct requests to the access point
              hostname. The access point hostname takes the form  AccessPoint-
              Name  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com. When
              using this action with an access point through  the  Amazon  Web
              Services  SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the
              bucket name. For more information about access point  ARNs,  see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Object  Lambda  access  points - When you use this API operation
              with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Ob-
              ject Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Ob-
              ject Lambda access point alias in a request is  not  valid,  the
              error  code  InvalidAccessPointAliasError  is returned. For more
              information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError , see List of Er-
              ror Codes .

          NOTE:
                 Access  points  and  Object Lambda access points are not sup-
                 ported by directory buckets.

              S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts,  you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname.
              The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the  form  ``  AccessPointName
              -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` .
              When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the  Amazon
              Web  Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in
              place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on  Out-
              posts  ARNs,  see  What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User
              Guide .

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command verifies access to a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api head-bucket --bucket my-bucket

       If the bucket exists and you have access to it, no output is  returned.
       Otherwise, an error message will be shown. For example:

          A client error (404) occurred when calling the HeadBucket operation: Not Found

OUTPUT
       BucketLocationType -> (string)
          The type of location where the bucket is created.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is only supported by directory buckets.

       BucketLocationName -> (string)
          The name of the location where the bucket will be created.

          For  directory buckets, the AZ ID of the Availability Zone where the
          bucket is created. An example AZ ID value is usw2-az1 .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is only supported by directory buckets.

       BucketRegion -> (string)
          The Region that the bucket is located.

       AccessPointAlias -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the bucket name used in the request is  an  access
          point alias.

          NOTE:
              For directory buckets, the value of this field is false .
