GET-BUCKET-LIFECYCLE-CONFIGURATION()      GET-BUCKET-LIFECYCLE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket. For
       information about lifecycle configuration, see Object Lifecycle Manage-
       ment .

       Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule
       using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, object  size,
       or  any  combination  of these. Accordingly, this section describes the
       latest API, which is compatible with the new functionality. The  previ-
       ous  version of the API supported filtering based only on an object key
       name prefix, which is supported for general purpose buckets  for  back-
       ward    compatibility.   For   the   related   API   description,   see
       GetBucketLifecycle .

       NOTE:
          Lifecyle configurations for directory buckets only support  expiring
          objects  and cancelling multipart uploads. Expiring of versioned ob-
          jects, transitions and tag filters are not supported.

          Permissions

       o General purpose bucket permissions - By default, all  Amazon  S3  re-
         sources  are  private, including buckets, objects, and related subre-
         sources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website  configura-
         tion).  Only the resource owner (that is, the Amazon Web Services ac-
         count that created it) can access the resource.  The  resource  owner
         can  optionally  grant access permissions to others by writing an ac-
         cess policy. For this operation, a user must have  the  s3:GetLifecy-
         cleConfiguration  permission. For more information about permissions,
         see Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources .

       o Directory bucket permissions - You must have the s3express:GetLifecy-
         cleConfiguration  permission  in  an IAM identity-based policy to use
         this operation. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't sup-
         ported. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to
         others by creating a role or user for them as long as they are within
         the  same  account  as  the  owner and resource. For more information
         about directory bucket policies and permissions, see Authorizing  Re-
         gional endpoint APIs with IAM in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
                 Directory  buckets - For directory buckets, you must make re-
                 quests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These
                 endpoints support path-style requests in the format
                 ``
                 https://s3express-control.*region_code*              .amazon-
                 aws.com/bucket-name `` . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't
                 supported.  For more information, see Regional and Zonal end-
                 points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to get the lifecycle information.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

          NOTE:
              This parameter applies to general purpose buckets  only.  It  is
              not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command  retrieves  the  lifecycle  configuration  for  a
       bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

OUTPUT
       Rules -> (list)
          Container for a lifecycle rule.

          (structure)
              A lifecycle rule for individual objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              For more information see, Managing your storage lifecycle in the
              Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Expiration -> (structure)
                 Specifies the expiration for the lifecycle of the  object  in
                 the  form  of date, days and, whether the object has a delete
                 marker.

                 Date -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates at what date the  object  is  to  be  moved  or
                     deleted. The date value must conform to the ISO 8601 for-
                     mat. The time is always midnight UTC.

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter  applies  to  general  purpose  buckets
                        only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecy-
                        cle configurations.

                 Days -> (integer)
                     Indicates the lifetime, in days, of the objects that  are
                     subject  to  the rule. The value must be a non-zero posi-
                     tive integer.

                 ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether Amazon S3 will remove a  delete  marker
                     with  no  noncurrent versions. If set to true, the delete
                     marker will be expired; if set to false the policy  takes
                     no  action. This cannot be specified with Days or Date in
                     a Lifecycle Expiration Policy.

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter  applies  to  general  purpose  buckets
                        only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecy-
                        cle configurations.

              ID -> (string)
                 Unique identifier for the rule. The value  cannot  be  longer
                 than 255 characters.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Prefix  identifying one or more objects to which the rule ap-
                 plies. This is no longer used; use Filter instead.

                 WARNING:
                     Replacement must be made for object keys containing  spe-
                     cial characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML
                     requests. For more information, see  XML  related  object
                     key constraints .

              Filter -> (structure)
                 The  Filter is used to identify objects that a Lifecycle Rule
                 applies to. A Filter must have exactly one of Prefix , Tag  ,
                 or  And  specified.  Filter  is required if the LifecycleRule
                 does not contain a Prefix element.

                 NOTE:
                     Tag filters are not supported for directory buckets.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     Prefix identifying one or more objects to which the  rule
                     applies.

                     WARNING:
                        Replacement  must  be  made for object keys containing
                        special characters (such as carriage returns) when us-
                        ing  XML  requests.  For more information, see XML re-
                        lated object key constraints .

                 Tag -> (structure)
                     This tag must exist in the object's tag set in order  for
                     the rule to apply.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter  applies  to  general  purpose buckets
                        only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecy-
                        cle configurations.

                     Key -> (string)

                     Value -> (string)
                        Value of the tag.

                 ObjectSizeGreaterThan -> (long)
                     Minimum object size to which the rule applies.

                 ObjectSizeLessThan -> (long)
                     Maximum object size to which the rule applies.

                 And -> (structure)
                     This  is used in a Lifecycle Rule Filter to apply a logi-
                     cal AND to two or more  predicates.  The  Lifecycle  Rule
                     will  apply  to any object matching all of the predicates
                     configured inside the And operator.

                     Prefix -> (string)
                        Prefix identifying one or more objects  to  which  the
                        rule applies.

                     Tags -> (list)
                        All  of  these tags must exist in the object's tag set
                        in order for the rule to apply.

                        (structure)
                            A container of a key value name pair.

                            Key -> (string)
                               Name of the object key.

                            Value -> (string)
                               Value of the tag.

                     ObjectSizeGreaterThan -> (long)
                        Minimum object size to which the rule applies.

                     ObjectSizeLessThan -> (long)
                        Maximum object size to which the rule applies.

              Status -> (string)
                 If 'Enabled', the rule is currently being applied.  If  'Dis-
                 abled', the rule is not currently being applied.

              Transitions -> (list)
                 Specifies when an Amazon S3 object transitions to a specified
                 storage class.

                 NOTE:
                     This parameter applies to general purpose  buckets  only.
                     It  is  not supported for directory bucket lifecycle con-
                     figurations.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies when an object transitions to a specified stor-
                     age class. For more information about Amazon S3 lifecycle
                     configuration rules, see Transitioning Objects Using Ama-
                     zon S3 Lifecycle in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     Date -> (timestamp)
                        Indicates  when objects are transitioned to the speci-
                        fied storage class. The date value must be in ISO 8601
                        format. The time is always midnight UTC.

                     Days -> (integer)
                        Indicates  the  number of days after creation when ob-
                        jects are transitioned to the specified storage class.
                        The value must be a positive integer.

                     StorageClass -> (string)
                        The  storage  class  to  which  you want the object to
                        transition.

              NoncurrentVersionTransitions -> (list)
                 Specifies the transition rule for the lifecycle rule that de-
                 scribes  when  noncurrent  objects  transition  to a specific
                 storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or  ver-
                 sioning  is  suspended),  you  can set this action to request
                 that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent  object  versions  to  a
                 specific  storage class at a set period in the object's life-
                 time.

                 NOTE:
                     This parameter applies to general purpose  buckets  only.
                     It  is  not supported for directory bucket lifecycle con-
                     figurations.

                 (structure)
                     Container for the transition  rule  that  describes  when
                     noncurrent  objects  transition to the STANDARD_IA , ONE-
                     ZONE_IA , INTELLIGENT_TIERING , GLACIER_IR , GLACIER , or
                     DEEP_ARCHIVE  storage  class.  If your bucket is version-
                     ing-enabled (or versioning is  suspended),  you  can  set
                     this  action to request that Amazon S3 transition noncur-
                     rent object versions to the STANDARD_IA  ,  ONEZONE_IA  ,
                     INTELLIGENT_TIERING  , GLACIER_IR , GLACIER , or DEEP_AR-
                     CHIVE storage class at a specific period in the  object's
                     lifetime.

                     NoncurrentDays -> (integer)
                        Specifies  the  number of days an object is noncurrent
                        before Amazon S3 can perform  the  associated  action.
                        For  information  about  the  noncurrent days calcula-
                        tions, see How Amazon S3 Calculates How Long an Object
                        Has Been Noncurrent in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     StorageClass -> (string)
                        The class of storage used to store the object.

                     NewerNoncurrentVersions -> (integer)
                        Specifies  how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will
                        retain in the same storage class before  transitioning
                        objects. You can specify up to 100 noncurrent versions
                        to retain. Amazon S3 will  transition  any  additional
                        noncurrent versions beyond the specified number to re-
                        tain. For more information about noncurrent  versions,
                        see  Lifecycle configuration elements in the Amazon S3
                        User Guide .

              NoncurrentVersionExpiration -> (structure)
                 Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon  expi-
                 ration,  Amazon  S3 permanently deletes the noncurrent object
                 versions. You set this lifecycle configuration  action  on  a
                 bucket  that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to request
                 that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions  at  a  spe-
                 cific period in the object's lifetime.

                 NOTE:
                     This  parameter  applies to general purpose buckets only.
                     It is not supported for directory bucket  lifecycle  con-
                     figurations.

                 NoncurrentDays -> (integer)
                     Specifies  the number of days an object is noncurrent be-
                     fore Amazon S3 can perform  the  associated  action.  The
                     value  must  be a non-zero positive integer. For informa-
                     tion about the noncurrent days calculations, see How Ama-
                     zon S3 Calculates When an Object Became Noncurrent in the
                     Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter  applies  to  general  purpose  buckets
                        only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecy-
                        cle configurations.

                 NewerNoncurrentVersions -> (integer)
                     Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will re-
                     tain.  You  can  specify up to 100 noncurrent versions to
                     retain. Amazon S3 will permanently delete any  additional
                     noncurrent  versions  beyond  the specified number to re-
                     tain. For more information about noncurrent versions, see
                     Lifecycle  configuration  elements  in the Amazon S3 User
                     Guide .

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter  applies  to  general  purpose  buckets
                        only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecy-
                        cle configurations.

              AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload -> (structure)
                 Specifies the days since the initiation of an incomplete mul-
                 tipart upload that Amazon S3 will wait before permanently re-
                 moving all parts of the upload.  For  more  information,  see
                 Aborting  Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecy-
                 cle Configuration in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 DaysAfterInitiation -> (integer)
                     Specifies the number of days after which Amazon S3 aborts
                     an incomplete multipart upload.

       TransitionDefaultMinimumObjectSize -> (string)
          Indicates  which  default minimum object size behavior is applied to
          the lifecycle configuration.

          NOTE:
              This parameter applies to general purpose buckets  only.  It  is
              not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

          o all_storage_classes_128K  -  Objects  smaller than 128 KB will not
            transition to any storage class by default.

          o varies_by_storage_class - Objects smaller than 128 KB will transi-
            tion to Glacier Flexible Retrieval or Glacier Deep Archive storage
            classes. By default, all other storage classes will prevent  tran-
            sitions smaller than 128 KB.

          To  customize the minimum object size for any transition you can add
          a filter that specifies a custom  ObjectSizeGreaterThan  or  Object-
          SizeLessThan in the body of your transition rule. Custom filters al-
          ways take precedence over the default transition behavior.
