NAME
       list-bucket-metrics-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Lists the metrics configurations for the bucket. The metrics configura-
       tions are only for the request metrics of the bucket and do not provide
       information on daily storage metrics. You can have up to 1,000 configu-
       rations per bucket.

       This action supports list pagination and does not return more than  100
       configurations  at  a time. Always check the IsTruncated element in the
       response. If there are no more configurations to list,  IsTruncated  is
       set  to false. If there are more configurations to list, IsTruncated is
       set to true, and there is a value in NextContinuationToken  .  You  use
       the  NextContinuationToken value to continue the pagination of the list
       by passing the value in continuation-token in the request  to  GET  the
       next page.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Get-
       MetricsConfiguration action. The bucket owner has  this  permission  by
       default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Re-
       sources .

       For more information about metrics configurations  and  CloudWatch  re-
       quest metrics, see Monitoring Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket containing the metrics configurations to  re-
          trieve.

       --continuation-token (string)
          The  marker that is used to continue a metrics configuration listing
          that has been truncated. Use the NextContinuationToken from a previ-
          ously truncated list response to continue the listing. The continua-
          tion token is an opaque value that Amazon S3 understands.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of metrics configurations for a bucket

       The following list-bucket-metrics-configurations  example  retrieves  a
       list of metrics configurations for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api list-bucket-metrics-configurations \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "IsTruncated": false,
              "MetricsConfigurationList": [
                  {
                      "Filter": {
                          "Prefix": "logs"
                      },
                      "Id": "123"
                  },
                  {
                      "Filter": {
                          "Prefix": "tmp"
                      },
                      "Id": "234"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the  returned  list of metrics configurations is
          complete. A value of true indicates that the list  is  not  complete
          and  the NextContinuationToken will be provided for a subsequent re-
          quest.

       ContinuationToken -> (string)
          The marker that is used as a starting point for this metrics config-
          uration  list  response. This value is present if it was sent in the
          request.

       NextContinuationToken -> (string)
          The marker used to continue a metrics configuration listing that has
          been  truncated.  Use  the  NextContinuationToken  from a previously
          truncated list response to continue the  listing.  The  continuation
          token is an opaque value that Amazon S3 understands.

       MetricsConfigurationList -> (list)
          The list of metrics configurations for a bucket.

          (structure)
              Specifies  a  metrics  configuration  for the CloudWatch request
              metrics (specified by the metrics configuration ID) from an Ama-
              zon S3 bucket. If you're updating an existing metrics configura-
              tion, note that this is a full replacement of the existing  met-
              rics  configuration.  If you don't include the elements you want
              to  keep,  they  are   erased.   For   more   information,   see
              PutBucketMetricsConfiguration .

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID used to identify the metrics configuration. The ID has
                 a 64 character limit and can only contain  letters,  numbers,
                 periods, dashes, and underscores.

              Filter -> (structure)
                 Specifies a metrics configuration filter. The metrics config-
                 uration will only include objects that meet the filter's cri-
                 teria.  A  filter  must be a prefix, an object tag, an access
                 point ARN, or a conjunction (MetricsAndOperator).

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix used when evaluating a metrics filter.

                 Tag -> (structure)
                     The tag used when evaluating a metrics filter.

                     Key -> (string)
                        Name of the object key.

                     Value -> (string)
                        Value of the tag.

                 AccessPointArn -> (string)
                     The access point ARN used when evaluating a metrics  fil-
                     ter.

                 And -> (structure)
                     A  conjunction (logical AND) of predicates, which is used
                     in evaluating a metrics filter. The operator must have at
                     least two predicates, and an object must match all of the
                     predicates in order for the filter to apply.

                     Prefix -> (string)
                        The prefix used when evaluating an AND predicate.

                     Tags -> (list)
                        The list of tags used when evaluating  an  AND  predi-
                        cate.

                        (structure)
                            A container of a key value name pair.

                            Key -> (string)
                               Name of the object key.

                            Value -> (string)
                               Value of the tag.

                     AccessPointArn -> (string)
                        The access point ARN used when evaluating an AND pred-
                        icate.
