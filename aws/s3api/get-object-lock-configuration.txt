SYNOPSIS
            get-object-lock-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket whose Object Lock configuration you want to retrieve.

          When using this action with an access point,  you  must  direct  re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .ama-
          zonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in  place
          of  the  bucket  name. For more information about access point ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve an object lock configuration for a bucket

       The  following  get-object-lock-configuration example retrieves the ob-
       ject lock configuration for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api get-object-lock-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket-with-object-lock

       Output:

          {
              "ObjectLockConfiguration": {
                  "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled",
                  "Rule": {
                      "DefaultRetention": {
                          "Mode": "COMPLIANCE",
                          "Days": 50
                      }
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ObjectLockConfiguration -> (structure)
          The specified bucket's Object Lock configuration.

          ObjectLockEnabled -> (string)
              Indicates whether this bucket has an Object  Lock  configuration
              enabled.  Enable ObjectLockEnabled when you apply ObjectLockCon-
              figuration to a bucket.

          Rule -> (structure)
              Specifies the Object Lock rule for the specified object.  Enable
              the  this  rule  when  you  apply  ObjectLockConfiguration  to a
              bucket. Bucket settings require both a mode and  a  period.  The
              period  can be either Days or Years but you must select one. You

              DefaultRetention -> (structure)
