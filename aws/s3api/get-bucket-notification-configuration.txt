NAME
       get-bucket-notification-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the notification configuration of a bucket.

       If  notifications  are not enabled on the bucket, the action returns an
       empty NotificationConfiguration element.

       By default, you must be the bucket owner to read the notification  con-
       figuration of a bucket. However, the bucket owner can use a bucket pol-
       icy to grant permission to other users to read this configuration  with
       the s3:GetBucketNotification permission.

       To use this API operation against an access point, provide the alias of
       the access point in place of the bucket name.

       To use this API operation against an Object Lambda access  point,  pro-
       vide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket
       name. If the Object Lambda access point  alias  in  a  request  is  not
       valid,  the  error  code  InvalidAccessPointAliasError is returned. For
       more information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError , see List of Error
       Codes .

       For more information about setting and reading the notification config-
       uration on a bucket, see Setting Up Notification of Bucket Events . For
       more information about bucket policies, see Using Bucket Policies .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name of the bucket for which to get the notification configura-
          tion.

          To use this API operation against an access point, provide the alias
          of the access point in place of the bucket name.

          To  use  this  API  operation against an Object Lambda access point,
          provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of  the
          bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is
          not valid, the error code InvalidAccessPointAliasError is  returned.
          For  more  information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError , see List
          of Error Codes .

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
