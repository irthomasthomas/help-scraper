GET-BUCKET-INTELLIGENT-TIERING-CGET-BUCKET-INTELLIGENT-TIERING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       get-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Gets  the  S3  Intelligent-Tiering  configuration  from  the  specified
       bucket.

       The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize  stor-
       age costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective stor-
       age access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3
       Intelligent-Tiering  delivers  automatic  cost savings in three low la-
       tency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage  cost
       on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to ac-
       tivate additional archiving capabilities.

       The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for
       data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, indepen-
       dent of object size or retention period. If the size of  an  object  is
       less  than  128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tier-
       ing. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at  the
       Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

       For  more  information,  see Storage class for automatically optimizing
       frequently and infrequently accessed objects .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose  configuration  you  want  to
          modify or retrieve.

       --id (string)
          The ID used to identify the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 WARNING:
                     Replacement  must be made for object keys containing spe-
                     cial characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML
                     requests.  For  more  information, see XML related object

                 cates in order for the filter to apply.

              configuration.

              (structure)
                 The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to opti-
                 mize  storage  costs by automatically moving data to the most
                 cost-effective storage access tier, without additional opera-
                 tional overhead.

                 Days -> (integer)
                     The  number  of consecutive days of no access after which
                     an object will be eligible to be transitioned to the cor-
                     responding tier. The minimum number of days specified for
                     Archive Access tier must be at least 90 days and Deep Ar-
                     chive  Access tier must be at least 180 days. The maximum
                     can be up to 2 years (730 days).

                 AccessTier -> (string)
                     S3 Intelligent-Tiering access tier. See Storage class for
                     automatically  optimizing frequently and infrequently ac-
                     cessed objects for a list of access tiers in the  S3  In-
                     telligent-Tiering storage class.
