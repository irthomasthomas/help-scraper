GET-OBJECT-TAGGING()                                      GET-OBJECT-TAGGING()



NAME
       get-object-tagging -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Returns  the tag-set of an object. You send the GET request against the
       tagging subresource associated with the object.

       To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:GetO-
       bjectTagging  action.  By  default,  the GET action returns information
       about current version of an object. For a  versioned  bucket,  you  can
       have multiple versions of an object in your bucket. To retrieve tags of
       any other version, use the versionId query  parameter.  You  also  need
       permission for the s3:GetObjectVersionTagging action.

       By  default,  the  bucket  owner has this permission and can grant this
       permission to others.

       For information about the Amazon S3 object tagging feature, see  Object
       Tagging .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  bucket  name containing the object for which to get the tagging
          information.
              Access points - When you use this action with an  access  point,
              you  must  provide the alias of the access point in place of the
              bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the  ac-
              cess  point  ARN,  you  must direct requests to the access point
              hostname. The access point hostname takes the form  AccessPoint-
              Name  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com. When
              using this action with an access point through  the  Amazon  Web
              Services  SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the
              bucket name. For more information about access point  ARNs,  see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts  hostname.
              The  S3  on  Outposts hostname takes the form `` AccessPointName
              -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` .
              When  you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon
              Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN  in
              place  of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Out-
              posts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the  Amazon  S3  User
              Guide .

       --key (string)
          Object key for which to get the tagging information.

       --version-id (string)
          The  versionId  of  the object for which to get the tagging informa-
          tion.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has  Requester
          Pays  enabled,  the  requester will pay for corresponding charges to
          copy the object. For information about downloading objects from  Re-
          quester  Pays  buckets,  see  Downloading  Objects in Requester Pays
          Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the tags attached to an object

       The following get-object-tagging example retrieves the values  for  the
       specified key from the specified object.

          aws s3api get-object-tagging \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key doc1.rtf

       Output:

          {
              "TagSet": [
                  {
                      "Value": "confidential",
                      "Key": "designation"
                  }
              ]
          }

       The following get-object-tagging example tries to retrieve the tag sets
       of the object doc2.rtf, which has no tags.

          aws s3api get-object-tagging \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key doc2.rtf

       Output:

          {
              "TagSet": []
          }

       The following get-object-tagging example retrieves the tag sets of  the
       object doc3.rtf, which has multiple tags.

          aws s3api get-object-tagging \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key doc3.rtf

       Output:

          {
              "TagSet": [
                  {
                      "Value": "confidential",
                      "Key": "designation"
                  },
                  {
                      "Value": "finance",
                      "Key": "department"
                  },
                  {
                      "Value": "payroll",
                      "Key": "team"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       VersionId -> (string)
          The  versionId  of the object for which you got the tagging informa-
          tion.

       TagSet -> (list)
          Contains the tag set.

          (structure)
              A container of a key value name pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 Name of the object key.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag.
