GET-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()                                GET-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()



NAME
       get-bucket-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  default encryption configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket.
       By default, all buckets have a default  encryption  configuration  that
       uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

       NOTE:

          o General purpose buckets - For information about the bucket default
            encryption feature, see Amazon S3 Bucket Default Encryption in the
            Amazon S3 User Guide .

          o Directory buckets - For directory buckets, there are only two sup-
            ported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. For
            information  about  the default encryption configuration in direc-
            tory buckets, see Setting default server-side encryption  behavior
            for directory buckets .

          Permissions

       o General  purpose  bucket permissions - The s3:GetEncryptionConfigura-
         tion permission is required in a policy. The bucket  owner  has  this
         permission  by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to
         others. For more information about permissions, see  Permissions  Re-
         lated  to  Bucket  Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your
         Amazon S3 Resources .

       o Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation,
         you  must have the s3express:GetEncryptionConfiguration permission in
         an IAM identity-based policy instead of a  bucket  policy.  Cross-ac-
         count  access  to  this API operation isn't supported. This operation
         can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services  account  that  owns
         the  resource.  For  more information about directory bucket policies
         and permissions, see Amazon Web Services Identity and Access  Manage-
         ment (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket from which the server-side encryption config-
          uration is retrieved.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket,  you  must  use  path-style  requests  in   the   format
              https://s3express-control.*region_code*                 .amazon-
              aws.com/*bucket-name* `` . Virtual-hosted-style requests  aren't
              supported.  Directory  bucket names must be unique in the chosen
              Availability Zone. Bucket names must also follow the  format  ``
              *bucket_base_name*  --*az_id*  --x-s3 (for example, `` DOC-EXAM-
              PLE-BUCKET --usw2-az1 --x-s3`` ). For information  about  bucket
              naming  restrictions,  see  Directory bucket naming rules in the
              Amazon S3 User Guide

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

          NOTE:
              For directory buckets, this header is not supported in this  API
              operation.  If  you  specify this header, the request fails with
              the HTTP status code 501 Not Implemented .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the server-side encryption configuration for a bucket

       The  following  get-bucket-encryption example retrieves the server-side
       encryption configuration for the bucket my-bucket.

          aws s3api get-bucket-encryption \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": {
                  "Rules": [
                      {
                          "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                              "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"
                          }
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
          Specifies the default server-side-encryption configuration.

          Rules -> (list)
              Container for information about a particular server-side encryp-
              tion configuration rule.

              (structure)
                 Specifies the default server-side encryption configuration.

                 NOTE:

                     o General  purpose  buckets - If you're specifying a cus-
                       tomer managed KMS key, we recommend using a fully qual-
                       ified  KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead,
                       then KMS resolves the key  within  the  requesters  ac-
                       count.  This  behavior  can  result  in data that's en-
                       crypted with a KMS key that belongs to  the  requester,
                       and not the bucket owner.

                     o Directory  buckets  -  When you specify an KMS customer
                       managed key for encryption in  your  directory  bucket,
                       only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of
                       the KMS key isn't supported.

                 ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault -> (structure)
                     Specifies the default server-side encryption to apply  to
                     new  objects  in  the  bucket.  If  a  PUT Object request
                     doesn't specify any server-side encryption, this  default
                     encryption will be applied.

                     SSEAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Server-side  encryption  algorithm  to use for the de-
                        fault encryption.

                        NOTE:
                            For directory buckets, there  are  only  two  sup-
                            ported  values  for server-side encryption: AES256
                            and aws:kms .

                     KMSMasterKeyID -> (string)
                        Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)  cus-
                        tomer  managed  key  ID to use for the default encryp-
                        tion.

                        NOTE:

                            o General purpose buckets - This parameter is  al-
                              lowed  if  and  only  if  SSEAlgorithm is set to
                              aws:kms or aws:kms:dsse .

                            o Directory buckets - This parameter is allowed if
                              and only if SSEAlgorithm is set to aws:kms .

                        You  can  specify the key ID, key alias, or the Amazon
                        Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.

                        o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        o Key                                             ARN:
                          arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        o Key Alias: alias/alias-name

                        If you are using encryption with cross-account or Ama-
                        zon  Web  Services  service operations, you must use a
                        fully qualified KMS key ARN. For more information, see
                        Using encryption for cross-account operations .

                        NOTE:

                            o General purpose buckets - If you're specifying a
                              customer managed KMS key, we recommend  using  a
                              fully  qualified  KMS  key ARN. If you use a KMS
                              key alias instead, then  KMS  resolves  the  key
                              within the requesters account. This behavior can
                              result in data that's encrypted with a  KMS  key
                              that  belongs  to  the  requester,  and  not the
                              bucket owner. Also, if you use a key ID, you can
                              run  into  a  LogDestination undeliverable error
                              when creating a VPC flow log.

                            o Directory buckets - When you specify an KMS cus-
                              tomer  managed key for encryption in your direc-
                              tory bucket, only use the key ID or key ARN. The
                              key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported.

                        WARNING:
                            Amazon  S3  only supports symmetric encryption KMS
                            keys. For more information, see Asymmetric keys in
                            Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon Web Services
                            Key Management Service Developer Guide .

                 BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3  Bucket  Key
                     with  server-side  encryption using KMS (SSE-KMS) for new
                     objects in the bucket. Existing objects are not affected.
                     Setting  the BucketKeyEnabled element to true causes Ama-
                     zon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key.

                     NOTE:

                        o General purpose buckets - By default, S3 Bucket  Key
                          is  not enabled. For more information, see Amazon S3
                          Bucket Keys in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                        o Directory buckets - S3 Bucket Keys  are  always  en-
                          abled  for  GET  and  PUT  operations in a directory
                          bucket and cant be disabled. S3 Bucket  Keys  aren't
                          supported,  when  you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects
                          from general purpose buckets to  directory  buckets,
                          from  directory  buckets to general purpose buckets,
                          or between directory buckets, through  CopyObject  ,
                          UploadPartCopy  , the Copy operation in Batch Opera-
                          tions , or the import jobs . In this case, Amazon S3
                          makes  a  call  to  KMS every time a copy request is
                          made for a KMS-encrypted object.
