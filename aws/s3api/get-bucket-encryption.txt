GET-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()                                GET-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()



NAME
       get-bucket-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Returns  the  default encryption configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket.
       By default, all buckets have a default  encryption  configuration  that
       uses  server-side  encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). For
       information about the bucket default encryption feature, see Amazon  S3
       Bucket Default Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       To  use  this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:Ge-
       tEncryptionConfiguration action. The bucket owner has  this  permission
       by  default.  The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For
       more information about permissions, see Permissions Related  to  Bucket
       Subresource  Operations  and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon
       S3 Resources .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket from which the server-side encryption config-
          uration is retrieved.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the server-side encryption configuration for a bucket

       The  following  get-bucket-encryption example retrieves the server-side
       encryption configuration for the bucket my-bucket.

          aws s3api get-bucket-encryption \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": {
                  "Rules": [
                      {
                          "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                              "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"
                          }
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
          Specifies the default server-side-encryption configuration.

          Rules -> (list)
              Container for information about a particular server-side encryp-
              tion configuration rule.

              (structure)
                 Specifies the default server-side encryption configuration.

                 ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the default server-side encryption to apply to
                     new objects in  the  bucket.  If  a  PUT  Object  request
                     doesn't  specify any server-side encryption, this default
                     encryption will be applied.

                     SSEAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Server-side encryption algorithm to use  for  the  de-
                        fault encryption.

                     KMSMasterKeyID -> (string)
                        Amazon  Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) cus-
                        tomer Amazon Web Services KMS key ID to  use  for  the
                        default  encryption.  This parameter is allowed if and
                        only if SSEAlgorithm is set to aws:kms .

                        You can specify the key ID, key alias, or  the  Amazon
                        Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.

                        o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        o Key                                             ARN:
                          arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        o Key Alias: alias/alias-name

                        If you use a key ID, you can run into a LogDestination
                        undeliverable error when creating a VPC flow log.

                        If you are using encryption with cross-account or Ama-
                        zon  Web  Services  service  operations you must use a
                        fully qualified KMS key ARN. For more information, see
                        Using encryption for cross-account operations .

                        WARNING:
                            Amazon  S3  only supports symmetric encryption KMS
                            keys. For more information, see Asymmetric keys in
                            Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon Web Services
                            Key Management Service Developer Guide .

                 BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3  Bucket  Key
                     with  server-side  encryption using KMS (SSE-KMS) for new
                     objects in the bucket. Existing objects are not affected.
                     Setting  the BucketKeyEnabled element to true causes Ama-
                     zon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key. By default, S3 Bucket Key
                     is not enabled.

                     For  more  information,  see Amazon S3 Bucket Keys in the
                     Amazon S3 User Guide .
