GET-OBJECT()                                                      GET-OBJECT()



NAME
       get-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves an object from Amazon S3.

       In the GetObject request, specify the full key name for the object.
          General purpose buckets - Both the virtual-hosted-style requests and
          the path-style requests are supported. For  a  virtual  hosted-style
          request  example,  if  you have the object photos/2006/February/sam-
          ple.jpg , specify the object key name as  /photos/2006/February/sam-
          ple.jpg  .  For a path-style request example, if you have the object
          photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket  ,
          specify  the  object  key  name as /examplebucket/photos/2006/Febru-
          ary/sample.jpg . For more information about request types, see  HTTP
          Host Header Bucket Specification in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Directory  buckets  -  Only  virtual-hosted-style  requests are sup-
          ported. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have  the
          object  photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named example-
          bucket--use1-az5--x-s3 ,  specify  the  object  key  name  as  /pho-
          tos/2006/February/sample.jpg  . Also, when you make requests to this
          API operation, your requests are sent to the Zonal  endpoint.  These
          endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
          ``
          https://bucket_name      .s3express-az_id     .*region*     .amazon-
          aws.com/key-name `` . Path-style requests  are  not  supported.  For
          more  information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 30)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.
              Permissions

       o General purpose bucket permissions - You must have the required  per-
         missions  in  a policy. To use GetObject , you must have the READ ac-
         cess to the object (or version). If you  grant  READ  access  to  the
         anonymous  user,  the  GetObject operation returns the object without
         using an authorization header. For more information,  see  Specifying
         permissions  in a policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide . If you include
         a versionId in your request  header,  you  must  have  the  s3:GetOb-
         jectVersion permission to access a specific version of an object. The
         s3:GetObject permission is not required in this scenario. If you  re-
         quest  the  current version of an object without a specific versionId
         in the request header, only the s3:GetObject permission is  required.
         The  s3:GetObjectVersion permission is not required in this scenario.
         If the object that you request doesnt exist, the error that Amazon S3
         returns  depends  on  whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permis-
         sion.

         o If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket,  Amazon  S3
           returns an HTTP status code 404 Not Found error.

         o If you dont have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an
           HTTP status code 403 Access Denied error.

       o Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API  operation
         on  a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the ` CreateSession
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html`__
         API  operation  for  session-based  authorization.  Specifically, you
         grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory  bucket
         in  a  bucket  policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make
         the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a  session  token.
         With  the  session token in your request header, you can make API re-
         quests to this operation. After the session token expires,  you  make
         another  CreateSession  API  call to generate a new session token for
         use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and  refresh  the
         session  token  automatically  to  avoid service interruptions when a
         session expires. For more information about authorization, see ` Cre-
         ateSession
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html`__
         .

         Storage classes

       If  the  object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible
       Retrieval storage class, the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, the
       S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier, or the S3 Intelligent-Tier-
       ing Deep Archive Access tier, before you can retrieve  the  object  you
       must  first restore a copy using RestoreObject . Otherwise, this opera-
       tion returns an InvalidObjectState error. For information about restor-
       ing  archived  objects, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon S3
       User Guide .
          Directory buckets - For directory buckets, only the S3  Express  One
          Zone  storage class is supported to store newly created objects. Un-
          supported storage class values won't write a destination object  and
          will respond with the HTTP status code 400 Bad Request .
              Encryption

       Encryption  request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption , should
       not be sent for the GetObject requests, if your object uses server-side
       encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3), server-side
       encryption  with  Key  Management  Service  (KMS)  keys  (SSE-KMS),  or
       dual-layer  server-side  encryption  with  Amazon Web Services KMS keys
       (DSSE-KMS). If you include the header in your  GetObject  requests  for
       the object that uses these types of keys, youll get an HTTP 400 Bad Re-
       quest error.
          Overriding response header values through the request

       There are times when you want to override certain response header  val-
       ues  of  a GetObject response. For example, you might override the Con-
       tent-Disposition response header value through your GetObject request.

       You can override values for a set of response headers.  These  modified
       response header values are included only in a successful response, that
       is, when the HTTP status code 200 OK is returned. The headers  you  can
       override using the following query parameters in the request are a sub-
       set of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object.

       The response headers that you can override for the  GetObject  response
       are  Cache-Control  ,  Content-Disposition  ,  Content-Encoding  , Con-
       tent-Language , Content-Type , and Expires .

       To override values for a set of response headers in the  GetObject  re-
       sponse, you can use the following query parameters in the request.

       o response-cache-control

       o response-content-disposition

       o response-content-encoding

       o response-content-language

       o response-content-type

       o response-expires

       NOTE:
              When  you use these parameters, you must sign the request by us-
              ing either an Authorization header or a presigned URL. These pa-
              rameters cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.

              HTTP Host header syntax

          Directory  buckets  -  The HTTP Host header syntax is `` Bucket_name
          .s3express-az_id .*region* .amazonaws.com`` .

       The following operations are related to GetObject :

       o ListBuckets

       o GetObjectAcl

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name containing the object.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
              `` Bucket_name  .s3express-az_id  .*region*  .amazonaws.com``  .
              Path-style  requests  are  not supported. Directory bucket names
              must be unique in the chosen  Availability  Zone.  Bucket  names
              must follow the format `` bucket_base_name --az-id --x-s3`` (for
              example, `` DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --usw2-az1 --x-s3`` ). For infor-
              mation  about  bucket  naming restrictions, see Directory bucket
              naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Access points - When you use this action with an  access  point,
              you  must  provide the alias of the access point in place of the
              bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the  ac-
              cess  point  ARN,  you  must direct requests to the access point
              hostname. The access point hostname takes the form  AccessPoint-
              Name  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com. When
              using this action with an access point through  the  Amazon  Web
              Services  SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the
              bucket name. For more information about access point  ARNs,  see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Object  Lambda  access points - When you use this action with an
              Object Lambda access point, you must direct requests to the  Ob-
              ject  Lambda  access  point  hostname.  The Object Lambda access
              point hostname takes the form AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-ob-
              ject-lambda.*Region* .amazonaws.com.

          NOTE:
                 Access  points  and  Object Lambda access points are not sup-
                 ported by directory buckets.

              S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts,  you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname.
              The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the  form  ``  AccessPointName
              -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` .
              When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the  Amazon
              Web  Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in
              place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on  Out-
              posts  ARNs,  see  What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User
              Guide .

       --if-match (string)
          Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same  as  the
          one  specified  in this header; otherwise, return a 412 Precondition
          Failed error.

          If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are  present
          in  the  request  as follows: If-Match condition evaluates to true ,
          and; If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false ; then, S3 re-
          turns 200 OK and the data requested.

          For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .

       --if-modified-since (timestamp)
          Return  the  object only if it has been modified since the specified
          time; otherwise, return a 304 Not Modified error.

          If both of  the  If-None-Match  and  If-Modified-Since  headers  are
          present  in the request as follows:If-None-Match condition evaluates
          to false , and; If-Modified-Since  condition  evaluates  to  true  ;
          then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified status code.

          For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .

       --if-none-match (string)
          Return  the  object  only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from
          the one specified in this header; otherwise, return a 304 Not  Modi-
          fied error.

          If  both  of  the  If-None-Match  and  If-Modified-Since headers are
          present in the request as follows:If-None-Match condition  evaluates
          to  false  ,  and;  If-Modified-Since  condition evaluates to true ;
          then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified HTTP status code.

          For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .

       --if-unmodified-since (timestamp)
          Return the object only if it has not been modified since the  speci-
          fied time; otherwise, return a 412 Precondition Failed error.

          If  both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present
          in the request as follows: If-Match condition evaluates  to  true  ,
          and; If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false ; then, S3 re-
          turns 200 OK and the data requested.

          For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .

       --key (string)
          Key of the object to get.

       --range (string)
          Downloads the specified byte range of an object. For  more  informa-
          tion       about      the      HTTP      Range      header,      see
          https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-range .

          NOTE:
              Amazon S3 doesn't support retrieving multiple ranges of data per
              GET request.

       --response-cache-control (string)
          Sets the Cache-Control header of the response.

       --response-content-disposition (string)
          Sets the Content-Disposition header of the response.

       --response-content-encoding (string)
          Sets the Content-Encoding header of the response.

       --response-content-language (string)
          Sets the Content-Language header of the response.

       --response-content-type (string)
          Sets the Content-Type header of the response.

       --response-expires (timestamp)
          Sets the Expires header of the response.

       --version-id (string)
          Version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.

          By  default,  the GetObject operation returns the current version of
          an object. To return a different version, use the  versionId  subre-
          source.

          NOTE:

              o If  you  include  a versionId in your request header, you must
                have the s3:GetObjectVersion permission to access  a  specific
                version  of  an object. The s3:GetObject permission is not re-
                quired in this scenario.

              o If you request the current version of an object without a spe-
                cific  versionId  in the request header, only the s3:GetObject
                permission is required. The s3:GetObjectVersion permission  is
                not required in this scenario.

              o Directory  buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported
                for directory buckets. For this API operation, only  the  null
                value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You
                can only specify null to the versionId query parameter in  the
                request.

          For more information about versioning, see PutBucketVersioning .

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the object (for exam-
          ple, AES256 ).

          If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption  with  cus-
          tomer-provided  encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in
          Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the  following
          headers:

          o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

          o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

          o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

          For  more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using
          Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key that  you  originally
          provided  for  Amazon S3 to encrypt the data before storing it. This
          value is used to decrypt the object  when  recovering  it  and  must
          match  the one used when storing the data. The key must be appropri-
          ate   for   use   with    the    algorithm    specified    in    the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

          If  you  encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with cus-
          tomer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object  in
          Amazon  S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following
          headers:

          o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

          o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

          o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

          For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption  (Using
          Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the customer-provided encryption
          key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a  message
          integrity  check  to  ensure that the encryption key was transmitted
          without error.

          If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption  with  cus-
          tomer-provided  encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in
          Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the  following
          headers:

          o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

          o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

          o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

          For  more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using
          Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has  Requester
          Pays  enabled,  the  requester will pay for corresponding charges to
          copy the object. For information about downloading objects from  Re-
          quester  Pays  buckets,  see  Downloading  Objects in Requester Pays
          Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --part-number (integer)
          Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer be-
          tween  1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' GET request for
          the part specified. Useful for downloading just a part of an object.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --checksum-mode (string)
          To retrieve the checksum, this mode must be enabled.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

GLOBAL OPTIONS

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following example uses the get-object command to download an object
       from Amazon S3:

          aws s3api get-object --bucket text-content --key dir/my_images.tar.bz2 my_images.tar.bz2

       Note that the outfile parameter is specified  without  an  option  name
       such  as  "--outfile". The name of the output file must be the last pa-
       rameter in the command.

       The example below demonstrates the use of --range to  download  a  spe-
       cific  byte range from an object. Note the byte ranges needs to be pre-
       fixed with "bytes=":

          aws s3api get-object --bucket text-content --key dir/my_data --range bytes=8888-9999 my_data_range

       For more information about retrieving objects, see Getting  Objects  in
       the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Body -> (streaming blob)
          Object data.

       DeleteMarker -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false)
          a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not  appear  in
          the response.

          NOTE:

              o If  the current version of the object is a delete marker, Ama-
                zon S3 behaves as if  the  object  was  deleted  and  includes
                x-amz-delete-marker: true in the response.

              o If  the  specified  version in the request is a delete marker,
                the response returns a 405 Method Not Allowed  error  and  the
                Last-Modified: timestamp response header.

       AcceptRanges -> (string)
          Indicates that a range of bytes was specified in the request.

          figuration
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html`__
          ), the response includes this header. It  includes  the  expiry-date
          and rule-id key-value pairs providing object expiration information.
          The value of the rule-id is URL-encoded.

          NOTE:

              buckets to store objects.

       LastModified -> (timestamp)
          Date and time when the object was last modified.
              General  purpose  buckets  - When you specify a versionId of the
              object in your request, if the specified version in the  request
              is  a  delete  marker, the response returns a 405 Method Not Al-
              lowed error and the Last-Modified: timestamp response header.

       ContentLength -> (long)
          Size of the body in bytes.

          The  base64-encoded,  32-bit CRC32 checksum of the object. This will
          only be present if it was uploaded with the object. For more  infor-
          mation, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       ChecksumCRC32C -> (string)
          The  base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC32C checksum of the object. This will
          only be present if it was uploaded with the object. For more  infor-
          mation, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       ChecksumSHA1 -> (string)
          The  base64-encoded,  160-bit  SHA-1 digest of the object. This will

          headers that are prefixed with x-amz-meta- . This can happen if  you
          create  metadata  using an API like SOAP that supports more flexible
          metadata than the REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can  create
          metadata whose values are not legal HTTP headers.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       VersionId -> (string)
