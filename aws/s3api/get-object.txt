GET-OBJECT()                                                      GET-OBJECT()



NAME
       get-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  objects  from Amazon S3. To use GET , you must have READ ac-
       cess to the object. If you grant READ access to the anonymous user, you
       can return the object without using an authorization header.

       An  Amazon  S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find
       in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create  a  logical
       hierarchy  by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For
       example, instead of naming an object sample.jpg , you can name it  pho-
       tos/2006/February/sample.jpg .

       To  get  an  object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key
       name for the object in the GET operation. For  a  virtual  hosted-style
       request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg
       , specify the resource  as  /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg  .  For  a
       path-style  request  example, if you have the object photos/2006/Febru-
       ary/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket , specify the resource
       as  /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg  . For more informa-
       tion about request types, see HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification .

       For more  information  about  returning  the  ACL  of  an  object,  see
       GetObjectAcl .

       If  the  object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible
       Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive  storage  class,  or  S3  Intelli-
       gent-Tiering  Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, be-
       fore you can retrieve the object you must first restore  a  copy  using
       RestoreObject  .  Otherwise,  this action returns an InvalidObjectState
       error. For information about restoring archived objects, see  Restoring
       Archived Objects .

       Encryption  request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption , should
       not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption
       with   Key   Management   Service   (KMS)  keys  (SSE-KMS),  dual-layer
       server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or
       server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3).
       If your object does use these types of keys, youll get an HTTP 400  Bad
       Request error.

       If  you  encrypt  an  object  by using server-side encryption with cus-
       tomer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you  store  the  object  in
       Amazon  S3,  then  when  you GET the object, you must use the following
       headers:

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

       For more information about SSE-C,  see  Server-Side  Encryption  (Using
       Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) .

       Assuming  you have the relevant permission to read object tags, the re-
       sponse also returns the x-amz-tagging-count header  that  provides  the
       count  of  number  of  tags  associated  with  the  object. You can use
       GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.
          Permissions

       You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this  op-
       eration. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy .
       If the object that you request doesnt exist, the error that  Amazon  S3
       returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.

       If  you  have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 re-
       turns an HTTP status code 404 (Not Found) error.

       If you dont have the s3:ListBucket permission,  Amazon  S3  returns  an
       HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.
          Versioning

       By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To
       return a different version, use the versionId subresource.

       NOTE:

          o If you supply a versionId , you need the s3:GetObjectVersion  per-
            mission  to access a specific version of an object. If you request
            a specific version, you do not need to have the s3:GetObject  per-
            mission.  If  you  request  the current version without a specific
            version ID, only s3:GetObject permission  is  required.  s3:GetOb-
            jectVersion permission won't be required.

          o If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3
            behaves   as   if   the   object   was   deleted   and    includes
            x-amz-delete-marker: true in the response.

       For more information about versioning, see PutBucketVersioning .
          Overriding Response Header Values

       There  are times when you want to override certain response header val-
       ues in a GET response. For example, you might override the Content-Dis-
       position response header value in your GET request.

       You can override values for a set of response headers using the follow-
       ing query parameters. These response header values are sent only  on  a
       successful  request,  that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The
       set of headers you can override using these parameters is a  subset  of
       the  headers  that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The re-
       sponse headers that you can override for  the  GET  response  are  Con-
       tent-Type , Content-Language , Expires , Cache-Control , Content-Dispo-
       sition , and Content-Encoding . To override these header values in  the
       GET response, you use the following request parameters.

       NOTE:
          You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a
          presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with
          an unsigned (anonymous) request.

       o response-content-type

       o response-content-language

       o response-expires

       o response-cache-control

       o response-content-disposition

       o response-content-encoding

         Overriding Response Header Values

       If  both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in
       the request as follows: If-Match condition evaluates  to  true  ,  and;
       If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false ; then, S3 returns 200
       OK and the data requested.

       If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are  present
       in  the request as follows:If-None-Match condition evaluates to false ,
       and; If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true ; then,  S3  returns
       304 Not Modified response code.

       For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name containing the object.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using an Object Lambda access point the hostname takes the form
          AccessPointName   -AccountId   .s3-object-lambda.*Region*   .amazon-
          aws.com.

          When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form `` AccessPointName -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` . When you use this action  with  S3
          on  Outposts  through  the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the
          Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more  in-
          formation  about  S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --if-match (string)
          Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same  as  the
          one specified; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.

       --if-modified-since (timestamp)
          Return  the  object only if it has been modified since the specified
          time; otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.

       --if-none-match (string)
          Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag)  is  different  from
          the one specified; otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.

       --if-unmodified-since (timestamp)
          Return  the object only if it has not been modified since the speci-
          fied time; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.

       --key (string)
          Key of the object to get.

       --range (string)
          Downloads the specified range bytes of an object. For more  informa-
          tion       about      the      HTTP      Range      header,      see
          https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-range .

          NOTE:
              Amazon S3 doesn't support retrieving multiple ranges of data per
              GET request.

       --response-cache-control (string)
          Sets the Cache-Control header of the response.

       --response-content-disposition (string)
          Sets the Content-Disposition header of the response

       --response-content-encoding (string)
          Sets the Content-Encoding header of the response.

       --response-content-language (string)
          Sets the Content-Language header of the response.

       --response-content-type (string)
          Sets the Content-Type header of the response.

       --response-expires (timestamp)
          Sets the Expires header of the response.

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies  the  algorithm  to use to when decrypting the object (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 used to
          encrypt  the data. This value is used to decrypt the object when re-
          covering it and must match the one used when storing the  data.  The
          key  must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according  to
          RFC  1321.  Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. For information about  downloading  objects  from  Requester
          Pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --part-number (integer)
          Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer be-
          tween  1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' GET request for
          the part specified. Useful for downloading just a part of an object.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --checksum-mode (string)
          To retrieve the checksum, this mode must be enabled.

          Possible values:

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following example uses the get-object command to download an object
       from Amazon S3:

          aws s3api get-object --bucket text-content --key dir/my_images.tar.bz2 my_images.tar.bz2

       Note that the outfile parameter is specified  without  an  option  name
       such  as  "--outfile". The name of the output file must be the last pa-
       rameter in the command.

       The example below demonstrates the use of --range to  download  a  spe-
       cific  byte range from an object. Note the byte ranges needs to be pre-
       fixed with "bytes=":

          aws s3api get-object --bucket text-content --key dir/my_data --range bytes=8888-9999 my_data_range

       For more information about retrieving objects, see Getting  Objects  in
       the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Body -> (streaming blob)

       DeleteMarker -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false)
          a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not  appear  in
          the response.

       AcceptRanges -> (string)
          Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

       Expiration -> (string)
          If  the  object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle),
          the response includes this header. It includes the  expiry-date  and
          rule-id key-value pairs providing object expiration information. The
          value of the rule-id is URL-encoded.

       Restore -> (string)
          Provides information about object restoration action and  expiration
          time of the restored object copy.

       LastModified -> (timestamp)
          Creation date of the object.

       ContentLength -> (long)
          Size of the body in bytes.

       ETag -> (string)
          An  entity  tag  (ETag)  is  an  opaque identifier assigned by a web
          server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.

       ChecksumCRC32 -> (string)
          The base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC32 checksum of the object.  This  will
          only  be  present if it was uploaded with the object. With multipart
          uploads, this may not be a checksum value of the  object.  For  more
          information  about  how  checksums are calculated with multipart up-
          loads, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       ChecksumCRC32C -> (string)
          The base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC32C checksum of the object. This  will
          only  be  present if it was uploaded with the object. With multipart
          uploads, this may not be a checksum value of the  object.  For  more
          information  about  how  checksums are calculated with multipart up-
          loads, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       ChecksumSHA1 -> (string)
          The base64-encoded, 160-bit SHA-1 digest of the  object.  This  will
          only  be  present if it was uploaded with the object. With multipart
          uploads, this may not be a checksum value of the  object.  For  more
          information  about  how  checksums are calculated with multipart up-
          loads, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       ChecksumSHA256 -> (string)
          The base64-encoded, 256-bit SHA-256 digest of the object. This  will
          only  be  present if it was uploaded with the object. With multipart
          uploads, this may not be a checksum value of the  object.  For  more
          information  about  how  checksums are calculated with multipart up-
          loads, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       MissingMeta -> (integer)
          This is set to the  number  of  metadata  entries  not  returned  in
          x-amz-meta  headers. This can happen if you create metadata using an
          API like SOAP that supports more flexible  metadata  than  the  REST
          API.  For  example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose values
          are not legal HTTP headers.

       VersionId -> (string)
          Version of the object.

       CacheControl -> (string)
          Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.

       ContentDisposition -> (string)
          Specifies presentational information for the object.

       ContentEncoding -> (string)
          Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
          thus  what  decoding  mechanisms  must  be applied to obtain the me-
          dia-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

       ContentLanguage -> (string)
          The language the content is in.

       ContentRange -> (string)
          The portion of the object returned in the response.

       ContentType -> (string)
          A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

       Expires -> (timestamp)
          The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

       WebsiteRedirectLocation -> (string)
          If the bucket is configured as a  website,  redirects  requests  for
          this  object  to another object in the same bucket or to an external
          URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the  object  meta-
          data.

       ServerSideEncryption -> (string)
          The  server-side  encryption algorithm used when storing this object
          in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256 , aws:kms , aws:kms:dsse ).

       Metadata -> (map)
          A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

          key -> (string)
