LIST-OBJECT-VERSIONS()                                  LIST-OBJECT-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-object-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata about all versions of the objects in a bucket. You can
       also use request parameters as selection criteria  to  return  metadata
       about a subset of all the object versions.

       WARNING:
          To  use  this  operation,  you  must  have permission to perform the
          s3:ListBucketVersions action. Be aware of the name difference.

       NOTE:
          A 200 OK response can contain valid or invalid XML. Make sure to de-
          sign your application to parse the contents of the response and han-
          dle it appropriately.

       To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket.

       The following operations are related to ListObjectVersions :

       o ListObjectsV2

       o GetObject

       o PutObject

       o DeleteObject

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-object-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Versions, DeleteMarkers, CommonPrefixes

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name that contains the objects.

       --delimiter (string)
          A  delimiter is a character that you specify to group keys. All keys
          that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occur-
          rence  of the delimiter are grouped under a single result element in
          CommonPrefixes . These groups are counted as one result against  the
          max-keys  limitation.  These  keys are not returned elsewhere in the
          response.

       --encoding-type (string)
          Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys  in  the  response  and
          specifies  the encoding method to use. An object key can contain any
          Unicode character; however, the XML 1.0  parser  cannot  parse  some
          characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For
          characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add  this  pa-
          rameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

          Possible values:

          o url

       --prefix (string)
          Use  this  parameter  to  select only those keys that begin with the
          specified prefix. You can use prefixes to  separate  a  bucket  into
          different  groupings of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make
          groups in the same way that you'd use a folder in  a  file  system.)
          You can use prefix with delimiter to roll up numerous objects into a
          single result under CommonPrefixes .

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. If either the source or destination Amazon S3 bucket has Re-
          quester  Pays  enabled,  the  requester  will  pay for corresponding
          charges to copy the object. For information  about  downloading  ob-
          jects  from  Requester  Pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Re-
          quester Pays Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --optional-object-attributes (list)
          Specifies the optional fields that you  want  returned  in  the  re-
          sponse. Fields that you do not specify are not returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            RestoreStatus

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command retrieves version information for an object in  a
       bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket my-bucket --prefix index.html

       Output:

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag that indicates whether Amazon S3 returned all of the results
          that satisfied the search criteria. If your results were  truncated,
          you  can  make  a  follow-up paginated request by using the NextKey-
          Marker and NextVersionIdMarker response  parameters  as  a  starting
          place in another request to return the rest of the results.

       KeyMarker -> (string)
          Marks the last key returned in a truncated response.

       VersionIdMarker -> (string)
          Marks the last version of the key returned in a truncated response.

       NextKeyMarker -> (string)
          When the number of responses exceeds the value of MaxKeys , NextKey-
          Marker specifies the first  key  not  returned  that  satisfies  the
          search criteria. Use this value for the key-marker request parameter
          in a subsequent request.

       NextVersionIdMarker -> (string)
          When the number of responses exceeds the value of MaxKeys , NextVer-
          sionIdMarker  specifies  the  first object version not returned that
          satisfies  the  search  criteria.  Use  this  value  for  the   ver-
          sion-id-marker request parameter in a subsequent request.

       Versions -> (list)
          Container for version information.

          (structure)
              The version of an object.

              ETag -> (string)
                 The entity tag is an MD5 hash of that version of the object.

              ChecksumAlgorithm -> (list)
                 The  algorithm  that was used to create a checksum of the ob-
                 ject.

                 (string)

              Size -> (long)
                 Size in bytes of the object.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The class of storage used to store the object.

              Key -> (string)
                 The object key.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 Version ID of an object.

              IsLatest -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the object is (true) or is not (false)  the
                 latest version of an object.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time when the object was last modified.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 Specifies the owner of the object.

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container  for  the display name of the owner. This value
                     is only supported in the following  Amazon  Web  Services
                     Regions:

                     o US East (N. Virginia)

                     o US West (N. California)

                     o US West (Oregon)

                     o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

                     o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                     o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                     o Europe (Ireland)

                     o South America (So Paulo)

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

              RestoreStatus -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  restoration  status  of an object. Objects in
                 certain storage classes must be restored before they  can  be
                 retrieved.  For  more information about these storage classes
                 and how to work  with  archived  objects,  see  Working  with
                 archived objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 IsRestoreInProgress -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the object is currently being restored.
                     If the object restoration is in progress, the header  re-
                     turns the value TRUE . For example:
                        x-amz-optional-object-attributes:         IsRestoreIn-
                        Progress="true"

                     If the object restoration has completed, the  header  re-
                     turns the value FALSE . For example:
                        x-amz-optional-object-attributes:         IsRestoreIn-
                        Progress="false",                       RestoreExpiry-
                        Date="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"

                     If  the  object  hasn't been restored, there is no header
                     response.

                 RestoreExpiryDate -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates when the restored copy will expire. This  value
                     is  populated  only  if  the  object has already been re-
                     stored. For example:
                        x-amz-optional-object-attributes:         IsRestoreIn-
                        Progress="false",                       RestoreExpiry-
                        Date="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"

       DeleteMarkers -> (list)

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container for the display name of the owner.  This  value
                     is  only  supported  in the following Amazon Web Services

                     o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                     o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                     o Europe (Ireland)

                     o South America (So Paulo)

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

              Key -> (string)

              VersionId -> (string)
                 Version ID of an object.

              IsLatest -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the object is (true) or is not (false)  the
                 latest version of an object.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time when the object was last modified.

       Name -> (string)
          The bucket name.

       Prefix -> (string)
          Selects  objects  that start with the value supplied by this parame-
          ter.

       Delimiter -> (string)
          The delimiter grouping the included keys. A delimiter is a character
          that  you  specify  to  group  keys.  All keys that contain the same
          string between the prefix and the first occurrence of the  delimiter
          are  grouped under a single result element in CommonPrefixes . These
          groups are counted as one result against  the  max-keys  limitation.
          These keys are not returned elsewhere in the response.

       MaxKeys -> (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of objects to return.

       CommonPrefixes -> (list)
          All of the keys rolled up into a common prefix count as a single re-
          turn when calculating the number of returns.

          (structure)
              Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the
              next  occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. Common-
              Prefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in  the  direc-
              tory  specified  by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/
              and the delimiter is a slash (/) as  in  notes/summer/july,  the
              common prefix is notes/summer/.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Container for the specified common prefix.

       EncodingType -> (string)
          Encoding  type  used  by Amazon S3 to encode object key names in the
          XML response.

          If you specify the encoding-type request parameter,  Amazon  S3  in-
          cludes  this  element  in the response, and returns encoded key name
          values in the following response elements:
              KeyMarker, NextKeyMarker, Prefix, Key , and Delimiter .

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.
