GET-BUCKET-WEBSITE()                                      GET-BUCKET-WEBSITE()



NAME
       get-bucket-website -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the website configuration for a bucket. To host website on Ama-
       zon S3, you can configure a bucket as website by adding a website  con-
       figuration.  For  more  information about hosting websites, see Hosting
       Websites on Amazon S3 .

       This GET action requires the  S3:GetBucketWebsite  permission.  By  de-
       fault, only the bucket owner can read the bucket website configuration.
       However, bucket owners can allow other users to read the  website  con-
       figuration  by  writing  a  bucket policy granting them the S3:GetBuck-
       etWebsite permission.

       The following operations are related to DeleteBucketWebsite :

       o DeleteBucketWebsite

       o PutBucketWebsite

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-website
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name for which to get the website configuration.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command retrieves the static website configuration for  a
       bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-website --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "IndexDocument": {
                  "Suffix": "index.html"
              },
              "ErrorDocument": {
                  "Key": "error.html"
              }
          }

          point of an Amazon S3 bucket.

          HostName -> (string)
              Name of the host where requests are redirected.

          Protocol -> (string)

              on the website endpoint (for example,if the suffix is index.html

              WARNING:
                 Replacement  must  be made for object keys containing special
                 characters (such as carriage  returns)  when  using  XML  re-

              WARNING:
                 Replacement  must  be made for object keys containing special
                 characters (such as carriage  returns)  when  using  XML  re-
                 quests. For more information, see XML related object key con-
                 straints .

       RoutingRules -> (list)
          Rules that define when a redirect is applied and the redirect behav-
          ior.

          (structure)
              Specifies  the redirect behavior and when a redirect is applied.
              For more information about routing rules,  see  Configuring  ad-
              vanced conditional redirects in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Condition -> (structure)
                 A  container  for describing a condition that must be met for
                 the specified redirect to apply. For example, 1.  If  request
                 is  for pages in the /docs folder, redirect to the /documents
                 folder. 2. If request results in HTTP error 4xx, redirect re-
                 quest to another host where you might process the error.

                 HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals -> (string)
                     The  HTTP error code when the redirect is applied. In the
                     event of an error, if the error code equals  this  value,
                     then  the  specified  redirect  is applied. Required when
                     parent element Condition is specified and sibling KeyPre-
                     fixEquals  is  not specified. If both are specified, then
                     both must be true for the redirect to be applied.

                 KeyPrefixEquals -> (string)
                     The object key name prefix when the redirect is  applied.
                     For  example, to redirect requests for ExamplePage.html ,
                     the key prefix will be ExamplePage.html . To redirect re-
                     quest  for all pages with the prefix docs/ , the key pre-
                     fix will be /docs , which identifies all objects  in  the
                     docs/  folder. Required when the parent element Condition
                     is specified and sibling  HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals  is
                     not  specified.  If  both  conditions are specified, both
                     must be true for the redirect to be applied.

                        Replacement must be made for  object  keys  containing
                        special characters (such as carriage returns) when us-
                        ing XML requests. For more information,  see  XML  re-

              Redirect -> (structure)
                 Container for redirect information. You can redirect requests
                 to another host, to another page, or with  another  protocol.
                 In  the  event of an error, you can specify a different error
                 code to return.

                 HostName -> (string)
                     The host name to use in the redirect request.

                 HttpRedirectCode -> (string)
                     The HTTP redirect code to use on the  response.  Not  re-
                     quired if one of the siblings is present.

                 Protocol -> (string)
                     Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The default is
                     the protocol that is used in the original request.

                 ReplaceKeyPrefixWith -> (string)
                     The object key prefix to use in the redirect request. For
                     example,  to  redirect requests for all pages with prefix
                     docs/ (objects in the docs/ folder) to documents/  ,  you
                     can  set  a  condition  block with KeyPrefixEquals set to
                     docs/ and in the  Redirect  set  ReplaceKeyPrefixWith  to
                     /documents  .  Not  required  if  one  of the siblings is
                     present. Can be present only  if  ReplaceKeyWith  is  not
                     provided.

                     quired if one of the siblings is present. Can be  present
                     only if ReplaceKeyPrefixWith is not provided.
