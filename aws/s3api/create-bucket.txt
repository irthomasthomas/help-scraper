CREATE-BUCKET()                                                CREATE-BUCKET()



NAME
       create-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  action  creates an Amazon S3 bucket. To create an Amazon S3 on
          Outposts         bucket,         see         `          CreateBucket
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html`__
          .

       Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must set up Amazon  S3
       and  have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate re-
       quests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By cre-
       ating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.

       There  are  two types of buckets: general purpose buckets and directory
       buckets. For more information about these bucket types,  see  Creating,
       configuring,  and  working with Amazon S3 buckets in the Amazon S3 User
       Guide .

       NOTE:

          o General purpose buckets - If you send your CreateBucket request to
            the  s3.amazonaws.com  global  endpoint,  the  request goes to the
            us-east-1 Region. So the signature calculations in Signature  Ver-
            sion 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location con-
            straint in the request specifies another Region where  the  bucket
            is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US
            East (N. Virginia), your application must be able  to  handle  307
            redirect.  For more information, see Virtual hosting of buckets in
            the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          o Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make  requests
            for  this  API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints
            support path-style requests in the format
            ``
            https://s3express-control.*region_code* .amazonaws.com/bucket-name
            ``  . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. For more in-
            formation, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3  User
            Guide .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 43)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          Permissions

       o General  purpose  bucket  permissions - In addition to the s3:Create-
         Bucket permission, the following permissions are required in a policy
         when your CreateBucket request includes specific headers:

         o Access  control lists (ACLs) - In your CreateBucket request, if you
           specify an access control list (ACL) and set it  to  public-read  ,
           public-read-write , authenticated-read , or if you explicitly spec-
           ify any other custom ACLs, both s3:CreateBucket and s3:PutBucketAcl
           permissions  are required. In your CreateBucket request, if you set
           the ACL to private , or if you don't specify  any  ACLs,  only  the
           s3:CreateBucket permission is required.

         o Object   Lock   -   In   your  CreateBucket  request,  if  you  set
           x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled to true,  the  s3:PutBucketObject-
           LockConfiguration  and  s3:PutBucketVersioning  permissions are re-
           quired.

         o S3 Object Ownership - If your  CreateBucket  request  includes  the
           x-amz-object-ownership  header,  then the s3:PutBucketOwnershipCon-
           trols permission is required.

         WARNING:
            If your CreateBucket request sets BucketOwnerEnforced  for  Amazon
            S3  Object  Ownership and specifies a bucket ACL that provides ac-
            cess to an external Amazon  Web  Services  account,  your  request
            fails  with a 400 error and returns the InvalidBucketAcLWithObjec-
            tOwnership error code. For more information,  see  Setting  Object
            Ownership on an existing bucket in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

         o S3  Block Public Access - If your specific use case requires grant-
           ing public access to your S3 resources, you can disable Block  Pub-
           lic  Access.  Specifically,  you can create a new bucket with Block
           Public Access enabled, then separately call the  `  DeletePublicAc-
           cessBlock
           https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeletePublicAccessBlock.html`__
           API. To use this operation, you must have the s3:PutBucketPublicAc-
           cessBlock permission. For more information about  S3  Block  Public
           Access, see Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage in the
           Amazon S3 User Guide .

       o Directory bucket permissions - You must  have  the  s3express:Create-
         Bucket permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket
         policy. Cross-account access to this API operation  isn't  supported.
         This  operation  can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services ac-
         count that owns the resource. For more  information  about  directory
         bucket policies and permissions, see Amazon Web Services Identity and
         Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User
         Guide .

       WARNING:
                 The  permissions  for ACLs, Object Lock, S3 Object Ownership,
                 and S3 Block Public Access are not  supported  for  directory
                 buckets.  For directory buckets, all Block Public Access set-
                 tings are enabled at the bucket level and S3 Object Ownership
                 is  set  to Bucket owner enforced (ACLs disabled). These set-
                 tings can't be modified.  For more information about  permis-
                 sions  for  creating  and working with directory buckets, see
                 Directory buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide . For more  in-
                 formation  about supported S3 features for directory buckets,
                 see Features of S3 Express One Zone in  the  Amazon  S3  User
                 Guide .

OPTIONS
       --acl (string)
          The canned ACL to apply to the bucket.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public-read

          o public-read-write

          o authenticated-read

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket to create.
              General purpose buckets - For information  about  bucket  naming
              restrictions,  see  Bucket  naming  rules  in the Amazon S3 User
              Guide .

              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket,   you   must  use  path-style  requests  in  the  format
              https://s3express-control.*region_code*                 .amazon-
              aws.com/*bucket-name*  `` . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't
              supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in  the  chosen
              Availability  Zone.  Bucket names must also follow the format ``
              *bucket_base_name* --*az_id* --x-s3 (for example,  ``  DOC-EXAM-
              PLE-BUCKET  --usw2-az2  --x-s3`` ). For information about bucket
              naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming  rules  in  the
              Amazon S3 User Guide

       --create-bucket-configuration (structure)
          The configuration information for the bucket.

          LocationConstraint -> (string)
              Specifies the Region where the bucket will be created. You might
              choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or  address
              regulatory  requirements.  For example, if you reside in Europe,
              you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in  the
              Europe  (Ireland)  Region. For more information, see Accessing a
              bucket in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              If you don't specify a Region, the bucket is created in  the  US
              East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1) by default.

              NOTE:
                 This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Location -> (structure)
              Specifies the location where the bucket will be created.

              For directory buckets, the location type is Availability Zone.

              NOTE:
                 This functionality is only supported by directory buckets.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of location where the bucket will be created.

              Name -> (string)

                 For  directory  buckets,  the  AZ ID of the Availability Zone
                 where the bucket will be created. An example AZ ID  value  is
                 usw2-az2 .

          Bucket -> (structure)
              Specifies the information about the bucket that will be created.

              NOTE:
                 This functionality is only supported by directory buckets.

              DataRedundancy -> (string)
                 The  number  of  Availability Zone that's used for redundancy
                 for the bucket.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

              "Type": "Directory"
            }
          }

       --grant-full-control (string)
          Allows grantee the read, write, read ACP, and write ACP  permissions
          on the bucket.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --grant-read (string)
          Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --grant-read-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to read the bucket ACL.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --grant-write (string)
          Allows grantee to create new objects in the bucket.

          For  the  bucket  and object owners of existing objects, also allows
          deletions and overwrites of those objects.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --grant-write-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable bucket.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --object-lock-enabled-for-bucket |  --no-object-lock-enabled-for-bucket
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether you want S3 Object Lock to be enabled for the new
          bucket.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --object-ownership (string)
          The container element for object ownership for a bucket's  ownership
          controls.
              BucketOwnerPreferred  -  Objects  uploaded  to the bucket change
              ownership to the bucket owner if the objects are  uploaded  with
              the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL.

              ObjectWriter  - The uploading account will own the object if the
              object is uploaded  with  the  bucket-owner-full-control  canned
              ACL.

              BucketOwnerEnforced  -  Access control lists (ACLs) are disabled
              and no longer affect permissions. The bucket owner automatically
              owns  and  has full control over every object in the bucket. The
              bucket only accepts PUT requests that don't specify  an  ACL  or
              specify  bucket  owner full control ACLs (such as the predefined
              bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL or a custom ACL in XML for-
              mat that grants the same permissions).

          By  default,  ObjectOwnership is set to BucketOwnerEnforced and ACLs
          are disabled. We recommend keeping ACLs disabled, except in uncommon
          use  cases  where  you must control access for each object individu-
          ally.  For  more  information  about  S3   Object   Ownership,   see
          Controlling  ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket
          in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory  buckets.  Di-
              rectory buckets use the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Ob-
              ject Ownership.

          Possible values:

          o BucketOwnerPreferred

          o ObjectWriter

          o BucketOwnerEnforced

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a bucket

       The following create-bucket example creates a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api create-bucket \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "Location": "/my-bucket"
          }

       For more information, see Creating a  bucket  in  the  Amazon  S3  User
       Guide.

       Example 2: To create a bucket with owner enforced

       The  following  create-bucket  example creates a bucket named my-bucket
       that uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership.

          aws s3api create-bucket \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --object-ownership BucketOwnerEnforced

       Output:

          {
              "Location": "/my-bucket"
          }

       For more information, see Controlling ownership  of  objects  and  dis-
       abling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

       Example 3: To create a bucket outside of the ``us-east-1`` region

       The following create-bucket example creates a bucket named my-bucket in
       the eu-west-1 region. Regions outside of us-east-1 require  the  appro-
       priate LocationConstraint to be specified in order to create the bucket
       in the desired region.

          aws s3api create-bucket \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --region eu-west-1 \
              --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-west-1

       Output:

          {
              "Location": "http://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/"
          }

       For more information, see Creating a  bucket  in  the  Amazon  S3  User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       Location -> (string)
          A forward slash followed by the name of the bucket.
