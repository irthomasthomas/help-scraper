RESTORE-OBJECT()                                              RESTORE-OBJECT()



NAME
       restore-object -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3

       This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       This action performs the following types of requests:

       o restore an archive - Restore an archived object

       For  more  information  about the S3 structure in the request body, see
       the following:

       o PutObject

       o Managing Access with ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide

       o Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the  Amazon  S3  User
         Guide

         Permissions

       To  use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Re-
       storeObject action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and
       can grant this permission to others. For more information about permis-
       sions, see Permissions Related to  Bucket  Subresource  Operations  and
       Managing  Access  Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon
       S3 User Guide .
          Restoring objects

       Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval  Flexible
       Retrieval  or  S3  Glacier  Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelli-
       gent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers,  are
       not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier Flexible Re-
       trieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage  classes,
       you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a tempo-
       rary copy of the object is available. If you want a permanent  copy  of
       the object, create a copy of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class
       in your S3 bucket. To access an archived object, you must  restore  the
       object  for the duration (number of days) that you specify. For objects
       in the Archive Access or Deep  Archive  Access  tiers  of  S3  Intelli-
       gent-Tiering,  you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait
       until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier.

       To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID.  If
       you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

       When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following
       data access tier options in the Tier element of the request body:

       o Expedited - Expedited retrievals allow you  to  quickly  access  your
         data  stored  in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval
         storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when  occasional
         urgent  requests for restoring archives are required. For all but the
         largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited re-
         trievals  is  typically made available within 15 minutes. Provisioned
         capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals  is
         available  when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned ca-
         pacity are not available for objects stored in the  S3  Glacier  Deep
         Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

       o Standard  -  Standard  retrievals  allow  you  to  access any of your
         archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for
         retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard
         retrievals typically finish within 35 hours for objects stored in the
         S3  Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3
         Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They  typically  finish  within  12
         hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class
         or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals  are
         free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

       o Bulk  -  Bulk  retrievals  free  for objects stored in the S3 Glacier
         Flexible Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering  storage  classes,  en-
         abling  you  to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data at no
         cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 512 hours  for  objects
         stored  in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval stor-
         age class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are
         also  the lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3
         Glacier Deep Archive. They typically finish within 48 hours  for  ob-
         jects  stored  in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 In-
         telligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

       For more information about archive retrieval  options  and  provisioned
       capacity  for  Expedited data access, see Restoring Archived Objects in
       the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed
       to  a  faster  speed while it is in progress. For more information, see
       Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore in  the  Amazon  S3  User
       Guide .

       To  get  the status of object restoration, you can send a HEAD request.
       Operations return the x-amz-restore header, which provides  information
       about  the  restoration  status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3
       event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated  or  com-
       pleted. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifica-
       tions in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration  pe-
       riod  by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the
       restoration period relative to the current time and  charges  only  for
       the  request-there  are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the
       restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing  your  current
       restore request for the object.

       If  your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes
       an expiration action, the object expiration  overrides  the  life  span
       that  you  specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an
       object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled  to  expire  in  3
       days,  Amazon  S3  deletes  the  object in 3 days. For more information
       about lifecycle configuration, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration  and
       Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon S3 User Guide .
          Responses

       A  successful  action  returns either the 200 OK or 202 Accepted status
       code.

       o If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns  202
         Accepted in the response.

       o If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK in the
         response.

       o Special errors:

         o Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress

         o Cause: Object restore is already in progress.

         o HTTP Status Code: 409 Conflict

         o SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client

       o

         o Code: GlacierExpeditedRetrievalNotAvailable

         o Cause: expedited retrievals are currently not available. Try  again
           later.  (Returned  if there is insufficient capacity to process the
           Expedited request. This error applies only to Expedited  retrievals
           and not to S3 Standard or Bulk retrievals.)

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name containing the object to restore.
              Access  points  - When you use this action with an access point,
              you must provide the alias of the access point in place  of  the
              bucket  name or specify the access point ARN. When using the ac-
              cess point ARN, you must direct requests  to  the  access  point
              hostname.  The access point hostname takes the form AccessPoint-
              Name -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When
              using  this  action  with an access point through the Amazon Web
              Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of  the
              bucket  name.  For more information about access point ARNs, see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts,  you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname.
              The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the  form  ``  AccessPointName
              -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` .
              When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the  Amazon
              Web  Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in
              place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on  Out-
              posts  ARNs,  see  What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User
              Guide .

       --key (string)
          Object key for which the action was initiated.

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --restore-request (structure)
          Container for restore job parameters.

          Days -> (integer)
              Lifetime of the active copy in days. Do not  use  with  restores
              that specify OutputLocation .

              The  Days element is required for regular restores, and must not
              be provided for select requests.

          GlacierJobParameters -> (structure)
              S3 Glacier related parameters pertaining to this job. Do not use
              with restores that specify OutputLocation .

              Tier -> (string)
                 Retrieval tier at which the restore will be processed.

          Type -> (string)
              Type of restore request.

          Tier -> (string)
              Retrieval tier at which the restore will be processed.

          Description -> (string)
              The optional description for the job.

          SelectParameters -> (structure)
              Describes the parameters for Select job types.

              InputSerialization -> (structure)
                 Describes the serialization format of the object.

                 CSV -> (structure)
                     Describes the serialization of a CSV-encoded object.

                     FileHeaderInfo -> (string)
                        Describes the first line of input. Valid values are:

                        o NONE : First line is not a header.

                        o IGNORE  :  First line is a header, but you can't use
                          the header values to indicate the column in  an  ex-
                          pression.  You  can use column position (such as _1,
                          _2, ) to indicate the column (SELECT s._1  FROM  OB-
                          JECT s ).

                        o Use  :  First  line is a header, and you can use the
                          header value to identify a column in  an  expression
                          (SELECT "name" FROM OBJECT ).

                     Comments -> (string)
                        A  single character used to indicate that a row should
                        be ignored when the character is present at the  start
                        of that row. You can specify any character to indicate
                        a comment line. The default character is # .

                        Default: #

                     QuoteEscapeCharacter -> (string)
                        A single character used  for  escaping  the  quotation
                        mark  character  inside  an already escaped value. For
                        example, the value """ a , b """ is parsed as " a ,  b
                        " .

                     RecordDelimiter -> (string)
                        A single character used to separate individual records
                        in the input. Instead of the default  value,  you  can
                        specify an arbitrary delimiter.

                     FieldDelimiter -> (string)
                        A  single character used to separate individual fields
                        in a record. You can specify an arbitrary delimiter.

                     QuoteCharacter -> (string)
                        A single character used for escaping  when  the  field
                        delimiter  is  part  of the value. For example, if the
                        value is a, b , Amazon S3 wraps this  field  value  in
                        quotation marks, as follows: " a , b " .

                        Type: String

                        Default: "

                        Ancestors: CSV

                     AllowQuotedRecordDelimiter -> (boolean)
                        Specifies  that  CSV  field  values may contain quoted
                        record delimiters and such records should be  allowed.
                        Default value is FALSE. Setting this value to TRUE may
                        lower performance.

                 CompressionType -> (string)
                     Specifies  object's  compression  format.  Valid  values:
                     NONE, GZIP, BZIP2. Default Value: NONE.

                 JSON -> (structure)
                     Specifies JSON as object's input serialization format.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of JSON. Valid values: Document, Lines.

                 Parquet -> (structure)
                     Specifies Parquet as object's input serialization format.

              ExpressionType -> (string)
                 The type of the provided expression (for example, SQL).

              Expression -> (string)
                 The expression that is used to query the object.

              OutputSerialization -> (structure)
                 Describes how the results of the Select job are serialized.

                 CSV -> (structure)
                     Describes  the  serialization  of  CSV-encoded Select re-
                     sults.

                     QuoteFields -> (string)
                        Indicates whether to use quotation marks around output
                        fields.

                        o ALWAYS  :  Always  use  quotation  marks  for output
                          fields.

                        o ASNEEDED : Use quotation  marks  for  output  fields
                          when needed.

                     QuoteEscapeCharacter -> (string)
                        The single character used for escaping the quote char-
                        acter inside an already escaped value.

                     RecordDelimiter -> (string)
                        A single character used to separate individual records
                        in  the  output. Instead of the default value, you can
                        specify an arbitrary delimiter.

                     FieldDelimiter -> (string)
                        The value used to  separate  individual  fields  in  a
                        record. You can specify an arbitrary delimiter.

                     QuoteCharacter -> (string)
                        A  single  character  used for escaping when the field
                        delimiter is part of the value. For  example,  if  the
                        value  is  a,  b , Amazon S3 wraps this field value in
                        quotation marks, as follows: " a , b " .

                 JSON -> (structure)
                     Specifies JSON as request's output serialization format.

                     RecordDelimiter -> (string)
                        The value used to separate individual records  in  the
                        output.  If  no  value  is specified, Amazon S3 uses a
                        newline character ('n').

          OutputLocation -> (structure)
              Describes the location where the restore job's output is stored.

              S3 -> (structure)
                 Describes an S3 location that will receive the results of the
                 restore request.

                 BucketName -> (string)
                     The  name of the bucket where the restore results will be
                     placed.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix that is prepended to the restore  results  for
                     this request.

                 Encryption -> (structure)
                     Contains the type of server-side encryption used.

                     EncryptionType -> (string)
                        The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing
                        job results in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms
                        ).

                     KMSKeyId -> (string)
                        If  the  encryption  type  is  aws:kms , this optional
                        value specifies the ID  of  the  symmetric  encryption
                        customer  managed key to use for encryption of job re-
                        sults. Amazon S3 only  supports  symmetric  encryption
                        KMS keys. For more information, see Asymmetric keys in
                        KMS in the Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service
                        Developer Guide .

                     KMSContext -> (string)
                        If  the  encryption  type  is  aws:kms , this optional
                        value can be used to specify  the  encryption  context
                        for the restore results.

                 CannedACL -> (string)
                     The canned ACL to apply to the restore results.

                 AccessControlList -> (list)
                     A  list  of  grants that control access to the staged re-

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has  Requester
          Pays  enabled,  the  requester will pay for corresponding charges to
          copy the object. For information about downloading objects from  Re-
          quester  Pays  buckets,  see  Downloading  Objects in Requester Pays
          Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for  the  object
          when  you  use  the SDK. This header will not provide any additional
          functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send  this  header,
          there must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header
          sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with  the  HTTP  status
          code 400 Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object in-
          tegrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3  ignores  any  pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a restore request for an object

       The following restore-object example restores the specified  Amazon  S3
       Glacier object for the bucket my-glacier-bucket for 10 days.

          aws s3api restore-object \
              --bucket my-glacier-bucket \
              --key doc1.rtf \
              --restore-request Days=10

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       RestoreOutputPath -> (string)
          Indicates the path in the provided S3 output location  where  Select
          results will be restored to.
