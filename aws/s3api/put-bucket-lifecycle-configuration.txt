NAME
       put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an ex-
       isting lifecycle configuration. Keep in mind that this  will  overwrite
       an  existing lifecycle configuration, so if you want to retain any con-
       figuration details, they must be included in the new lifecycle configu-
       ration.  For  information  about  lifecycle configuration, see Managing
       your storage lifecycle .
          Rules Permissions HTTP Host header syntax

       You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The life-
       cycle  configuration  is  specified  as  XML  consisting of one or more
       rules. An Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration can have up to 1,000 rules.
       This limit is not adjustable.

       Bucket lifecycle configuration supports specifying a lifecycle rule us-
       ing an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, object size, or
       any  combination of these. Accordingly, this section describes the lat-
       est API. The previous version of the API supported filtering based only
       on  an object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compati-
       bility for general purpose buckets. For the  related  API  description,
       see PutBucketLifecycle .

       NOTE:
          Lifecyle  configurations for directory buckets only support expiring
          objects and cancelling multipart uploads. Expiring of versioned  ob-
          jects,transitions and tag filters are not supported.

       A lifecycle rule consists of the following:

       o A  filter  identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies.
         The filter can be based on a key name  prefix,  object  tags,  object
         size, or any combination of these.

       o A status indicating whether the rule is in effect.

       o One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you want
         Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter. If  the
         state  of  your bucket is versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended,
         you can have many versions of the same object  (one  current  version
         and  zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined
         actions that you can specify for current and noncurrent  object  ver-
         sions.

       For  more  information,  see  Object Lifecycle Management and Lifecycle
       Configuration Elements .

       o General purpose bucket permissions - By default, all  Amazon  S3  re-
         sources  are  private, including buckets, objects, and related subre-
         sources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website  configura-
         tion).  Only the resource owner (that is, the Amazon Web Services ac-
         count that created it) can access the resource.  The  resource  owner
         can  optionally  grant access permissions to others by writing an ac-
         cess policy. For this operation, a user must have  the  s3:PutLifecy-
         cleConfiguration  permission.  You  can  also explicitly deny permis-
         sions. An explicit deny also supersedes any other permissions. If you
         want  to  block  users  or accounts from removing or deleting objects
         from your bucket, you must deny them permissions  for  the  following
         actions:

         o s3:DeleteObject

         o s3:DeleteObjectVersion

         o s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration    For  more information about permis-
           sions, see Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3  Resources
           .

       o Directory bucket permissions - You must have the s3express:PutLifecy-
         cleConfiguration permission in an IAM identity-based  policy  to  use
         this operation. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't sup-
         ported. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to
         others by creating a role or user for them as long as they are within
         the same account as the owner  and  resource.  For  more  information
         about  directory bucket policies and permissions, see Authorizing Re-
         gional endpoint APIs with IAM in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
              Directory buckets - For directory buckets,  you  must  make  re-
              quests  for  this  API operation to the Regional endpoint. These
              endpoints support path-style requests in the format
              ``
              https://s3express-control.*region_code*                 .amazon-
              aws.com/bucket-name  ``  .  Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't
              supported. For more information, see  Regional  and  Zonal  end-
              points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to set the configuration.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates  the  algorithm used to create the checksum for the object
          when you use the SDK. This header will not  provide  any  additional
          functionality  if  you don't use the SDK. When you send this header,
          there must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header
          sent.  Otherwise,  Amazon  S3 fails the request with the HTTP status
          code 400 Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object in-
          tegrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If  you  provide  an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --lifecycle-configuration (structure)
          Container for lifecycle rules. You can add as many as 1,000 rules.

          Rules -> (list)
              A lifecycle rule for individual objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              (structure)
                 A lifecycle rule for  individual  objects  in  an  Amazon  S3
                 bucket.

                 For  more information see, Managing your storage lifecycle in
                 the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 Expiration -> (structure)
                     Specifies the expiration for the lifecycle of the  object
                     in  the  form of date, days and, whether the object has a
                     delete marker.

                     Date -> (timestamp)
                        Indicates at what date the object is to  be  moved  or
                        deleted.  The  date value must conform to the ISO 8601
                        format. The time is always midnight UTC.

                        NOTE:
                            This parameter applies to general purpose  buckets
                            only.  It  is  not  supported for directory bucket
                            lifecycle configurations.

                     Days -> (integer)
                        Indicates the lifetime, in days, of the  objects  that
                        are  subject to the rule. The value must be a non-zero
                        positive integer.

                     ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether  Amazon  S3  will  remove  a  delete
                        marker  with  no  noncurrent versions. If set to true,
                        the delete marker will be expired; if set to false the
                        policy  takes no action. This cannot be specified with
                        Days or Date in a Lifecycle Expiration Policy.

                        NOTE:
                            This parameter applies to general purpose  buckets
                            only.  It  is  not  supported for directory bucket
                            lifecycle configurations.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Unique identifier for  the  rule.  The  value  cannot  be
                     longer than 255 characters.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     Prefix  identifying one or more objects to which the rule
                     applies. This is no longer used; use Filter instead.

                     WARNING:
                        Replacement must be made for  object  keys  containing
                        special characters (such as carriage returns) when us-
                        ing XML requests. For more information,  see  XML  re-
                        lated object key constraints .

                 Filter -> (structure)
                     The  Filter  is used to identify objects that a Lifecycle
                     Rule applies to. A Filter must have exactly one of Prefix
                     , Tag , or And specified. Filter is required if the Life-
                     cycleRule does not contain a Prefix element.

                     NOTE:
                        Tag filters are not supported for directory buckets.

                     Prefix -> (string)
                        Prefix identifying one or more objects  to  which  the
                        rule applies.

                        WARNING:
                            Replacement  must be made for object keys contain-
                            ing special characters (such as carriage  returns)
                            when using XML requests. For more information, see
                            XML related object key constraints .

                     Tag -> (structure)
                        This tag must exist in the object's tag set  in  order
                        for the rule to apply.

                        NOTE:
                            This  parameter applies to general purpose buckets
                            only. It is not  supported  for  directory  bucket
                            lifecycle configurations.

                        Key -> (string)
                            Name of the object key.

                        Value -> (string)
                            Value of the tag.

                     ObjectSizeGreaterThan -> (long)
                        Minimum object size to which the rule applies.

                     ObjectSizeLessThan -> (long)
                        Maximum object size to which the rule applies.

                     And -> (structure)
                        This  is  used  in  a Lifecycle Rule Filter to apply a
                        logical AND to two or more predicates.  The  Lifecycle
                        Rule  will  apply  to  any  object matching all of the
                        predicates configured inside the And operator.

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            Prefix identifying one or more  objects  to  which
                            the rule applies.

                        Tags -> (list)
                            All  of  these tags must exist in the object's tag
                            set in order for the rule to apply.

                            (structure)
                               A container of a key value name pair.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   Name of the object key.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   Value of the tag.

                        ObjectSizeGreaterThan -> (long)
                            Minimum object size to which the rule applies.

                        ObjectSizeLessThan -> (long)

                 Status -> (string)
                     If 'Enabled', the rule is  currently  being  applied.  If
                     'Disabled', the rule is not currently being applied.

                 Transitions -> (list)
                     Specifies when an Amazon S3 object transitions to a spec-
                     ified storage class.

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter  applies  to  general  purpose  buckets
                        only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecy-
                        cle configurations.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies when an object transitions  to  a  specified
                        storage  class.  For  more information about Amazon S3
                        lifecycle configuration rules, see  Transitioning  Ob-

                        Date -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates when objects  are  transitioned  to  the
                            specified storage class. The date value must be in
                            ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC.

                        Days -> (integer)
                            Indicates the number of days after  creation  when
                            objects  are transitioned to the specified storage
                            class. The value must be a positive integer.

                        StorageClass -> (string)
                            The storage class to which you want the object  to
                            transition.

                 NoncurrentVersionTransitions -> (list)
                     Specifies the transition rule for the lifecycle rule that
                     describes when noncurrent objects transition  to  a  spe-
                     cific storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled
                     (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action  to
                     request  that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object ver-
                     sions to a specific storage class at a set period in  the
                     object's lifetime.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter  applies  to  general  purpose buckets
                        only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecy-
                        cle configurations.

                     (structure)
                        Container  for the transition rule that describes when
                        noncurrent objects transition  to  the  STANDARD_IA  ,
                        ONEZONE_IA   ,   INTELLIGENT_TIERING  ,  GLACIER_IR  ,
                        GLACIER ,  or  DEEP_ARCHIVE  storage  class.  If  your
                        bucket  is  versioning-enabled  (or versioning is sus-
                        pended), you can set this action to request that  Ama-
                        zon  S3  transition  noncurrent object versions to the
                        STANDARD_IA  ,  ONEZONE_IA  ,  INTELLIGENT_TIERING   ,
                        GLACIER_IR  ,  GLACIER , or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class
                        at a specific period in the object's lifetime.

                        NoncurrentDays -> (integer)
                            Specifies the number of days an object is  noncur-
                            rent  before  Amazon S3 can perform the associated
                            action. For information about the noncurrent  days

                        StorageClass -> (string)
                            The class of storage used to store the object.

                        NewerNoncurrentVersions -> (integer)
                            Specifies  how  many noncurrent versions Amazon S3
                            will retain in the same storage class before tran-
                            sitioning  objects. You can specify up to 100 non-
                            current versions to retain. Amazon S3 will transi-
                            tion any additional noncurrent versions beyond the
                            specified number to retain. For  more  information

                            ration elements in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 NoncurrentVersionExpiration -> (structure)
                     Specifies when noncurrent object  versions  expire.  Upon
                     expiration,  Amazon S3 permanently deletes the noncurrent
                     object versions. You set this lifecycle configuration ac-
                     tion  on  a  bucket  that has versioning enabled (or sus-
                     pended) to request that Amazon S3 delete  noncurrent  ob-
                     ject  versions at a specific period in the object's life-
                     time.

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter  applies  to  general  purpose  buckets
                        only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecy-
                        cle configurations.

                     NoncurrentDays -> (integer)
                        Specifies the number of days an object  is  noncurrent
                        before  Amazon  S3  can perform the associated action.
                        The value must be a non-zero positive integer. For in-
                        formation  about the noncurrent days calculations, see
                        How Amazon S3 Calculates When an Object Became Noncur-

                            only. It is not  supported  for  directory  bucket
                            lifecycle configurations.

                     NewerNoncurrentVersions -> (integer)
                        Specifies  how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will
                        retain. You can specify up to 100 noncurrent  versions
                        to retain. Amazon S3 will permanently delete any addi-
                        tional noncurrent versions beyond the specified number
                        to  retain. For more information about noncurrent ver-
                        sions, see Lifecycle  configuration  elements  in  the
                        Amazon S3 User Guide .

                            lifecycle configurations.

                 AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the days since the initiation of an incomplete
                     multipart upload that Amazon S3 will wait  before  perma-
                     nently  removing all parts of the upload. For more infor-
                     mation, see Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a

                     Guide .

                     DaysAfterInitiation -> (integer)
                        Specifies the number of days  after  which  Amazon  S3
                        aborts an incomplete multipart upload.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

          NOTE:
              This  parameter  applies  to general purpose buckets only. It is
              not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

       --transition-default-minimum-object-size (string)
          Indicates which default minimum object size behavior is  applied  to
          the lifecycle configuration.

          NOTE:
              This  parameter  applies  to general purpose buckets only. It is
              not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

          o all_storage_classes_128K - Objects smaller than 128  KB  will  not
            transition to any storage class by default.

          o varies_by_storage_class - Objects smaller than 128 KB will transi-
            tion to Glacier Flexible Retrieval or Glacier Deep Archive storage
            classes.  By default, all other storage classes will prevent tran-
            sitions smaller than 128 KB.

          To customize the minimum object size for any transition you can  add
          a  filter  that  specifies a custom ObjectSizeGreaterThan or Object-
          SizeLessThan in the body of your transition rule. Custom filters al-
          ways take precedence over the default transition behavior.

          Possible values:

          o varies_by_storage_class

          o all_storage_classes_128K

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command applies a lifecycle  configuration  to  a  bucket
       named my-bucket:

          aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket my-bucket --lifecycle-configuration  file://lifecycle.json

       The  file  lifecycle.json is a JSON document in the current folder that
       specifies two rules:

          {
              "Rules": [
                  {
                      "ID": "Move rotated logs to Glacier",
                      "Prefix": "rotated/",
                      "Status": "Enabled",
                      "Transitions": [
                          {
                              "Date": "2015-11-10T00:00:00.000Z",
                              "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
                          }
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "Status": "Enabled",
                      "Prefix": "",
                      "NoncurrentVersionTransitions": [
                          {
                              "NoncurrentDays": 2,
                              "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
                          }
                      ],
                      "ID": "Move old versions to Glacier"
                  }
              ]
          }

       The first rule moves files with the prefix rotated to  Glacier  on  the
       specified  date.  The  second rule moves old object versions to Glacier
       when they are no longer current. For information  on  acceptable  time-
       stamp  formats,  see  Specifying  Parameter  Values in the AWS CLI User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       TransitionDefaultMinimumObjectSize -> (string)
          Indicates which default minimum object size behavior is  applied  to
          the lifecycle configuration.

          NOTE:
              This  parameter  applies  to general purpose buckets only. It is
              not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

          o all_storage_classes_128K - Objects smaller than 128  KB  will  not
            transition to any storage class by default.

          o varies_by_storage_class - Objects smaller than 128 KB will transi-
            tion to Glacier Flexible Retrieval or Glacier Deep Archive storage
            classes.  By default, all other storage classes will prevent tran-
            sitions smaller than 128 KB.

          To customize the minimum object size for any transition you can  add
          a  filter  that  specifies a custom ObjectSizeGreaterThan or Object-
          SizeLessThan in the body of your transition rule. Custom filters al-
          ways take precedence over the default transition behavior.
