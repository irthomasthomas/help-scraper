GET-BUCKET-CORS()                                            GET-BUCKET-CORS()



NAME
       get-bucket-cors -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration informa-
       tion set for the bucket.

       To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the  s3:Get-
       BucketCORS action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and
       can grant it to others.

       For more information about CORS,  see  Enabling  Cross-Origin  Resource
       Sharing .

       The following operations are related to GetBucketCors :

       o PutBucketCors

       o DeleteBucketCors

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-cors
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name for which to get the cors configuration.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status  code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The  following command retrieves the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing con-
       figuration for a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-cors --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

OUTPUT
       CORSRules -> (list)
          A set of origins and methods (cross-origin access that you  want  to
          allow). You can add up to 100 rules to the configuration.

          (structure)
              Specifies a cross-origin access rule for an Amazon S3 bucket.

              ID -> (string)
                 Unique  identifier  for  the rule. The value cannot be longer
                 than 255 characters.

              AllowedHeaders -> (list)
                 Headers  that  are  specified   in   the   Access-Control-Re-
                 quest-Headers  header.  These  headers  are allowed in a pre-
                 flight OPTIONS request. In response to any preflight  OPTIONS
                 request, Amazon S3 returns any requested headers that are al-
                 lowed.

                 (string)

              AllowedMethods -> (list)
                 An HTTP method that you allow the origin  to  execute.  Valid
                 values are GET , PUT , HEAD , POST , and DELETE .

                 (string)

              AllowedOrigins -> (list)
                 One  or  more origins you want customers to be able to access
                 the bucket from.

                 (string)

              ExposeHeaders -> (list)
                 One or more headers in the response that you  want  customers
                 to  be  able  to access from their applications (for example,
                 from a JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object).

                 (string)

              MaxAgeSeconds -> (integer)
                 The time in seconds that your browser is to  cache  the  pre-
                 flight response for the specified resource.
