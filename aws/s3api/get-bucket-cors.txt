GET-BUCKET-CORS()                                            GET-BUCKET-CORS()



NAME
       get-bucket-cors -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Returns the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration informa-
       tion set for the bucket.

       To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the  s3:Get-
       BucketCORS action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and
       can grant it to others.

       When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias
       of the access point in place of the bucket name.

       When  you  use  this  API operation with an Object Lambda access point,
       provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point  in  place  of  the
       bucket  name.  If  the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is
       not valid, the error code InvalidAccessPointAliasError is returned. For
       more information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError , see List of Error
       Codes .

       For more information about CORS,  see  Enabling  Cross-Origin  Resource
       Sharing .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name for which to get the cors configuration.

          When  you  use  this API operation with an access point, provide the
          alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.

          When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access  point,
          provide  the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the
          bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is
          not  valid, the error code InvalidAccessPointAliasError is returned.
          For more information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError ,  see  List
          of Error Codes .

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command retrieves the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing  con-
       figuration for a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-cors --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

OUTPUT
       CORSRules -> (list)
          A  set  of origins and methods (cross-origin access that you want to
          allow). You can add up to 100 rules to the configuration.

          (structure)
              Specifies a cross-origin access rule for an Amazon S3 bucket.

              ID -> (string)
                 Unique identifier for the rule. The value  cannot  be  longer

                 Headers   that   are   specified  in  the  Access-Control-Re-

                 flight  OPTIONS request. In response to any preflight OPTIONS
                 request, Amazon S3 returns any requested headers that are al-
                 lowed.

                 (string)

              AllowedMethods -> (list)

                 the bucket from.

                 (string)

              ExposeHeaders -> (list)
                 One  or  more headers in the response that you want customers
                 to be able to access from their  applications  (for  example,
                 from a JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object).

                 (string)

              MaxAgeSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  time  in  seconds that your browser is to cache the pre-
                 flight response for the specified resource.
