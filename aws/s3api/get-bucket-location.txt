GET-BUCKET-LOCATION()                                    GET-BUCKET-LOCATION()



NAME
       get-bucket-location -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  Region the bucket resides in. You set the bucket's Region
       using the LocationConstraint request parameter in  a  CreateBucket  re-
       quest. For more information, see CreateBucket .

       To  use  this  implementation  of the operation, you must be the bucket
       owner.

       To use this API against an access point, provide the alias of  the  ac-
       cess point in place of the bucket name.

       The following operations are related to GetBucketLocation :

       o GetObject

       o CreateBucket

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-location
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to get the location.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status  code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command retrieves the location constraint  for  a  bucket
       named my-bucket, if a constraint exists:

          aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "LocationConstraint": "us-west-2"
          }

OUTPUT
       LocationConstraint -> (string)
          Specifies the Region where the bucket resides. For a list of all the
          Amazon S3 supported location constraints by Region, see Regions  and
          Endpoints . Buckets in Region us-east-1 have a LocationConstraint of
          null .
