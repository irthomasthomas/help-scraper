GET-BUCKET-LOCATION()                                    GET-BUCKET-LOCATION()



NAME
       get-bucket-location -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Returns  the  Region the bucket resides in. You set the bucket's Region
       using the LocationConstraint request parameter in  a  CreateBucket  re-
       quest. For more information, see CreateBucket .

       When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias
       of the access point in place of the bucket name.

       When you use this API operation with an  Object  Lambda  access  point,
       provide  the  alias  of  the Object Lambda access point in place of the
       bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in  a  request  is
       not valid, the error code InvalidAccessPointAliasError is returned. For
       more information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError , see List of Error
       Codes .

       NOTE:
          We  recommend  that  you  use HeadBucket to return the Region that a
          bucket resides in. For backward compatibility, Amazon  S3  continues
          to support GetBucketLocation.

       The following operations are related to GetBucketLocation :

       o GetObject

       o CreateBucket

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to get the location.

          When  you  use  this API operation with an access point, provide the
          alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.

          When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access  point,
          provide  the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the
          bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is
          not  valid, the error code InvalidAccessPointAliasError is returned.
          For more information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError ,  see  List
          of Error Codes .

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command retrieves the location constraint  for  a  bucket
       named my-bucket, if a constraint exists:

          aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "LocationConstraint": "us-west-2"
          }

OUTPUT
       LocationConstraint -> (string)
          Specifies the Region where the bucket resides. For a list of all the
          Amazon S3 supported location constraints by Region, see Regions  and
          Endpoints . Buckets in Region us-east-1 have a LocationConstraint of
          null .
