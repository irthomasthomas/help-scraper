GET-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTES()                                GET-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       get-object-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  all the metadata from an object without returning the object
       itself. This action is useful if you're interested only in an  object's
       metadata. To use GetObjectAttributes , you must have READ access to the
       object.
          GetObjectAttributes combines the  functionality  of  HeadObject  and
          ListParts  .  All of the data returned with each of those individual
          calls can be returned with a single call to GetObjectAttributes .

       If you encrypt an object by  using  server-side  encryption  with  cus-
       tomer-provided  encryption  keys  (SSE-C)  when you store the object in
       Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata  from  the  object,  you
       must use the following headers:

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

       For  more  information  about  SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using
       Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:

          o Encryption request headers, such as x-amz-server-side-encryption ,
            should   not  be  sent  for  GET  requests  if  your  object  uses
            server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys stored in
            Amazon   Web   Services   Key   Management  Service  (SSE-KMS)  or
            server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed  keys  (SSE-S3).  If
            your  object  does use these types of keys, you'll get an HTTP 400
            Bad Request error.

          o The last modified property in this case is the  creation  date  of
            the object.

       Consider the following when using request headers:

       o If  both  of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present
         in the request as follows, then Amazon S3  returns  the  HTTP  status
         code 200 OK and the data requested:

         o If-Match condition evaluates to true .

         o If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false .

       o If  both  of  the  If-None-Match  and  If-Modified-Since  headers are
         present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3  returns  the  HTTP
         status code 304 Not Modified :

         o If-None-Match condition evaluates to false .

         o If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true .

       For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .
          Permissions

       The  permissions  that you need to use this operation depend on whether
       the bucket is versioned. If the bucket is versioned, you need both  the
       s3:GetObjectVersion  and  s3:GetObjectVersionAttributes permissions for
       this operation. If the bucket is not versioned, you need the  s3:GetOb-
       ject  and s3:GetObjectAttributes permissions. For more information, see
       Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide . If the
       object that you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns de-
       pends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.

       o If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 re-
         turns an HTTP status code 404 Not Found ("no such key") error.

       o If  you don't have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an
         HTTP status code 403 Forbidden ("access denied") error.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket that contains the object.

          When using this action with an access point,  you  must  direct  re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .ama-
          zonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in  place
          of  the  bucket  name. For more information about access point ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the form `` AccessPointName -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com``  . When you use this action with S3
          on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs,  you  provide  the
          Outposts  access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more in-
          formation about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts?  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --key (string)
          The object key.

       --version-id (string)
          The version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --max-parts (integer)
          Sets the maximum number of parts to return.

       --part-number-marker (integer)
          Specifies the part after which listing should begin. Only parts with
          higher part numbers will be listed.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for exam-
          ple, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies  the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use
          in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and  then
          it  is  discarded;  Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The
          key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in  the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies  the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
          RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message  integrity  check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their  re-
          quests. If either the source or destination Amazon S3 bucket has Re-
          quester Pays enabled,  the  requester  will  pay  for  corresponding
          charges  to  copy  the object. For information about downloading ob-
          jects from Requester Pays buckets, see Downloading  Objects  in  Re-
          quester Pays Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status  code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --object-attributes (list)
          Specifies the fields at the root level that you want returned in the
          response. Fields that you do not specify are not returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            ETag
            Checksum
            ObjectParts
            StorageClass
            ObjectSize

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                     This will only be present if it was uploaded with the ob-
                     ject. With multipart uploads, this may not be a  checksum
                     value  of  the  object.  For  more  information about how
                     checksums are  calculated  with  multipart  uploads,  see

                 ChecksumSHA256 -> (string)
                     The base64-encoded, 256-bit SHA-256 digest of the object.
                     This will only be present if it was uploaded with the ob-
                     ject.  With multipart uploads, this may not be a checksum
                     value of the  object.  For  more  information  about  how
                     checksums  are  calculated  with  multipart  uploads, see
                     Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       StorageClass -> (string)
          Provides the storage class information of the object. Amazon S3  re-
          turns  this  header  for  all objects except for S3 Standard storage
          class objects.

          For more information, see Storage Classes .

       ObjectSize -> (long)
          The size of the object in bytes.
