PUT-BUCKET-POLICY()                                        PUT-BUCKET-POLICY()



NAME
       put-bucket-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  an  Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you are
       using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon  Web  Services
       account  that  owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the Put-
       BucketPolicy permissions on the specified  bucket  and  belong  to  the
       bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.

       If  you don't have PutBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a 403
       Access Denied error. If you have the correct  permissions,  but  you're
       not  using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Ama-
       zon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

       WARNING:
          To ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out
          of  their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's Amazon
          Web Services account can perform the GetBucketPolicy , PutBucketPol-
          icy  , and DeleteBucketPolicy API actions, even if their bucket pol-
          icy explicitly denies the root principal's access. Bucket owner root
          principals  can only be blocked from performing these API actions by
          VPC endpoint policies and Amazon Web  Services  Organizations  poli-
          cies.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash of the request body.

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates  the  algorithm used to create the checksum for the object
          when using the SDK. This header  will  not  provide  any  additional
          functionality  if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there
          must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header sent.
          Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code 400
          Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object integrity in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If  you  provide  an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --confirm-remove-self-bucket-access         |          --no-confirm-re-
       move-self-bucket-access (boolean)
          Set  this  parameter to true to confirm that you want to remove your
          permissions to change this bucket policy in the future.

       --policy (string)
          The bucket policy as a JSON document.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       This example allows all users to retrieve any object in MyBucket except
       those  in  the MySecretFolder. It also grants put and delete permission
       to the root user of the AWS account 1234-5678-9012:

          aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket MyBucket --policy file://policy.json

          policy.json:
          {
             "Statement": [
                {
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Principal": "*",
                   "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                   "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/*"
                },
                {
                   "Effect": "Deny",
                   "Principal": "*",
                   "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                   "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/MySecretFolder/*"
                },
                {
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Principal": {
                      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
                   },
                   "Action": [
                      "s3:DeleteObject",
                      "s3:PutObject"
                   ],
                   "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/*"
                }
             ]
          }
