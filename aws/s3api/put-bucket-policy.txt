NAME
       put-bucket-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket.

       NOTE:
              Directory  buckets  -  For  directory buckets, you must make re-
              quests for this API operation to the  Regional  endpoint.  These
              endpoints support path-style requests in the format
              ``
              https://s3express-control.*region_code*                 .amazon-
              aws.com/bucket-name `` .  Virtual-hosted-style  requests  aren't
              supported.  For  more  information,  see Regional and Zonal end-
              points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 26)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          Permissions

       If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web
       Services  account  that owns the bucket, the calling identity must both
       have the PutBucketPolicy permissions on the specified bucket and belong
       to the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.

       If  you don't have PutBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a 403
       Access Denied error. If you have the correct  permissions,  but  you're
       not  using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Ama-
       zon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

       WARNING:
          To ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out
          of  their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's Amazon
          Web Services account can perform the GetBucketPolicy , PutBucketPol-
          icy  , and DeleteBucketPolicy API actions, even if their bucket pol-
          icy explicitly denies the root principal's access. Bucket owner root
          principals  can only be blocked from performing these API actions by
          VPC endpoint policies and Amazon Web  Services  Organizations  poli-
          cies.

       o General  purpose  bucket permissions - The s3:PutBucketPolicy permis-
         sion is required in a policy. For more information about general pur-
         pose  buckets  bucket  policies,  see  Using Bucket Policies and User
         Policies in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       o Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation,
         you  must  have  the  s3express:PutBucketPolicy  permission in an IAM
         identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy.  Cross-account  ac-
         cess  to  this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only
         be performed by the Amazon Web Services account  that  owns  the  re-
         source. For more information about directory bucket policies and per-
         missions, see Amazon Web  Services  Identity  and  Access  Management
         (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket,   you   must  use  path-style  requests  in  the  format
              https://s3express-control.*region_code*                 .amazon-
              aws.com/*bucket-name*  `` . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't
              supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in  the  chosen
              Availability  Zone.  Bucket names must also follow the format ``
              *bucket_base_name* --*az_id* --x-s3 (for example,  ``  DOC-EXAM-
              PLE-BUCKET  --usw2-az1  --x-s3`` ). For information about bucket
              naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming  rules  in  the
              Amazon S3 User Guide

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash of the request body.

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates  the  algorithm used to create the checksum for the object
          when you use the SDK. This header will not  provide  any  additional
          functionality  if  you don't use the SDK. When you send this header,
          there must  be  a  corresponding  x-amz-checksum-*algorithm*  ``  or
          ``x-amz-trailer  header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request
          with the HTTP status code 400 Bad Request .

          For the
          ``
          x-amz-checksum-algorithm `` header, replace `` algorithm `` with the
          supported algorithm from the following list:

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 161)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

          For more information, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

          If the individual checksum value you  provide  through  x-amz-check-
          sum-*algorithm*  ``  doesn't  match  the  checksum algorithm you set
          through ``x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm , Amazon S3 ignores any  pro-
          vided  ChecksumAlgorithm  parameter  and uses the checksum algorithm
          that matches the provided value in
          ``
          x-amz-checksum-algorithm `` .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 181)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 NOTE:
              For directory buckets, when you use Amazon  Web  Services  SDKs,
              CRC32  is the default checksum algorithm that's used for perfor-
              mance.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --confirm-remove-self-bucket-access         |          --no-confirm-re-
       move-self-bucket-access (boolean)
          Set  this  parameter to true to confirm that you want to remove your
          permissions to change this bucket policy in the future.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --policy (string)
          The bucket policy as a JSON document.

          For directory buckets, the only IAM action supported in  the  bucket
          policy is s3express:CreateSession .

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

          NOTE:
              For  directory buckets, this header is not supported in this API
              operation. If you specify this header, the  request  fails  with
              the HTTP status code 501 Not Implemented .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       This example allows all users to retrieve any object in MyBucket except
       those  in  the MySecretFolder. It also grants put and delete permission
       to the root user of the AWS account 1234-5678-9012:

          aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket MyBucket --policy file://policy.json

          policy.json:
          {
             "Statement": [
                {
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Principal": "*",
                   "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                   "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/*"
                },
                {
                   "Effect": "Deny",
                   "Principal": "*",
                   "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                   "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/MySecretFolder/*"
                },
                {
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Principal": {
                      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
                   },
                   "Action": [
                      "s3:DeleteObject",
                      "s3:PutObject"
                   ],
                   "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/*"
                }
             ]
          }
