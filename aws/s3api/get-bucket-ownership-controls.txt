OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose OwnershipControls you want to
          retrieve.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the bucket ownership settings of a bucket

       The   following  get-bucket-ownership-controls  example  retrieves  the
       bucket ownership settings of a bucket.

          aws s3api get-bucket-ownership-controls \
              --bucket DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET

       Output:

          {
              "OwnershipControls": {
                  "Rules": [
                      {
                          "ObjectOwnership": "BucketOwnerEnforced"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

       For more information, see Viewing the Object Ownership setting  for  an
       S3 bucket in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

OUTPUT
       OwnershipControls -> (structure)
          The OwnershipControls (BucketOwnerEnforced, BucketOwnerPreferred, or
          ObjectWriter) currently in effect for this Amazon S3 bucket.

          Rules -> (list)
              The container element for an ownership control rule.

              (structure)
                 The container element for an ownership control rule.

                 ObjectOwnership -> (string)
                     The container element for object ownership for a bucket's
                     ownership controls.
                        BucketOwnerPreferred  - Objects uploaded to the bucket
                        change ownership to the bucket owner  if  the  objects
                        are uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-control canned
                        ACL.

                        ObjectWriter - The uploading account will own the  ob-
                        ject    if   the   object   is   uploaded   with   the
                        bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL.

                        BucketOwnerEnforced - Access control lists (ACLs)  are
                        disabled  and no longer affect permissions. The bucket
                        owner automatically owns and has full control over ev-
                        ery  object in the bucket. The bucket only accepts PUT
                        requests that don't specify an ACL or  specify  bucket
                        owner  full  control  ACLs  (such  as  the  predefined
                        bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL or a  custom  ACL
                        in XML format that grants the same permissions).

                     By default, ObjectOwnership is set to BucketOwnerEnforced
                     and ACLs are disabled. We  recommend  keeping  ACLs  dis-
                     abled,  except  in uncommon use cases where you must con-
                     trol access for each object individually. For more infor-
                     mation  about S3 Object Ownership, see Controlling owner-
                     ship of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket in the
                     Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     NOTE:
                        This  functionality  is  not  supported  for directory
                        buckets. Directory buckets use the  bucket  owner  en-
                        forced setting for S3 Object Ownership.
