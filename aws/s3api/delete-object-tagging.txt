OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  bucket  name  containing  the  objects from which to remove the
          tags.
              Access points - When you use this action with an  access  point,
              you  must  provide the alias of the access point in place of the
              bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the  ac-
              cess  point  ARN,  you  must direct requests to the access point
              hostname. The access point hostname takes the form  AccessPoint-
              Name  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com. When
              using this action with an access point through  the  Amazon  Web
              Services  SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the
              bucket name. For more information about access point  ARNs,  see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts  hostname.
              The  S3  on  Outposts hostname takes the form `` AccessPointName
              -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` .
              When  you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon
              Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN  in
              place  of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Out-
              posts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the  Amazon  S3  User
              Guide .

       --key (string)
          The  key  that identifies the object in the bucket from which to re-
          move all tags.

       --version-id (string)
          The versionId of the object that the tag-set will be removed from.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          aws s3api delete-object-tagging \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key doc1.rtf

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       VersionId -> (string)
          The versionId of the object the tag-set was removed from.
