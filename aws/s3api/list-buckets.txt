OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command uses the  list-buckets  command  to  display  the
       names of all your Amazon S3 buckets (across all regions):

          aws s3api list-buckets --query "Buckets[].Name"

       The  query  option  filters the output of list-buckets down to only the
       bucket names.

       For more information about buckets, see Working with Amazon S3  Buckets
       in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Buckets -> (list)
          The list of buckets owned by the requester.

          (structure)
              In terms of implementation, a Bucket is a resource. An Amazon S3
              bucket name is globally unique, and the namespace is  shared  by
              all Amazon Web Services accounts.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 Date the bucket was created. This date can change when making
                 changes to your bucket, such as editing its bucket policy.

       Owner -> (structure)
          The owner of the buckets listed.

          DisplayName -> (string)
              Container for the display name of the owner. This value is  only
              supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:

              o US East (N. Virginia)

              o US West (N. California)

              o US West (Oregon)

              o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

              o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

              o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

              o Europe (Ireland)

              o South America (So Paulo)

          ID -> (string)
              Container for the ID of the owner.
