PUT-BUCKET-NOTIFICATION-CONFIGURATION()PUT-BUCKET-NOTIFICATION-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-notification-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

       Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more infor-
       mation about event notifications, see Configuring Event Notifications .

       Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration.
       The  configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you
       want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon  S3
       to publish an event notification when it detects an event of the speci-
       fied type.

       By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is,
       the  notification configuration will be an empty NotificationConfigura-
       tion .
          <NotificationConfiguration>

          </NotificationConfiguration>

       This action replaces the existing notification configuration  with  the
       configuration you include in the request body.

       After  Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Ama-
       zon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)  or  Amazon  Simple  Queue
       Service  (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and that the bucket owner has
       permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the case
       of  Lambda  destinations,  Amazon  S3 verifies that the Lambda function
       permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from  the
       Amazon  S3  bucket. For more information, see Configuring Notifications
       for Amazon S3 Events .

       You can disable notifications by adding the empty  NotificationConfigu-
       ration element.

       For  more information about the number of event notification configura-
       tions that you can create per bucket, see Amazon S3 service  quotas  in
       Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       By  default,  only  the  bucket  owner can configure notifications on a
       bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permis-
       sion to other users to set this configuration with the required s3:Put-
       BucketNotification permission.

       NOTE:
          The PUT notification is an atomic operation.  For  example,  suppose
          your  notification  configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and
          Lambda function configurations. When you send  a  PUT  request  with
          this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS topic.
          If the message fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3
          will not add the configuration to your bucket.

       If the configuration in the request body includes only one TopicConfig-
       uration specifying only the s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject event  type,
       the  response  will  also  include the x-amz-sns-test-message-id header
       containing the message ID of the test notification sent to the topic.

                     tion about key name filtering, see Configuring event  no-
                     tifications using object key name filtering in the Amazon
                     S3 User Guide .

                            (structure)
                               Specifies the Amazon S3 object key name to fil-
                               ter on. An object key name is the name assigned
                               to an object in  your  Amazon  S3  bucket.  You
                               specify whether to filter on the suffix or pre-
                               fix of the object key name. A prefix is a  spe-
                               cific  string of characters at the beginning of
                               an object key name, which you can use to  orga-
                               nize  objects.  For  example, you can start the
                               key names of related  objects  with  a  prefix,
                               such  as  2023- or engineering/ . Then, you can
                               use FilterRule to find objects in a bucket with
                               key  names  that have the same prefix. A suffix
                               is similar to a prefix, but it is at the end of
                               the  object  key  name instead of at the begin-
                               ning.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --skip-destination-validation | --no-skip-destination-validation (bool-
       ean)
          Skips validation of Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, and Lambda destinations.
          True or false value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To enable the specified notifications to a bucket

       The following put-bucket-notification-configuration example  applies  a
       notification  configuration to a bucket named my-bucket. The file noti-
       fication.json is a JSON document in the current folder  that  specifies
       an SNS topic and an event type to monitor.

          aws s3api put-bucket-notification-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --notification-configuration file://notification.json

       Contents of notification.json:

          {
              "TopicConfigurations": [
                  {
                      "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:s3-notification-topic",
                      "Events": [
                          "s3:ObjectCreated:*"
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

       The SNS topic must have an IAM policy attached to it that allows Amazon
       S3 to publish to it.

                          }
                      }
                  }
              ]
