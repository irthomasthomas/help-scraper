PUT-OBJECT-ACL()                                              PUT-OBJECT-ACL()



NAME
       put-object-acl -

DESCRIPTION
       Uses  the  acl subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permis-
       sions for a new or existing object in  an  S3  bucket.  You  must  have
       WRITE_ACP permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information,
       see What permissions can I grant? in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the  ACL  on
       an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if
       you have an existing application that updates a bucket  ACL  using  the
       request  body, you can continue to use that approach. For more informa-
       tion, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview  in  the  Amazon  S3  User
       Guide .

       WARNING:
          If  your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object
          Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect  permissions.  You
          must  use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in
          it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the  Access-
          ControlListNotSupported  error code. Requests to read ACLs are still
          supported. For more information, see Controlling object ownership in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Permissions

       You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

       o Specify  a  canned  ACL  with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3
         supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each  canned
         ACL  has  a  predefined  set of grantees and permissions. Specify the
         canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-ac l. If you use  this  header,
         you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request.
         For more information, see Canned ACL .

       o Specify access permissions explicitly  with  the  x-amz-grant-read  ,
         x-amz-grant-read-acp      ,      x-amz-grant-write-acp      ,     and
         x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you spec-
         ify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services ac-
         counts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission.  If  you
         use  these  ACL-specific  headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to
         set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that
         Amazon  S3  supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Con-
         trol List (ACL) Overview . You specify each grantee as  a  type=value
         pair, where the type is one of the following:

         o id   if  the  value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon
           Web Services account

         o uri  if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

         o emailAddress  if the value specified is the  email  address  of  an
           Amazon Web Services account

         NOTE:
                Using  email  addresses to specify a grantee is only supported
                in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:

                   o US East (N. Virginia)

                   o US West (N. California)

                   o US West (Oregon)

                   o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

                   o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                   o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                   o Europe (Ireland)

                   o South America (So Paulo)

            For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions  and  endpoints,
            see  Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Ref-
            erence.

       For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list  objects
       permission  to the two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their
       email addresses.
          x-amz-grant-read:      emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com",       emailAd-
          dress="abc@amazon.com"

       You  can  use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explic-
       itly. You cannot do both.
          Grantee Values

       You can specify the person (grantee) to whom  you're  assigning  access
       rights (using request elements) in the following ways:

       o By           the           person's           ID:            <Grantee
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesE-
         mail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>   DisplayName is optional and ignored
         in the request.

       o By   URI:   <Grantee  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-in-
         stance"                    xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazon-
         aws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>

       o By               Email               address:                <Grantee
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:type="Ama-
         zonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAd-
         dress>lt;/Grantee>   The grantee is  resolved  to  the  CanonicalUser
         and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the Canon-
         icalUser.

       NOTE:
              Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported  in
              the following Amazon Web Services Regions:

                 o US East (N. Virginia)

                 o US West (N. California)

                 o US West (Oregon)

                 o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

                 o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                 o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                 o Europe (Ireland)

                 o South America (So Paulo)

          For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see
          Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

          Versioning

       The ACL of an object is set at the object version  level.  By  default,
       PUT sets the ACL of the current version of an object. To set the ACL of
       a different version, use the versionId subresource.

       The following operations are related to PutObjectAcl :

       o CopyObject

       o GetObject

          }

       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name that contains the object to which you want to attach
          the ACL.

          When using this action with an access point,  you  must  direct  re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .ama-
          zonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in  place
          of  the  bucket  name. For more information about access point ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --content-md5 (string)
          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. This header  must
          be used as a message integrity check to verify that the request body
          was not corrupted in transit. For more information, go to RFC 1864.>

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for  the  object
          when  using  the  SDK.  This  header will not provide any additional
          functionality if not using the SDK. When sending this header,  there
          must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header sent.
          Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code 400
          Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object integrity in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3  ignores  any  pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --grant-full-control (string)
          Allows  grantee the read, write, read ACP, and write ACP permissions
          on the bucket.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read (string)
          Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to read the bucket ACL.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-write (string)
          Allows grantee to create new objects in the bucket.

          For the bucket and object owners of existing  objects,  also  allows
          deletions and overwrites of those objects.

       --grant-write-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable bucket.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --key (string)
          Key for which the PUT action was initiated.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form `` AccessPointName -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` . When you use this action  with  S3
          on  Outposts  through  the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the
          Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more  in-
          formation  about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. For information about  downloading  objects  from  Requester
          Pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command grants full control to two AWS users (user1@exam-
       ple.com and user2@example.com) and read permission to everyone:

          aws s3api put-object-acl --bucket MyBucket --key file.txt --grant-full-control emailaddress=user1@example.com,emailaddress=user2@example.com --grant-read uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers

       See
       http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTacl.html
       for  details  on  custom  ACLs (the s3api ACL commands, such as put-ob-
       ject-acl, use the same shorthand argument notation).

OUTPUT
       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.
