PUT-BUCKET-VERSIONING()                                PUT-BUCKET-VERSIONING()



NAME
       put-bucket-versioning -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

       NOTE:
          When  you enable versioning on a bucket for the first time, it might
          take a short amount of time for the change to be  fully  propagated.
          While  this  change  is  propagating, you may encounter intermittent
          HTTP 404 NoSuchKey errors for requests to objects created or updated
          after enabling versioning. We recommend that you wait for 15 minutes
          after enabling versioning before issuing write  operations  (PUT  or
          DELETE ) on objects in the bucket.

       Sets the versioning state of an existing bucket.

       You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:
          Enabled  Enables  versioning  for the objects in the bucket. All ob-
          jects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

          Suspended Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All ob-
          jects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

       If  the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no ver-
       sioning state; a GetBucketVersioning request does not return a version-
       ing state value.

       In order to enable MFA Delete, you must be the bucket owner. If you are
       the bucket owner and want to enable MFA Delete in the bucket versioning
       configuration,  you  must  include the x-amz-mfa request header and the
       Status and the MfaDelete request elements in a request to set the  ver-
       sioning state of the bucket.

       WARNING:
          If  you  have  an  object expiration lifecycle configuration in your
          non-versioned bucket and you want to  maintain  the  same  permanent
          delete  behavior  when you enable versioning, you must add a noncur-
          rent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle configu-
          ration  will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in
          the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains  one
          current  and  zero or more noncurrent object versions.) For more in-
          formation, see Lifecycle and Versioning .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.

       --content-md5 (string)
          >The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the  data.  You  must  use
          this  header as a message integrity check to verify that the request
          body was not corrupted in transit. For  more  information,  see  RFC
          1864 .

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates  the  algorithm used to create the checksum for the object
          when you use the SDK. This header will not  provide  any  additional
          functionality  if  you don't use the SDK. When you send this header,
          there must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header
          sent.  Otherwise,  Amazon  S3 fails the request with the HTTP status
          code 400 Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object in-
          tegrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If  you  provide  an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --mfa (string)
          The concatenation of the authentication device's  serial  number,  a
          space,  and  the  value that is displayed on your authentication de-
          vice.

       --versioning-configuration (structure)
          Container for setting the versioning state.

          MFADelete -> (string)
              Specifies whether MFA delete is enabled in the bucket versioning
              configuration.  This  element is only returned if the bucket has
              been configured with MFA delete. If the bucket has never been so
              configured, this element is not returned.

          Status -> (string)
              The versioning state of the bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MFADelete=string,Status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MFADelete": "Enabled"|"Disabled",
            "Status": "Enabled"|"Suspended"
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command enables versioning on a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

       The following command enables versioning, and uses an mfa code

          aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled --mfa "SERIAL 123456"

OUTPUT
       None
