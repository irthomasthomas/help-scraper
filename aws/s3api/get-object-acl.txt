GET-OBJECT-ACL()                                              GET-OBJECT-ACL()



NAME
       get-object-acl -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Returns  the access control list (ACL) of an object. To use this opera-
       tion, you must have s3:GetObjectAcl permissions or READ_ACP  access  to
       the  object.  For  more information, see Mapping of ACL permissions and
       access policy permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide

       This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       By default, GET returns ACL information about the current version of an
       object.  To  return  ACL information about a different version, use the
       versionId subresource.

       NOTE:
          If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3  Object
          Ownership,  requests to read ACLs are still supported and return the
          bucket-owner-full-control ACL with the owner being the account  that
          created  the  bucket.  For  more information, see Controlling object
          ownership and disabling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name that contains the object for which to  get  the  ACL
          information.
              Access  points  - When you use this action with an access point,
              you must provide the alias of the access point in place  of  the
              bucket  name or specify the access point ARN. When using the ac-
              cess point ARN, you must direct requests  to  the  access  point
              hostname.  The access point hostname takes the form AccessPoint-
              Name -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When
              using  this  action  with an access point through the Amazon Web
              Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of  the
              bucket  name.  For more information about access point ARNs, see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --key (string)
          The key of the object for which to get the ACL information.

       --version-id (string)
          Version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has  Requester
          Pays  enabled,  the  requester will pay for corresponding charges to
          copy the object. For information about downloading objects from  Re-
          quester  Pays  buckets,  see  Downloading  Objects in Requester Pays
          Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       in a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-object-acl --bucket my-bucket --key index.html
