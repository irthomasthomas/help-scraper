GET-OBJECT-ACL()                                              GET-OBJECT-ACL()



NAME
       get-object-acl -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the access control list (ACL) of an object. To use this opera-
       tion, you must have s3:GetObjectAcl permissions or READ_ACP  access  to
       the  object.  For  more information, see Mapping of ACL permissions and
       access policy permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide

       This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
          Versioning

       By default, GET returns ACL information about the current version of an
       object.  To  return  ACL information about a different version, use the
       versionId subresource.

       NOTE:
          If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3  Object
          Ownership,  requests to read ACLs are still supported and return the
          bucket-owner-full-control ACL with the owner being the account  that
          created  the  bucket.  For  more information, see Controlling object
          ownership and disabling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       The following operations are related to GetObjectAcl :

SYNOPSIS
            get-object-acl
          --bucket <value>
          --key <value>
          [--version-id <value>]
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name that contains the object for which to  get  the  ACL
          information.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --key (string)
          The key of the object for which to get the ACL information.

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their  re-
          quests.  For  information  about  downloading objects from Requester
          Pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requester Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status  code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command retrieves the access control list for  an  object
