GET-PUBLIC-ACCESS-BLOCK()                            GET-PUBLIC-ACCESS-BLOCK()



NAME
       get-public-access-block -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Retrieves  the PublicAccessBlock configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket.
       To use this operation, you must have the  s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock
       permission.  For  more  information  about  Amazon  S3 permissions, see
       Specifying Permissions in a Policy .

       WARNING:
          When Amazon S3 evaluates the PublicAccessBlock configuration  for  a
          bucket  or  an object, it checks the PublicAccessBlock configuration
          for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the
          bucket  owner's  account. If the PublicAccessBlock settings are dif-
          ferent between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses  the  most
          restrictive  combination  of the bucket-level and account-level set-
          tings.

       For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an  ob-
       ject public, see The Meaning of "Public" .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose PublicAccessBlock configura-
          tion you want to retrieve.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set or modify the block public access configuration for a bucket

       The following get-public-access-block example displays the block public
       access configuration for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api get-public-access-block \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "PublicAccessBlockConfiguration": {
                  "IgnorePublicAcls": true,
                  "BlockPublicPolicy": true,
                  "BlockPublicAcls": true,
                  "RestrictPublicBuckets": true
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       PublicAccessBlockConfiguration -> (structure)
          The PublicAccessBlock configuration currently  in  effect  for  this
          Amazon S3 bucket.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should block public access control
              lists (ACLs) for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting
              this element to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PUT  Bucket ACL and PUT Object ACL calls fail if the specified
                ACL is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs  for  this
              bucket  and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to TRUE
              causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on  this  bucket  and
              objects in this bucket.

              Enabling  this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any ex-
              isting ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket  policies
              for  this  bucket. Setting this element to TRUE causes Amazon S3
              to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy  if  the  specified  bucket
              policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket poli-
              cies for this bucket. Setting this element to TRUE restricts ac-
              cess  to  this bucket to only Amazon Web Servicesservice princi-
              pals and authorized users within this account if the bucket  has
              a public policy.

              Enabling  this  setting  doesn't affect previously stored bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public  bucket  policy,  including non-public delegation to spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.
