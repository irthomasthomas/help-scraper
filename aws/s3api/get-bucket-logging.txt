SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-logging
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name for which to get the logging information.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the logging status for a bucket

       The following get-bucket-logging example retrieves the  logging  status
       for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api get-bucket-logging \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "LoggingEnabled": {
                  "TargetPrefix": "",
                  "TargetBucket": "my-bucket-logs"
                    }
          }

OUTPUT
       LoggingEnabled -> (structure)
          Describes  where  logs  are stored and the prefix that Amazon S3 as-
          signs to all log object keys for a bucket. For more information, see
          PUT Bucket logging in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

          TargetBucket -> (string)
              Specifies  the  bucket  where you want Amazon S3 to store server
              access logs. You can have your logs delivered to any bucket that
              you own, including the same bucket that is being logged. You can
              also configure multiple buckets to deliver  their  logs  to  the
              same  target bucket. In this case, you should choose a different
              TargetPrefix for each source bucket so that  the  delivered  log
              files can be distinguished by key.

          TargetGrants -> (list)
              Container for granting information.

              Buckets  that  use  the bucket owner enforced setting for Object
              Ownership don't support target grants. For more information, see
              Permissions for server access log delivery in the Amazon S3 User
              Guide .

              (structure)
                 Container for granting information.

                 Buckets that use the bucket owner enforced setting for Object
                 Ownership  don't support target grants. For more information,
                 see Permissions server access log delivery in the  Amazon  S3
                 User Guide .

                 Grantee -> (structure)
                     Container for the person being granted permissions.

                     DisplayName -> (string)
                        Screen name of the grantee.

                     EmailAddress -> (string)
                        Email address of the grantee.

                        NOTE:
                            Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only
                            supported in the following Amazon Web Services Re-
                            gions:

                            o US East (N. Virginia)

                            o US West (N. California)

                            o US West (Oregon)

                            o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

                            o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                            o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                            For  a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions
                            and endpoints, see Regions and  Endpoints  in  the
                            Amazon Web Services General Reference.

                     ID -> (string)

                     Type -> (string)
                        Type of grantee

              A prefix for all log object keys. If you store  log  files  from
              multiple  Amazon  S3  buckets  in a single bucket, you can use a
              prefix to distinguish which log files came from which bucket.

              Amazon S3 key format for log objects.

              SimplePrefix -> (structure)
