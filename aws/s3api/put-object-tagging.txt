PUT-OBJECT-TAGGING()                                      PUT-OBJECT-TAGGING()



NAME
       put-object-tagging -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the supplied tag-set to an object that already exists in a bucket.
       A tag is a key-value pair. For more information, see Object Tagging .

       You can associate tags with an object by sending a PUT request  against
       the tagging subresource that is associated with the object. You can re-
       trieve tags by  sending  a  GET  request.  For  more  information,  see
       GetObjectTagging .

       For  tagging-related  restrictions related to characters and encodings,
       see Tag Restrictions . Note that Amazon S3 limits the maximum number of
       tags to 10 tags per object.

       To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:PutO-
       bjectTagging action. By default, the bucket owner has  this  permission
       and can grant this permission to others.

       To  put  tags  of any other version, use the versionId query parameter.
       You also need permission for the s3:PutObjectVersionTagging action.
          PutObjectTagging has the following special errors. For  more  Amazon
          S3 errors see, Error Responses .

       o InvalidTag - The tag provided was not a valid tag. This error can oc-
         cur if the tag did not pass input validation. For  more  information,
         see Object Tagging .

       o MalformedXML - The XML provided does not match the schema.

       o OperationAborted  -  A conflicting conditional action is currently in
         progress against this resource. Please try again.

       o InternalError - The service was unable to apply the provided  tag  to
         the object.

       The following operations are related to PutObjectTagging :

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name containing the object.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form `` AccessPointName -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` . When you use this action  with  S3
          on  Outposts  through  the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the
          Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more  in-
          formation  about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --key (string)
          Name of the object key.

       --version-id (string)
          The versionId of the object that the tag-set will be added to.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash for the request body.

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for  the  object
          when  using  the  SDK.  This  header will not provide any additional
          functionality if not using the SDK. When sending this header,  there
          must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header sent.
          Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code 400
          Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object integrity in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3  ignores  any  pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --tagging (structure)
          Container for the TagSet and Tag elements

          TagSet -> (list)
              A collection for a set of tags

              (structure)
                 A container of a key value name pair.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Name of the object key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagSet=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TagSet": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status  code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their  re-
          quests. If either the source or destination Amazon S3 bucket has Re-
          quester Pays enabled,  the  requester  will  pay  for  corresponding
          charges  to  copy  the object. For information about downloading ob-
          jects from Requester Pays buckets, see Downloading  Objects  in  Re-
          quester Pays Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set a tag on an object

       The following put-object-tagging example sets a tag with the key desig-
       nation and the value confidential on the specified object.

          aws s3api put-object-tagging \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key doc1.rtf \
              --tagging '{"TagSet": [{ "Key": "designation", "Value": "confidential" }]}'

       This command produces no output.

       The following put-object-tagging example sets multiple tags sets on the
       specified object.

          aws s3api put-object-tagging \
              --bucket my-bucket-example \
              --key doc3.rtf \
              --tagging '{"TagSet": [{ "Key": "designation", "Value": "confidential" }, { "Key": "department", "Value": "finance" }, { "Key": "team", "Value": "payroll" } ]}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       VersionId -> (string)
          The versionId of the object the tag-set was added to.
