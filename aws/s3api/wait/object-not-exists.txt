OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket that contains the object.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
              ``  Bucket_name  .s3express-az_id  .*region*  .amazonaws.com`` .
              Path-style requests are not supported.  Directory  bucket  names
              must  be  unique  in  the chosen Availability Zone. Bucket names
              must follow the format `` bucket_base_name --az-id --x-s3`` (for
              example, `` DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --usw2-az1 --x-s3`` ). For infor-
              mation about bucket naming restrictions,  see  Directory  bucket
              naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Access  points  - When you use this action with an access point,
              you must provide the alias of the access point in place  of  the
              bucket  name or specify the access point ARN. When using the ac-
              cess point ARN, you must direct requests  to  the  access  point
              hostname.  The access point hostname takes the form AccessPoint-
              Name -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When
              using  this  action  with an access point through the Amazon Web
              Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of  the
              bucket  name.  For more information about access point ARNs, see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
                 Access points and Object Lambda access points  are  not  sup-
                 ported by directory buckets.

              S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts  hostname.
              The  S3  on  Outposts hostname takes the form `` AccessPointName
              -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` .
              When  you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon
              Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN  in
              place  of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Out-
              posts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the  Amazon  S3  User
              Guide .

       --if-match (string)
          Return  the  object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same as the
          one specified; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.

          If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are  present
          in the request as follows:

          o If-Match condition evaluates to true , and;

          o If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false ;

          Then Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.

          For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .

       --if-modified-since (timestamp)
          Return  the  object only if it has been modified since the specified
          time; otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.

          If both of  the  If-None-Match  and  If-Modified-Since  headers  are
          present in the request as follows:

          o If-None-Match condition evaluates to false , and;

          o If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true ;

          Then Amazon S3 returns the 304 Not Modified response code.

          For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .

       --if-none-match (string)
          Return  the  object  only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from
          the one specified; otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.

          If both of  the  If-None-Match  and  If-Modified-Since  headers  are
          present in the request as follows:

          o If-None-Match condition evaluates to false , and;

          o If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true ;

          Then Amazon S3 returns the 304 Not Modified response code.

          For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .

       --if-unmodified-since (timestamp)
          Return  the object only if it has not been modified since the speci-
          fied time; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.

          If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are  present
          in the request as follows:

          o If-Match condition evaluates to true , and;

          o If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false ;

          Then Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.

          For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .

       --key (string)
          The object key.

       --range (string)
          HeadObject  returns only the metadata for an object. If the Range is
          satisfiable, only the ContentLength is affected in the response.  If
          the Range is not satisfiable, S3 returns a 416 - Requested Range Not
          Satisfiable error.

       --version-id (string)
          Version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.

          NOTE:
              For directory buckets in this API operation, only the null value
              of the version ID is supported.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for exam-
          ple, AES256).

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to  use
          in  encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then
          it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the  encryption  key.  The
          key  must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according  to
          RFC  1321.  Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has  Requester
          Pays  enabled,  the  requester will pay for corresponding charges to
          copy the object. For information about downloading objects from  Re-
          quester  Pays  buckets,  see  Downloading  Objects in Requester Pays
          Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --part-number (integer)
          Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer be-
          tween 1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' HEAD request for
          the part specified. Useful querying about the size of the  part  and
          the number of parts in this object.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --checksum-mode (string)
          To retrieve the checksum, this parameter must be enabled.

          In  addition, if you enable ChecksumMode and the object is encrypted
          with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services
          KMS), you must have permission to use the kms:Decrypt action for the
          request to succeed.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To wait (pause running) until an object no longer exists

       The following wait object-not-exists example pauses and continues  only
       after it can confirm that the specified object (--key) in the specified
       bucket doesn't exist.

          aws s3api wait object-not-exists \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key doc1.rtf

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None



                                                           OBJECT-NOT-EXISTS()
