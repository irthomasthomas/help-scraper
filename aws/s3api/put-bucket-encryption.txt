PUT-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()                                PUT-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()



NAME
       put-bucket-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       This  action  uses  the encryption subresource to configure default en-
       cryption and Amazon S3 Bucket Keys for an existing bucket.

       By default, all buckets have a default  encryption  configuration  that
       uses  server-side  encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). You
       can optionally configure default  encryption  for  a  bucket  by  using
       server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS)
       or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS  keys
       (DSSE-KMS). If you specify default encryption by using SSE-KMS, you can
       also configure Amazon S3 Bucket Keys . If you  use  PutBucketEncryption
       to  set  your  default  bucket encryption to SSE-KMS, you should verify
       that your KMS key ID is correct. Amazon S3 does not  validate  the  KMS
       key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.

       WARNING:
          This  action  requires  Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. For
          more information, see Authenticating Requests (Amazon  Web  Services
          Signature Version 4) .

       To  use  this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:Pu-
       tEncryptionConfiguration action. The bucket owner has  this  permission
       by  default.  The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For
       more information about permissions, see Permissions Related  to  Bucket
       Subresource  Operations  and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon
       S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          Specifies default encryption for a bucket using server-side  encryp-
          tion  with different key options. By default, all buckets have a de-
          fault encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with
          Amazon  S3  managed  keys (SSE-S3). You can optionally configure de-
          fault encryption for a bucket by using server-side  encryption  with
          an  Amazon Web Services KMS key (SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided key
          (SSE-C). For information about the bucket  default  encryption  fea-
          ture,  see Amazon S3 Bucket Default Encryption in the Amazon S3 User
          Guide .

       --content-md5 (string)
          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the server-side  encryption
          configuration.

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates  the  algorithm used to create the checksum for the object
          when using the SDK. This header  will  not  provide  any  additional
          functionality  if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there
          must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header sent.
          Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code 400
          Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object integrity in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If  you  provide  an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --server-side-encryption-configuration (structure)
          Specifies the default server-side-encryption configuration.

          Rules -> (list)
              Container for information about a particular server-side encryp-
              tion configuration rule.

              (structure)
                 Specifies the default server-side encryption configuration.

                 ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the default server-side encryption to apply to
                     new objects in  the  bucket.  If  a  PUT  Object  request
                     doesn't  specify any server-side encryption, this default
                     encryption will be applied.

                     SSEAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Server-side encryption algorithm to use  for  the  de-
                        fault encryption.

                     KMSMasterKeyID -> (string)
                        Amazon  Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) cus-
                        tomer Amazon Web Services KMS key ID to  use  for  the
                        default  encryption.  This parameter is allowed if and
                        only if SSEAlgorithm is set to aws:kms .

                        You can specify the key ID, key alias, or  the  Amazon
                        Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.

                        o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        o Key                                             ARN:
                          arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        o Key Alias: alias/alias-name

                        If you use a key ID, you can run into a LogDestination
                        undeliverable error when creating a VPC flow log.

                        If you are using encryption with cross-account or Ama-
                        zon  Web  Services  service  operations you must use a
                        fully qualified KMS key ARN. For more information, see
                        Using encryption for cross-account operations .

                        WARNING:
                            Amazon  S3  only supports symmetric encryption KMS
                            keys. For more information, see Asymmetric keys in
                            Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon Web Services
                            Key Management Service Developer Guide .

                 BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3  Bucket  Key
                     with  server-side  encryption using KMS (SSE-KMS) for new
                     objects in the bucket. Existing objects are not affected.
                     Setting  the BucketKeyEnabled element to true causes Ama-
                     zon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key. By default, S3 Bucket Key
                     is not enabled.

                     For  more  information,  see Amazon S3 Bucket Keys in the
                     Amazon S3 User Guide .

          {
            "Rules": [
              {
                "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                  "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"|"aws:kms"|"aws:kms:dsse",
                  "KMSMasterKeyID": "string"
                },
                "BucketKeyEnabled": true|false
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To configure server-side encryption for a bucket

       The following put-bucket-encryption example sets AES256  encryption  as
       the default for the specified bucket.
