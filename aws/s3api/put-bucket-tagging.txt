PUT-BUCKET-TAGGING()                                      PUT-BUCKET-TAGGING()



NAME
       put-bucket-tagging -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Sets the tags for a bucket.

       Use  tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own
       cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services ac-
       count  bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of com-
       bined resources, organize your billing  information  according  to  re-
       sources  with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several
       resources with a specific application  name,  and  then  organize  your
       billing  information  to  see the total cost of that application across
       several services. For more information, see Cost Allocation and Tagging
       and Using Cost Allocation in Amazon S3 Bucket Tags .

       NOTE:
          When  this  operation  sets the tags for a bucket, it will overwrite
          any current tags the bucket already has. You cannot use this  opera-
          tion to add tags to an existing list of tags.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Put-
       BucketTagging action. The bucket owner has this permission  by  default
       and  can  grant  this  permission to others. For more information about
       permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket  Subresource  Operations
       and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources .
          PutBucketTagging  has  the following special errors. For more Amazon
          S3 errors see, Error Responses .

       o InvalidTag - The tag provided was not a valid tag. This error can oc-
         cur  if  the tag did not pass input validation. For more information,
         see Using Cost Allocation in Amazon S3 Bucket Tags .

       o MalformedXML - The XML provided does not match the schema.

       o OperationAborted - A conflicting conditional action is  currently  in
         progress against this resource. Please try again.

       o InternalError  -  The service was unable to apply the provided tag to
         the bucket.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. You must use this
          header  as a message integrity check to verify that the request body
          was not corrupted in transit. For more information, see RFC 1864 .

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for  the  object
          when  you  use  the SDK. This header will not provide any additional
          functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send  this  header,
          there must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header
          sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with  the  HTTP  status
          code 400 Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object in-
          tegrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3  ignores  any  pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --tagging (structure)
          Container for the TagSet and Tag elements.

          TagSet -> (list)
              A collection for a set of tags

              (structure)
                 A container of a key value name pair.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Name of the object key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagSet=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TagSet": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command applies a tagging configuration to a bucket named
       my-bucket:

          aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket my-bucket --tagging file://tagging.json

       The file tagging.json is a JSON document in  the  current  folder  that
       specifies tags:

          {
             "TagSet": [
               {
                 "Key": "organization",
                 "Value": "marketing"
               }
             ]
          }

       Or apply a tagging configuration to my-bucket directly from the command
       line:

          aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket my-bucket --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=organization,Value=marketing}]'

OUTPUT
       None
