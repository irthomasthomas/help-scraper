LIST-BUCKET-ANALYTICS-CONFIGURATIONS()  LIST-BUCKET-ANALYTICS-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       list-bucket-analytics-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Lists  the  analytics configurations for the bucket. You can have up to
       1,000 analytics configurations per bucket.

       This action supports list pagination and does not return more than  100
       configurations  at a time. You should always check the IsTruncated ele-
       ment in the response. If there are  no  more  configurations  to  list,
       IsTruncated  is set to false. If there are more configurations to list,
       IsTruncated is set to true, and there will be a value in  NextContinua-
       tionToken  .  You  use  the NextContinuationToken value to continue the
       pagination of the list by passing the value  in  continuation-token  in
       the request to GET the next page.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Get-
       AnalyticsConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permission  by
       default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Re-
       sources .

       For information about Amazon S3 analytics feature, see Amazon  S3  Ana-
       lytics  Storage Class Analysis .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket from which analytics configurations  are  re-
          trieved.

       --continuation-token (string)
          The  ContinuationToken that represents a placeholder from where this
          request should begin.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of analytics configurations for a bucket

       The  following list-bucket-analytics-configurations retrieves a list of
       analytics configurations for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api list-bucket-analytics-configurations \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "AnalyticsConfigurationList": [
                  {
                      "StorageClassAnalysis": {},
                      "Id": "1"
                  }
              ],
              "IsTruncated": false
          }

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the returned list of analytics  configurations  is
          complete.  A  value  of true indicates that the list is not complete
          and the NextContinuationToken will be provided for a subsequent  re-
          quest.

       ContinuationToken -> (string)
          The  marker that is used as a starting point for this analytics con-
          figuration list response. This value is present if it  was  sent  in
          the request.

       NextContinuationToken -> (string)
          NextContinuationToken  is sent when isTruncated is true, which indi-
          cates that there are more analytics configurations to list. The next
          request  must  include this NextContinuationToken . The token is ob-
          fuscated and is not a usable value.

       AnalyticsConfigurationList -> (list)
          The list of analytics configurations for a bucket.

                 And -> (structure)

                 made available to analyze  the  tradeoffs  between  different
                 storage classes.

                 DataExport -> (structure)
                     Specifies  how data related to the storage class analysis

                                   Although  this  value   is   optional,   we
                                   strongly  recommend that you set it to help
                                   prevent problems if the destination  bucket
                                   ownership changes.
