GET-BUCKET-ACCELERATE-CONFIGURATION()    GET-BUCKET-ACCELERATE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       get-bucket-accelerate-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

       This  implementation  of the GET action uses the accelerate subresource
       to return the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket, which is  either
       Enabled   or   Suspended   .  Amazon  S3  Transfer  Acceleration  is  a
       bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data  transfers
       to and from Amazon S3.

       To  use  this  operation,  you  must  have  permission  to  perform the
       s3:GetAccelerateConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permis-
       sion  by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others.
       For more information about  permissions,  see  Permissions  Related  to
       Bucket  Subresource  Operations and Managing Access Permissions to your
       Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       You set the Transfer Acceleration state of an existing  bucket  to  En-
       abled or Suspended by using the PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration opera-
       tion.

       A GET accelerate request does not return a state  value  for  a  bucket
       that  has  no transfer acceleration state. A bucket has no Transfer Ac-
       celeration state if a state has never been set on the bucket.

       For more information about transfer acceleration, see Transfer Acceler-
       ation in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-accelerate-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which the accelerate configuration is re-
          trieved.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their  re-
          quests.  If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
          Pays enabled, the requester will pay for  corresponding  charges  to
          copy  the object. For information about downloading objects from Re-
          quester Pays buckets, see  Downloading  Objects  in  Requester  Pays
          Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the accelerate configuration of a bucket

       The following get-bucket-accelerate-configuration example retrieves the
       accelerate configuration for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api get-bucket-accelerate-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "Status": "Enabled"
          }

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          The accelerate configuration of the bucket.

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
