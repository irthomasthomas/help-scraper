LIST-OBJECTS()                                                  LIST-OBJECTS()



NAME
       list-objects -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Returns  some  or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket. You can
       use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset  of
       the objects in a bucket. A 200 OK response can contain valid or invalid
       XML. Be sure to design your application to parse the  contents  of  the
       response and handle it appropriately.

       WARNING:
          This  action  has  been revised. We recommend that you use the newer
          version, ListObjectsV2 , when developing applications. For  backward
          compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support ListObjects .

       The following operations are related to ListObjects :

       o ListObjectsV2

       o GetObject

       o PutObject

       o CreateBucket

       o ListBuckets

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-objects is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Contents, CommonPrefixes

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket containing the objects.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
              `` Bucket_name  .s3express-az_id  .*region*  .amazonaws.com``  .
              Path-style  requests  are  not supported. Directory bucket names
              must be unique in the chosen  Availability  Zone.  Bucket  names
              must follow the format `` bucket_base_name --az-id --x-s3`` (for
              example, `` DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --usw2-az1 --x-s3`` ). For infor-
              mation  about  bucket  naming restrictions, see Directory bucket
              naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Access points - When you use this action with an  access  point,
              you  must  provide the alias of the access point in place of the
              bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the  ac-
              cess  point  ARN,  you  must direct requests to the access point
              hostname. The access point hostname takes the form  AccessPoint-
              Name  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com. When
              using this action with an access point through  the  Amazon  Web
              Services  SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the
              bucket name. For more information about access point  ARNs,  see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
                 Access  points  and  Object Lambda access points are not sup-
                 ported by directory buckets.

              S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts,  you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname.
              The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the  form  ``  AccessPointName
              -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` .
              When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the  Amazon
              Web  Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in
              place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on  Out-
              posts  ARNs,  see  What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User
              Guide .

       --delimiter (string)
          A delimiter is a character that you use to group keys.

       --encoding-type (string)
          Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys  in  the  response  and
          specifies  the encoding method to use. An object key can contain any
          Unicode character; however, the XML 1.0  parser  cannot  parse  some
          characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For
          characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add  this  pa-
          rameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

          Possible values:

          o url

       --prefix (string)
          Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for
          the list objects request. Bucket owners need not specify this param-
          eter in their requests.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --optional-object-attributes (list)
          Specifies  the  optional  fields  that  you want returned in the re-
          sponse. Fields that you do not specify are not returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            RestoreStatus

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The  following  example  uses  the  list-objects command to display the
       names of all the objects in the specified bucket:

          aws s3api list-objects --bucket text-content --query 'Contents[].{Key: Key, Size: Size}'

       The example uses the --query argument to filter the output of  list-ob-
       jects down to the key value and size for each object

       For  more information about objects, see Working with Amazon S3 Objects
       in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether Amazon S3 returned all of the  results
          that satisfied the search criteria.

       Marker -> (string)
          Indicates  where in the bucket listing begins. Marker is included in
          the response if it was sent with the request.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When the response is truncated (the IsTruncated element value in the
          response  is  true  ), you can use the key name in this field as the
          marker parameter in the subsequent request to get the  next  set  of
          objects. Amazon S3 lists objects in alphabetical order.

          NOTE:
              This  element is returned only if you have the delimiter request
              parameter specified.  If  the  response  does  not  include  the
              NextMarker element and it is truncated, you can use the value of
              the last Key element in the response as the marker parameter  in
              the subsequent request to get the next set of object keys.

       Contents -> (list)
          Metadata about each object returned.

          (structure)
              An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key
                 to retrieve the object.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Creation date of the object.

              ETag -> (string)
                 The entity tag is a hash of the  object.  The  ETag  reflects
                 changes  only to the contents of an object, not its metadata.
                 The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object  data.
                 Whether  or  not  it is depends on how the object was created
                 and how it is encrypted as described below:

                 o Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy op-
                   eration, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Con-
                   sole, and are encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have  ETags
                   that are an MD5 digest of their object data.

                 o Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy op-
                   eration, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Con-
                   sole,  and  are  encrypted  by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags
                   that are not an MD5 digest of their object data.

                 o If an object is created by either the Multipart  Upload  or
                   Part Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regard-
                   less of the method of encryption. If an  object  is  larger
                   than 16 MB, the Amazon Web Services Management Console will
                   upload or copy that  object  as  a  Multipart  Upload,  and
                   therefore the ETag will not be an MD5 digest.

                 NOTE:
                     Directory  buckets  -  MD5  is not supported by directory
                     buckets.

              ChecksumAlgorithm -> (list)
                 The algorithm that was used to create a checksum of  the  ob-
                 ject.

                 (string)

              Size -> (long)
                 Size in bytes of the object

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The class of storage used to store the object.

                 NOTE:
                     Directory  buckets - Only the S3 Express One Zone storage
                     class is supported by directory buckets to store objects.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 The owner of the object

                 NOTE:
                     Directory buckets - The bucket owner is returned  as  the
                     object owner.

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container  for  the display name of the owner. This value
                     is only supported in the following  Amazon  Web  Services
                     Regions:

                     o US East (N. Virginia)

                     o US West (N. California)

                     o US West (Oregon)

                     o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

                     o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                     o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                     o Europe (Ireland)

                     o South America (So Paulo)

                     NOTE:
                        This  functionality  is  not  supported  for directory
                        buckets.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

              RestoreStatus -> (structure)
                 Specifies the restoration status of  an  object.  Objects  in
                 certain  storage  classes must be restored before they can be
                 retrieved. For more information about these  storage  classes
                 and  how  to  work  with  archived  objects, see Working with
                 archived objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     This functionality is not supported for  directory  buck-
                     ets.  Only  the S3 Express One Zone storage class is sup-
                     ported by directory buckets to store objects.

                 IsRestoreInProgress -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the object is currently being restored.
                     If  the object restoration is in progress, the header re-
                     turns the value TRUE . For example:
                        x-amz-optional-object-attributes:         IsRestoreIn-
                        Progress="true"

                     If  the  object restoration has completed, the header re-
                     turns the value FALSE . For example:
                        x-amz-optional-object-attributes:         IsRestoreIn-
                        Progress="false",                       RestoreExpiry-
                        Date="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"

                     If the object hasn't been restored, there  is  no  header
                     response.

                 RestoreExpiryDate -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates  when the restored copy will expire. This value
                     is populated only if the  object  has  already  been  re-
                     stored. For example:
                        x-amz-optional-object-attributes:         IsRestoreIn-
                        Progress="false",                       RestoreExpiry-
                        Date="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"

       Name -> (string)
          The bucket name.

       Prefix -> (string)
          Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

       Delimiter -> (string)
          Causes  keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the
          first occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single  re-
          sult  element in the CommonPrefixes collection. These rolled-up keys
          are not returned elsewhere in the response.  Each  rolled-up  result
          counts as only one return against the MaxKeys value.

       MaxKeys -> (integer)
          The maximum number of keys returned in the response body.

       CommonPrefixes -> (list)
          All  of the keys (up to 1,000) rolled up in a common prefix count as
          a single return when calculating the number of returns.

          A response can contain CommonPrefixes only if you specify  a  delim-
          iter.
              CommonPrefixes contains all (if there are any) keys between Pre-
              fix and the next occurrence of the string specified by  the  de-
              limiter.

              CommonPrefixes  lists  keys  that act like subdirectories in the
              directory specified by Prefix .

          For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/
          ),  as  in  notes/summer/july , the common prefix is notes/summer/ .
          All of the keys that roll up into a common prefix count as a  single
          return when calculating the number of returns.

          (structure)
              Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the
              next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter.  Common-
              Prefixes  lists  keys that act like subdirectories in the direc-
              tory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix  is  notes/
              and  the  delimiter  is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the
              common prefix is notes/summer/.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Container for the specified common prefix.

       EncodingType -> (string)
          Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object  keys  in  the  re-
          sponse.  If using url , non-ASCII characters used in an object's key
          name will be URL encoded. For example, the  object  test_file(3).png
          will appear as test_file%283%29.png .

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
