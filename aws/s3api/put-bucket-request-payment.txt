       rameter  enables the bucket owner (only) to specify that the person re-
       questing the download will be charged for the download. For more infor-
       mation, see Requester Pays Buckets .

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-request-payment
          --bucket <value>
          [--content-md5 <value>]
          [--checksum-algorithm <value>]
          --request-payment-configuration <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. You must use this
          header as a message integrity check to verify that the request  body
          was not corrupted in transit. For more information, see RFC 1864 .

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates  the  algorithm used to create the checksum for the object
          when using the SDK. This header  will  not  provide  any  additional
          functionality  if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there
          must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header sent.
          Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code 400
          Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object integrity in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If  you  provide  an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --request-payment-configuration (structure)
          Container for Payer.

          Payer -> (string)
              Specifies who pays for the download and request fees.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Payer=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Payer": "Requester"|"BucketOwner"
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To enable ``requester pays`` configuration for a bucket

       The following put-bucket-request-payment example enables requester pays
       for the specified bucket.

              --request-payment-configuration '{"Payer":"Requester"}'

       This command produces no output.

       Example 2: To disable ``requester pays`` configuration for a bucket

       The  following  put-bucket-request-payment  example  disables requester
       pays for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-request-payment \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --request-payment-configuration '{"Payer":"BucketOwner"}'

       This command produces no output.
