LIST-MULTIPART-UPLOADS()                              LIST-MULTIPART-UPLOADS()



NAME
       list-multipart-uploads -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  lists  in-progress  multipart  uploads in a bucket. An
       in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initi-
       ated  by  the  CreateMultipartUpload request, but has not yet been com-
       pleted or aborted.

       NOTE:
          Directory buckets - If multipart uploads in a directory  bucket  are
          in  progress,  you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress
          multipart uploads are aborted or completed.

       The ListMultipartUploads operation returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart
       uploads  in  the response. The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also
       the default value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a re-
       sponse  by  specifying  the max-uploads request parameter. If there are
       more than 1,000 multipart uploads  that  satisfy  your  ListMultipartU-
       ploads  request,  the  response returns an IsTruncated element with the
       value of true , a NextKeyMarker element, and a NextUploadIdMarker  ele-
       ment.  To list the remaining multipart uploads, you need to make subse-
       quent ListMultipartUploads requests. In  these  requests,  include  two
       query  parameters:  key-marker  and upload-id-marker . Set the value of
       key-marker to the NextKeyMarker value from the previous response. Simi-
       larly,  set  the  value  of  upload-id-marker to the NextUploadIdMarker
       value from the previous response.

       NOTE:
          Directory buckets - The upload-id-marker element and the NextUpload-
          IdMarker  element aren't supported by directory buckets. To list the
          additional multipart uploads, you only need  to  set  the  value  of
          key-marker to the NextKeyMarker value from the previous response.

       For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Us-
       ing Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
              Directory buckets - For directory buckets,  you  must  make  re-
              quests  for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These end-
              points support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
              ``
              https://bucket_name    .s3express-az_id    .*region*    .amazon-
              aws.com/key-name `` . Path-style requests are not supported. For
              more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon
              S3 User Guide .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 54)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          Permissions

       o General  purpose  bucket  permissions - For information about permis-
         sions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart  Upload
         and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       o Directory  bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation
         on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the `  CreateSession
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html`__
         API operation  for  session-based  authorization.  Specifically,  you
         grant  the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket
         in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy.  Then,  you  make
         the  CreateSession  API call on the bucket to obtain a session token.
         With the session token in your request header, you can make  API  re-
         quests  to  this operation. After the session token expires, you make
         another CreateSession API call to generate a new  session  token  for
         use.  Amazon  Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the
         session token automatically to avoid  service  interruptions  when  a
         session expires. For more information about authorization, see ` Cre-
         ateSession
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html`__
         .

         Sorting of multipart uploads in response

       o General purpose bucket - In the  ListMultipartUploads  response,  the
         multipart uploads are sorted based on two criteria:

         o Key-based  sorting  - Multipart uploads are initially sorted in as-
           cending order based on their object keys.

         o Time-based sorting - For uploads that share the  same  object  key,
           they are further sorted in ascending order based on the upload ini-
           tiation time. Among uploads with the same key,  the  one  that  was
           initiated  first  will  appear  before the ones that were initiated
           later.

       o Directory bucket - In the ListMultipartUploads response,  the  multi-
         part  uploads  aren't  sorted  lexicographically  based on the object
         keys.

         HTTP Host header syntax
          Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax  is  ``  Bucket_name
          .s3express-az_id .*region* .amazonaws.com`` .

       The following operations are related to ListMultipartUploads :

       o CreateMultipartUpload

       o UploadPart

       o CompleteMultipartUpload

       o ListParts

       o AbortMultipartUpload

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-multipart-uploads is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Uploads, CommonPrefixes

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
              `` Bucket_name  .s3express-az_id  .*region*  .amazonaws.com``  .
              Path-style  requests  are  not supported. Directory bucket names
              must be unique in the chosen  Availability  Zone.  Bucket  names
              must follow the format `` bucket_base_name --az-id --x-s3`` (for
              example, `` DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --usw2-az1 --x-s3`` ). For infor-
              mation  about  bucket  naming restrictions, see Directory bucket
              naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Access points - When you use this action with an  access  point,
              you  must  provide the alias of the access point in place of the
              bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the  ac-
              cess  point  ARN,  you  must direct requests to the access point
              hostname. The access point hostname takes the form  AccessPoint-
              Name  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com. When
              using this action with an access point through  the  Amazon  Web
              Services  SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the
              bucket name. For more information about access point  ARNs,  see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
                 Access  points  and  Object Lambda access points are not sup-
                 ported by directory buckets.

              S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts,  you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname.
              The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the  form  ``  AccessPointName
              -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` .
              When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the  Amazon
              Web  Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in
              place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on  Out-
              posts  ARNs,  see  What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User
              Guide .

       --delimiter (string)
          Character you use to group keys.

          All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if  speci-
          fied, and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are
          grouped under a single result element, CommonPrefixes . If you don't
          specify  the  prefix parameter, then the substring starts at the be-
          ginning of the key. The keys that are grouped  under  CommonPrefixes
          result element are not returned elsewhere in the response.

          NOTE:
              Directory  buckets  -  For directory buckets, / is the only sup-
              ported delimiter.

       --encoding-type (string)
          Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys  in  the  response  and
          specifies  the encoding method to use. An object key can contain any
          Unicode character; however, the XML 1.0  parser  cannot  parse  some
          characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For
          characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add  this  pa-
          rameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

          Possible values:

          o url

       --prefix (string)
          Lists  in-progress  uploads  only for those keys that begin with the
          specified prefix. You can use prefixes to  separate  a  bucket  into
          different  grouping  of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make
          groups in the same way that you'd use a folder in a file system.)

          NOTE:
              Directory buckets - For directory buckets,  only  prefixes  that
              end in a delimiter (/ ) are supported.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their  re-
          quests.  If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
          Pays enabled, the requester will pay for  corresponding  charges  to
          copy  the object. For information about downloading objects from Re-
          quester Pays buckets, see  Downloading  Objects  in  Requester  Pays
          Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command lists all of the active multipart uploads  for  a
       bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api list-multipart-uploads --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "Uploads": [
                  {
                      "Initiator": {

       In  progress  multipart  uploads incur storage costs in Amazon S3. Com-
       plete or abort an active multipart upload to remove its parts from your
       account.

OUTPUT
       Bucket -> (string)
          The  name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.
          Does not return the access point ARN or access point alias if used.

       KeyMarker -> (string)
          The key at or after which the listing began.

       UploadIdMarker -> (string)
          Together with key-marker, specifies the multipart upload after which
          listing  should  begin.  If  key-marker  is  not  specified, the up-
          load-id-marker parameter is ignored. Otherwise,  any  multipart  up-
          loads  for  a  key  equal to the key-marker might be included in the
          list only if they have an upload ID lexicographically  greater  than
          the specified upload-id-marker .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       NextKeyMarker -> (string)
          When  a  list  is  truncated,  this element specifies the value that
          should be used for the key-marker request parameter in a  subsequent
          request.

       Prefix -> (string)
          When  a  prefix  is provided in the request, this field contains the
          specified prefix. The result contains only keys  starting  with  the
          specified prefix.

          NOTE:
              Directory  buckets  -  For directory buckets, only prefixes that
              end in a delimiter (/ ) are supported.

       Delimiter -> (string)
          Contains the delimiter you specified in the request.  If  you  don't
          specify a delimiter in your request, this element is absent from the
          response.

          NOTE:
              Directory buckets - For directory buckets, / is  the  only  sup-
              ported delimiter.

       NextUploadIdMarker -> (string)
          When  a  list  is  truncated,  this element specifies the value that
          should be used for the upload-id-marker request parameter in a  sub-
          sequent request.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       MaxUploads -> (integer)
          Maximum number of multipart uploads that could have been included in
          the response.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the returned list of multipart  uploads  is  trun-
          cated.  A  value  of true indicates that the list was truncated. The
          list can be truncated if the number of multipart uploads exceeds the
          limit allowed or specified by max uploads.

       Uploads -> (list)
          Container  for  elements related to a particular multipart upload. A
          response can contain zero or more Upload elements.

          (structure)
              Container for the MultipartUpload for the Amazon S3 object.

              UploadId -> (string)
                 Upload ID that identifies the multipart upload.

              Key -> (string)
                 Key of the object for which the multipart upload  was  initi-
                 ated.

              Initiated -> (timestamp)

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The class of storage used to store the object.

                 NOTE:
                     Directory  buckets - Only the S3 Express One Zone storage
                     class is supported by directory buckets to store objects.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 Specifies the owner of the object that is part of the  multi-
                 part upload.

                 NOTE:
                     Directory  buckets  - The bucket owner is returned as the
                     object owner for all the objects.

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container for the display name of the owner.  This  value
                     is  only  supported  in the following Amazon Web Services
                     Regions:

                     o US East (N. Virginia)

                     o US West (N. California)

                     o US West (Oregon)

                     NOTE:
                        This functionality  is  not  supported  for  directory
                        buckets.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

              Initiator -> (structure)
                 Identifies who initiated the multipart upload.

                 ID -> (string)
                     If  the  principal  is an Amazon Web Services account, it
                     provides the Canonical User ID. If the  principal  is  an
                     IAM User, it provides a user ARN value.

                     NOTE:
                        Directory  buckets - If the principal is an Amazon Web
                        Services account, it provides the Amazon Web  Services
                        account  ID.  If the principal is an IAM User, it pro-
                        vides a user ARN value.

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Name of the Principal.

                     NOTE:
                        This functionality  is  not  supported  for  directory
                        buckets.

              ChecksumAlgorithm -> (string)
                 The  algorithm  that was used to create a checksum of the ob-
                 ject.

       CommonPrefixes -> (list)
          If you specify a delimiter in the request, then the  result  returns
          each  distinct  key  prefix containing the delimiter in a CommonPre-
          fixes element. The distinct key prefixes are returned in the  Prefix
          child element.

          NOTE:
              Directory  buckets  -  For directory buckets, only prefixes that
              end in a delimiter (/ ) are supported.

          (structure)
              Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the
              next  occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. Common-
              Prefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in  the  direc-
              tory  specified  by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/
              and the delimiter is a slash (/) as  in  notes/summer/july,  the
              common prefix is notes/summer/.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Container for the specified common prefix.

       EncodingType -> (string)
          Encoding  type  used  by  Amazon S3 to encode object keys in the re-
          sponse.

          If you specify the encoding-type request parameter,  Amazon  S3  in-
          cludes  this  element  in the response, and returns encoded key name
          values in the following response elements:
              Delimiter , KeyMarker , Prefix , NextKeyMarker , Key .

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
