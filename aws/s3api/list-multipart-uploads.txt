LIST-MULTIPART-UPLOADS()                              LIST-MULTIPART-UPLOADS()



NAME
       list-multipart-uploads -

DESCRIPTION
       This  action lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress multi-
       part upload is a multipart upload that has  been  initiated  using  the
       Initiate  Multipart  Upload  request, but has not yet been completed or
       aborted.

       This action returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads  in  the  response.
       1,000 multipart uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response can
       include, which is also the default value. You  can  further  limit  the
       number of uploads in a response by specifying the max-uploads parameter
       in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the list  cri-
       teria,  the response will contain an IsTruncated element with the value
       true. To list the additional multipart uploads, use the key-marker  and
       upload-id-marker request parameters.

       In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has
       initiated more than one multipart upload using  the  same  object  key,
       then uploads in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, up-
       loads are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload  ini-
       tiation time.

       For  more information on multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using
       Multipart Upload .

       For information on permissions required to  use  the  multipart  upload
       API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions .

       The following operations are related to ListMultipartUploads :

       list-multipart-uploads is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Uploads, CommonPrefixes

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

          When using this action with an access point,  you  must  direct  re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .ama-
          zonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in  place
          of  the  bucket  name. For more information about access point ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the form `` AccessPointName -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using Amazon S3 on  Outposts  in  the
          Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --delimiter (string)
          Character you use to group keys.

          All  keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if speci-
          fied, and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are
          grouped under a single result element, CommonPrefixes . If you don't
          specify the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at  the  be-
          ginning  of  the key. The keys that are grouped under CommonPrefixes
          result element are not returned elsewhere in the response.

       --encoding-type (string)
          Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys  in  the  response  and
          specifies  the encoding method to use. An object key may contain any
          Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some charac-
          ters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For char-
          acters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter
          to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

          Possible values:

          o url

       --prefix (string)
          Lists  in-progress  uploads  only for those keys that begin with the
          specified prefix. You can use prefixes to  separate  a  bucket  into
          different  grouping  of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make
          groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       account.

OUTPUT
       Bucket -> (string)
          The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was  initiated.
          Does not return the access point ARN or access point alias if used.

       KeyMarker -> (string)
          The key at or after which the listing began.

       UploadIdMarker -> (string)
          Upload ID after which listing began.

       NextKeyMarker -> (string)
          When  a  list  is  truncated,  this element specifies the value that
          should be used for the key-marker request parameter in a  subsequent
          request.

       Prefix -> (string)
          When  a  prefix  is provided in the request, this field contains the
          specified prefix. The result contains only keys  starting  with  the
          specified prefix.

       Delimiter -> (string)
          Contains  the  delimiter  you specified in the request. If you don't
          specify a delimiter in your request, this element is absent from the
          response.

       NextUploadIdMarker -> (string)
          When  a  list  is  truncated,  this element specifies the value that
          should be used for the upload-id-marker request parameter in a  sub-
          sequent request.

       MaxUploads -> (integer)
          Maximum number of multipart uploads that could have been included in
          the response.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the returned list of multipart  uploads  is  trun-
          cated.  A  value  of true indicates that the list was truncated. The
          list can be truncated if the number of multipart uploads exceeds the
          limit allowed or specified by max uploads.

       Uploads -> (list)
          Container  for  elements related to a particular multipart upload. A
          response can contain zero or more Upload elements.

          (structure)
              Container for the MultipartUpload for the Amazon S3 object.

              UploadId -> (string)
                 Upload ID that identifies the multipart upload.

              Key -> (string)
                 Key of the object for which the multipart upload  was  initi-
                 ated.

              Initiated -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time at which the multipart upload was initiated.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The class of storage used to store the object.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the owner of the object that is part of the multi-
                 part upload.

                 DisplayName -> (string)

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

              Initiator -> (structure)
                 Identifies who initiated the multipart upload.

                 ID -> (string)
                     If the principal is an Amazon Web  Services  account,  it
                     provides  the  Canonical  User ID. If the principal is an
                     IAM User, it provides a user ARN value.

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Name of the Principal.

              ChecksumAlgorithm -> (string)
                 The algorithm that was used to create a checksum of  the  ob-
                 ject.

       CommonPrefixes -> (list)
          If  you  specify a delimiter in the request, then the result returns
          each distinct key prefix containing the delimiter  in  a  CommonPre-
          fixes  element. The distinct key prefixes are returned in the Prefix
          child element.

          (structure)
              Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the
              next  occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. Common-
              Prefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in  the  direc-
              tory  specified  by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/
              and the delimiter is a slash (/) as  in  notes/summer/july,  the
              common prefix is notes/summer/.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Container for the specified common prefix.

       EncodingType -> (string)
          Encoding  type  used  by  Amazon S3 to encode object keys in the re-
          sponse.

          If you specify encoding-type request parameter, Amazon  S3  includes
          this element in the response, and returns encoded key name values in
          the following response elements:
              Delimiter , KeyMarker , Prefix , NextKeyMarker , Key .
