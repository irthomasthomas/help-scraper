GET-BUCKET-POLICY()                                        GET-BUCKET-POLICY()



NAME
       get-bucket-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity
       other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account  that  owns
       the  bucket, the calling identity must have the GetBucketPolicy permis-
       sions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's  account
       in order to use this operation.

       If  you don't have GetBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a 403
       Access Denied error. If you have the correct  permissions,  but  you're
       not  using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Ama-
       zon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

       WARNING:
          To ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out
          of  their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's Amazon
          Web Services account can perform the GetBucketPolicy , PutBucketPol-
          icy  , and DeleteBucketPolicy API actions, even if their bucket pol-
          icy explicitly denies the root principal's access. Bucket owner root
          principals  can only be blocked from performing these API actions by
          VPC endpoint policies and Amazon Web  Services  Organizations  poli-
          cies.

       To use this API operation against an access point, provide the alias of
       the access point in place of the bucket name.

       To use this API operation against an Object Lambda access  point,  pro-
       vide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket
       name. If the Object Lambda access point  alias  in  a  request  is  not
       valid,  the  error  code  InvalidAccessPointAliasError is returned. For
       more information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError , see List of Error
       Codes .

       For  more  information about bucket policies, see Using Bucket Policies
       and User Policies .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name for which to get the bucket policy.

          To use this API operation against an access point, provide the alias
          of the access point in place of the bucket name.

          To  use  this  API  operation against an Object Lambda access point,
          provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of  the
          bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is
          not valid, the error code InvalidAccessPointAliasError is  returned.
          For  more  information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError , see List
          of Error Codes .

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command retrieves the bucket policy for  a  bucket  named
       my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "Policy": "{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":\"*\",\"Action\":\"s3:GetObject\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*\"},{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Deny\",\"Principal\":\"*\",\"Action\":\"s3:GetObject\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/secret/*\"}]}"
          }

   Get and put a bucket policy
       The  following  example  shows how you can download an Amazon S3 bucket
       policy, make modifications to the file, and then use  put-bucket-policy
       to  apply the modified bucket policy.  To download the bucket policy to
       a file, you can run:

          aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket mybucket --query Policy --output text > policy.json

       You can then modify the policy.json file as needed.   Finally  you  can
       apply this modified policy back to the S3 bucket by running:

          aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket mybucket --policy file://policy.json

OUTPUT
       Policy -> (string)
          The bucket policy as a JSON document.
