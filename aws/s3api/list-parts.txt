LIST-PARTS()                                                      LIST-PARTS()



NAME
       list-parts -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  parts  that have been uploaded for a specific multipart up-
       load.

       To use this operation, you must provide the upload ID in  the  request.
       You  obtain  this uploadID by sending the initiate multipart upload re-
       quest through CreateMultipartUpload .

       The ListParts request returns a maximum of 1,000  uploaded  parts.  The
       limit  of  1,000  parts is also the default value. You can restrict the
       number of parts in a response by specifying the max-parts  request  pa-
       rameter.  If  your  multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts,
       the response returns an IsTruncated field with the value of true ,  and
       a  NextPartNumberMarker  element.  To list remaining uploaded parts, in
       subsequent ListParts requests,  include  the  part-number-marker  query
       string  parameter  and  set its value to the NextPartNumberMarker field
       value from the previous response.

       For more information on multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects  Using
       Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
              Directory  buckets  -  For  directory buckets, you must make re-
              quests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These  end-
              points support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
              ``
              https://bucket_name    .s3express-az_id    .*region*    .amazon-
              aws.com/key-name `` . Path-style requests are not supported. For
              more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon
              S3 User Guide .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 38)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          Permissions

       o General purpose bucket permissions - For  information  about  permis-
         sions  required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload
         and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide . If the upload was  cre-
         ated  using  server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS)
         keys (SSE-KMS) or dual-layer server-side encryption with  Amazon  Web
         Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), you must have permission to the kms:De-
         crypt action for the ListParts request to succeed.

       o Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API  operation
         on  a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the ` CreateSession
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html`__
         API  operation  for  session-based  authorization.  Specifically, you
         grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory  bucket
         in  a  bucket  policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make
         the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a  session  token.
         With  the  session token in your request header, you can make API re-
         quests to this operation. After the session token expires,  you  make
         another  CreateSession  API  call to generate a new session token for
         use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and  refresh  the
         session  token  automatically  to  avoid service interruptions when a
         session expires. For more information about authorization, see ` Cre-
         ateSession
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html`__
         .

         HTTP Host header syntax
          Directory  buckets  -  The HTTP Host header syntax is `` Bucket_name
          .s3express-az_id .*region* .amazonaws.com`` .

       The following operations are related to ListParts :

       o CreateMultipartUpload

       o UploadPart

       o CompleteMultipartUpload

       o AbortMultipartUpload

       o GetObjectAttributes

       o ListMultipartUploads

       list-parts is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Parts

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket to which the parts are being uploaded.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
              ``  Bucket_name  .s3express-az_id  .*region*  .amazonaws.com`` .
              Path-style requests are not supported.  Directory  bucket  names
              must  be  unique  in  the chosen Availability Zone. Bucket names
              must follow the format `` bucket_base_name --az-id --x-s3`` (for
              example, `` DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --usw2-az1 --x-s3`` ). For infor-
              mation about bucket naming restrictions,  see  Directory  bucket
              naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Access  points  - When you use this action with an access point,
              you must provide the alias of the access point in place  of  the
              bucket  name or specify the access point ARN. When using the ac-
              cess point ARN, you must direct requests  to  the  access  point
              hostname.  The access point hostname takes the form AccessPoint-
              Name -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When
              using  this  action  with an access point through the Amazon Web
              Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of  the
              bucket  name.  For more information about access point ARNs, see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
                 Access points and Object Lambda access points  are  not  sup-
                 ported by directory buckets.

              S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts  hostname.
              The  S3  on  Outposts hostname takes the form `` AccessPointName
              -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` .
              When  you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon
              Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN  in
              place  of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Out-
              posts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the  Amazon  S3  User
              Guide .

       --key (string)
          Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

       --upload-id (string)
          Upload  ID  identifying  the  multipart upload whose parts are being
          listed.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has  Requester
          Pays  enabled,  the  requester will pay for corresponding charges to
          copy the object. For information about downloading objects from  Re-
          quester  Pays  buckets,  see  Downloading  Objects in Requester Pays
          Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          The server-side encryption (SSE) algorithm used to encrypt  the  ob-
          ject.  This parameter is needed only when the object was created us-
          ing a checksum algorithm. For more information, see Protecting  data
          using SSE-C keys in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          The  server-side encryption (SSE) customer managed key. This parame-
          ter is needed only when the object was created using a checksum  al-
          gorithm.  For more information, see Protecting data using SSE-C keys
          in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          The MD5 server-side encryption (SSE) customer managed key. This  pa-
          rameter  is needed only when the object was created using a checksum
          algorithm. For more information, see  Protecting  data  using  SSE-C
          keys in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The  following  command  lists all of the parts that have been uploaded
       for a multipart upload with key multipart/01 in the bucket my-bucket:

OUTPUT
       AbortDate -> (timestamp)
          If the bucket has a lifecycle rule  configured  with  an  action  to
          abort  incomplete  multipart uploads and the prefix in the lifecycle
          rule matches the object name in the request, then the  response  in-
          cludes  this  header  indicating when the initiated multipart upload
          will become eligible for abort operation. For more information,  see
          Aborting  Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Con-
          figuration .

          The response will also include the x-amz-abort-rule-id  header  that
          will provide the ID of the lifecycle configuration rule that defines
          this action.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       AbortRuleId -> (string)
          This header is returned along with the x-amz-abort-date  header.  It
          identifies  applicable lifecycle configuration rule that defines the
          action to abort incomplete multipart uploads.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       Bucket -> (string)
          The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was  initiated.
          Does not return the access point ARN or access point alias if used.

       Key -> (string)
          Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

       UploadId -> (string)
          Upload  ID  identifying  the  multipart upload whose parts are being
          listed.

       PartNumberMarker -> (integer)
          Specifies the part after which listing should begin. Only parts with
          higher part numbers will be listed.

       NextPartNumberMarker -> (integer)
          When  a  list  is truncated, this element specifies the last part in
          the list, as well as the value to use for the part-number-marker re-
          quest parameter in a subsequent request.

       MaxParts -> (integer)
          Maximum number of parts that were allowed in the response.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the  returned list of parts is truncated. A true
          value indicates that the list was truncated. A list can be truncated
          if  the  number  of parts exceeds the limit returned in the MaxParts
          element.

       Parts -> (list)
          Container for elements related to a particular part. A response  can
          contain zero or more Part elements.

          (structure)
              Container for elements related to a part.

              PartNumber -> (integer)
                 Part  number identifying the part. This is a positive integer
                 between 1 and 10,000.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time at which the part was uploaded.

              ETag -> (string)
                 Entity tag returned when the part was uploaded.

              Size -> (long)
                 Size in bytes of the uploaded part data.

              ChecksumCRC32 -> (string)
                 This header can be used as a data integrity check  to  verify
                 that  the  data received is the same data that was originally
                 sent. This header specifies the base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC-32
                 checksum  of  the  object. For more information, see Checking

              ChecksumCRC32C -> (string)
                 The base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC-32C checksum  of  the  object.
                 This will only be present if it was uploaded with the object.
                 When you use an API operation on an object that was  uploaded
                 using  multipart  uploads,  this  value  may  not be a direct
                 checksum value of the full object. Instead, it's  a  calcula-
                 tion  based  on  the checksum values of each individual part.
                 For more information about how checksums are calculated  with
                 multipart  uploads, see Checking object integrity in the Ama-
                 zon S3 User Guide .

              ChecksumSHA1 -> (string)
                 The base64-encoded, 160-bit SHA-1 digest of the object.  This
                 will only be present if it was uploaded with the object. When
                 you use the API operation on an object that was uploaded  us-
                 ing  multipart uploads, this value may not be a direct check-
                 sum value of the full object.  Instead,  it's  a  calculation
                 based  on  the  checksum  values of each individual part. For
                 more information about how checksums are calculated with mul-
                 tipart  uploads,  see Checking object integrity in the Amazon
                 S3 User Guide .

              ChecksumSHA256 -> (string)
                 This header can be used as a data integrity check  to  verify
                 that  the  data received is the same data that was originally
                 sent.  This  header  specifies  the  base64-encoded,  256-bit
                 SHA-256  digest  of  the  object.  For  more information, see
                 Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       Initiator -> (structure)
          Container element that identifies who initiated  the  multipart  up-
          load.  If the initiator is an Amazon Web Services account, this ele-
          ment provides the same information as the Owner element. If the ini-
          tiator  is  an IAM User, this element provides the user ARN and dis-
          play name.

          ID -> (string)
              If the principal is an Amazon Web Services account, it  provides
              the  Canonical User ID. If the principal is an IAM User, it pro-
              vides a user ARN value.

              NOTE:
                 Directory buckets - If the principal is an  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices  account,  it  provides the Amazon Web Services account
                 ID. If the principal is an IAM User, it provides a  user  ARN
                 value.

          DisplayName -> (string)
              Name of the Principal.

              NOTE:
                 This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       Owner -> (structure)
          Container element that identifies the object owner, after the object
          is created. If multipart upload is initiated by an  IAM  user,  this
          element provides the parent account ID and display name.

          NOTE:
              Directory  buckets  - The bucket owner is returned as the object
              owner for all the parts.

          DisplayName -> (string)
              Container for the display name of the owner. This value is  only
              supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:

              o US East (N. Virginia)

              o US West (N. California)

              o US West (Oregon)

              o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

              o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

              o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

              o Europe (Ireland)

              o South America (So Paulo)

              NOTE:
                 This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          ID -> (string)
              Container for the ID of the owner.

       StorageClass -> (string)
          The class of storage used to store the uploaded object.

          NOTE:
              Directory  buckets  - Only the S3 Express One Zone storage class
              is supported by directory buckets to store objects.

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       ChecksumAlgorithm -> (string)
          The algorithm that was used to create a checksum of the object.
