PUT-OBJECT-LOCK-CONFIGURATION()                PUT-OBJECT-LOCK-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-object-lock-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Places  an  Object Lock configuration on the specified bucket. The rule
       specified in the Object Lock configuration will be applied  by  default
       to  every  new object placed in the specified bucket. For more informa-
       tion, see Locking Objects .

       NOTE:

          o The DefaultRetention settings require both a mode and a period.

          o The DefaultRetention period can be either Days or  Years  but  you
            must  select  one.  You  cannot specify Days and Years at the same
            time.

          o You can only enable Object Lock for new buckets. If  you  want  to
            turn  on  Object  Lock  for an existing bucket, contact Amazon Web
            Services Support.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket whose Object Lock configuration you want to create or re-
          place.

       --object-lock-configuration (structure)
          The  Object  Lock configuration that you want to apply to the speci-
          fied bucket.

          ObjectLockEnabled -> (string)
              Indicates whether this bucket has an Object  Lock  configuration
              enabled.  Enable ObjectLockEnabled when you apply ObjectLockCon-
              figuration to a bucket.

          Rule -> (structure)
              Specifies the Object Lock rule for the specified object.  Enable
              the  this  rule  when  you  apply  ObjectLockConfiguration  to a
              bucket. Bucket settings require both a mode and  a  period.  The
              period  can be either Days or Years but you must select one. You
              cannot specify Days and Years at the same time.

              DefaultRetention -> (structure)
                 The default Object Lock retention mode and  period  that  you
                 want  to apply to new objects placed in the specified bucket.
                 Bucket settings require both a mode and a period. The  period
                 can be either Days or Years but you must select one. You can-
                 not specify Days and Years at the same time.

                 Mode -> (string)
                     The default Object Lock retention mode you want to  apply
                     to  new  objects  placed in the specified bucket. Must be
                     used with either Days or Years .

                 Days -> (integer)
                     The number of days that you want to specify for  the  de-
                     fault retention period. Must be used with Mode .

                 Years -> (integer)
                     The  number of years that you want to specify for the de-
                     fault retention period. Must be used with Mode .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ObjectLockEnabled=string,Rule={DefaultRetention={Mode=string,Days=integer,Years=integer}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled",
            "Rule": {
              "DefaultRetention": {
                "Mode": "GOVERNANCE"|"COMPLIANCE",
                "Days": integer,
                "Years": integer
              }
            }
          }

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. For information about  downloading  objects  from  Requester
          Pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --token (string)
          A token to allow Object Lock to be enabled for an existing bucket.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash for the request body.

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for  the  object
          when  using  the  SDK.  This  header will not provide any additional
          functionality if not using the SDK. When sending this header,  there
          must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header sent.
          Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code 400
          Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object integrity in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3  ignores  any  pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status  code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set an object lock configuration on a bucket

       The  following  put-object-lock-configuration example sets a 50-day ob-
       ject lock on the specified bucket.

          aws s3api put-object-lock-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket-with-object-lock \
              --object-lock-configuration '{ "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled", "Rule": { "DefaultRetention": { "Mode": "COMPLIANCE", "Days": 50 }}}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.
