DELETE-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()                          DELETE-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()



NAME
       delete-bucket-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       This  implementation of the DELETE action resets the default encryption
       for the bucket as server-side encryption with Amazon  S3  managed  keys
       (SSE-S3).

       NOTE:

          o General purpose buckets - For information about the bucket default
            encryption feature, see Amazon S3 Bucket Default Encryption in the
            Amazon S3 User Guide .

          o Directory buckets - For directory buckets, there are only two sup-
            ported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. For
            information  about  the default encryption configuration in direc-
            tory buckets, see Setting default server-side encryption  behavior
            for directory buckets .

          Permissions

       o General  purpose  bucket permissions - The s3:PutEncryptionConfigura-
         tion permission is required in a policy. The bucket  owner  has  this
         permission  by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to
         others. For more information about permissions, see  Permissions  Re-
         lated  to  Bucket  Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your
         Amazon S3 Resources .

       o Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation,
         you  must have the s3express:PutEncryptionConfiguration permission in
         an IAM identity-based policy instead of a  bucket  policy.  Cross-ac-
         count  access  to  this API operation isn't supported. This operation
         can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services  account  that  owns
         the  resource.  For  more information about directory bucket policies
         and permissions, see Amazon Web Services Identity and Access  Manage-
         ment (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

         HTTP Host header syntax
          Directory  buckets  -  The HTTP Host header syntax is s3express-con-
          trol.*region-code* .amazonaws.com .

       The following operations are related to DeleteBucketEncryption :

       o PutBucketEncryption

       o GetBucketEncryption

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket containing the server-side encryption config-
          uration to delete.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket,  you  must  use  path-style  requests  in   the   format
              https://s3express-control.*region-code*                 .amazon-
              aws.com/*bucket-name* `` . Virtual-hosted-style requests  aren't
              supported.  Directory  bucket names must be unique in the chosen
              Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names  must  also
              follow  the format `` *bucket-base-name* --*zone-id* --x-s3 (for
              example, `` DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --usw2-az1 --x-s3`` ). For infor-
              mation  about  bucket  naming restrictions, see Directory bucket
              naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

          NOTE:
              For directory buckets, this header is not supported in this  API
              operation.  If  you  specify this header, the request fails with
              the HTTP status code 501 Not Implemented .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete the server-side encryption configuration of a bucket

       The  following delete-bucket-encryption example deletes the server-side
       encryption configuration of the specified bucket.

          aws s3api delete-bucket-encryption \
              --bucket my-bucket

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
