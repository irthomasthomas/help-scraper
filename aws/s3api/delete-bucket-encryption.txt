DELETE-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()                          DELETE-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()



NAME
       delete-bucket-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       This  implementation of the DELETE action resets the default encryption
       for the bucket as server-side encryption with Amazon  S3  managed  keys
       (SSE-S3).  For information about the bucket default encryption feature,
       see Amazon S3 Bucket Default Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the  s3:Pu-
       tEncryptionConfiguration  action.  The bucket owner has this permission
       by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to  others.  For
       more  information  about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket
       Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to  your  Amazon
       S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket containing the server-side encryption config-
          uration to delete.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete the server-side encryption configuration of a bucket

       The following delete-bucket-encryption example deletes the  server-side
       encryption configuration of the specified bucket.

          aws s3api delete-bucket-encryption \
              --bucket my-bucket

       This command produces no output.
