DELETE-BUCKET-POLICY()                                  DELETE-BUCKET-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-bucket-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the policy of a specified bucket.

       NOTE:
              Directory  buckets  -  For  directory buckets, you must make re-
              quests for this API operation to the  Regional  endpoint.  These
              endpoints support path-style requests in the format
              ``
              https://s3express-control.*region_code*                 .amazon-
              aws.com/bucket-name `` .  Virtual-hosted-style  requests  aren't
              supported.  For  more  information,  see Regional and Zonal end-
              points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 26)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          Permissions

       If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web
       Services  account  that owns the bucket, the calling identity must both
       have the DeleteBucketPolicy permissions on the specified bucket and be-
       long to the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.

       If  you  don't have DeleteBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a
       403 Access Denied error. If  you  have  the  correct  permissions,  but
       you're  not  using  an  identity that belongs to the bucket owner's ac-
       count, Amazon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

       WARNING:
          To ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out
          of  their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's Amazon
          Web Services account can perform the GetBucketPolicy , PutBucketPol-
          icy  , and DeleteBucketPolicy API actions, even if their bucket pol-
          icy explicitly denies the root principal's access. Bucket owner root
          principals  can only be blocked from performing these API actions by
          VPC endpoint policies and Amazon Web  Services  Organizations  poli-
          cies.

       o General  purpose  bucket permissions - The s3:DeleteBucketPolicy per-
         mission is required in a policy. For more information  about  general
         purpose  buckets  bucket policies, see Using Bucket Policies and User
         Policies in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       o Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation,
         you  must  have the s3express:DeleteBucketPolicy permission in an IAM
         identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy.  Cross-account  ac-
         cess  to  this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only
         be performed by the Amazon Web Services account  that  owns  the  re-
         source. For more information about directory bucket policies and per-
         missions, see Amazon Web  Services  Identity  and  Access  Management
         (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

         HTTP Host header syntax
          Directory  buckets  -  The HTTP Host header syntax is s3express-con-
          trol.*region* .amazonaws.com .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket,   you   must  use  path-style  requests  in  the  format
              https://s3express-control.*region_code*                 .amazon-
              aws.com/*bucket-name*  `` . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't
              supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in  the  chosen
              Availability  Zone.  Bucket names must also follow the format ``
              *bucket_base_name* --*az_id* --x-s3 (for example,  ``  DOC-EXAM-
              PLE-BUCKET  --usw2-az1  --x-s3`` ). For information about bucket
              naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming  rules  in  the
              Amazon S3 User Guide

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

          NOTE:
              For  directory buckets, this header is not supported in this API
              operation. If you specify this header, the  request  fails  with
              the HTTP status code 501 Not Implemented .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
