PUT-OBJECT-RETENTION()                                  PUT-OBJECT-RETENTION()



NAME
       put-object-retention -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Places  an Object Retention configuration on an object. For more infor-
       mation, see Locking Objects . Users or accounts require  the  s3:PutOb-
       jectRetention permission in order to place an Object Retention configu-
       ration on objects. Bypassing a Governance Retention  configuration  re-
       quires the s3:BypassGovernanceRetention permission.

       This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  bucket name that contains the object you want to apply this Ob-
          ject Retention configuration to.
              Access points - When you use this action with an  access  point,
              you  must  provide the alias of the access point in place of the
              bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the  ac-
              cess  point  ARN,  you  must direct requests to the access point
              hostname. The access point hostname takes the form  AccessPoint-
              Name  -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com. When
              using this action with an access point through  the  Amazon  Web
              Services  SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the
              bucket name. For more information about access point  ARNs,  see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --key (string)
          The  key  name for the object that you want to apply this Object Re-
          tention configuration to.

       --retention (structure)
          The container element for the Object Retention configuration.

          Mode -> (string)
              Indicates the Retention mode for the specified object.

          RetainUntilDate -> (timestamp)
              The date on which this Object Lock Retention will expire.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Mode=string,RetainUntilDate=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Mode": "GOVERNANCE"|"COMPLIANCE",
            "RetainUntilDate": timestamp
          }

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has  Requester
          Pays  enabled,  the  requester will pay for corresponding charges to
          copy the object. For information about downloading objects from  Re-
          quester  Pays  buckets,  see  Downloading  Objects in Requester Pays
          Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --version-id (string)
          The version ID for the object that you want to apply this Object Re-
          tention configuration to.

       --bypass-governance-retention | --no-bypass-governance-retention (bool-
       ean)
          Indicates whether this action should bypass Governance-mode restric-
          tions.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash for the request body.

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates  the  algorithm used to create the checksum for the object
          when you use the SDK. This header will not  provide  any  additional
          functionality  if  you don't use the SDK. When you send this header,
          there must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header
          sent.  Otherwise,  Amazon  S3 fails the request with the HTTP status
          code 400 Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object in-
          tegrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If  you  provide  an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID  that
          you  provide  does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set an object retention configuration for an object

       The  following  put-object-retention  example  sets an object retention
       configuration for the specified object until 2025-01-01.

          aws s3api put-object-retention \
              --bucket my-bucket-with-object-lock \
              --key doc1.rtf \
              --retention '{ "Mode": "GOVERNANCE", "RetainUntilDate": "2025-01-01T00:00:00" }'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
