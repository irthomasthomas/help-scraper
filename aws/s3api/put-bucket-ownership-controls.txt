OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose OwnershipControls you want to
          set.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash of the OwnershipControls request body.

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --ownership-controls (structure)
          The OwnershipControls (BucketOwnerEnforced, BucketOwnerPreferred, or
          ObjectWriter) that you want to apply to this Amazon S3 bucket.

          Rules -> (list)
              The container element for an ownership control rule.

              (structure)
                 The container element for an ownership control rule.

                 ObjectOwnership -> (string)
                     The container element for object ownership for a bucket's
                     ownership controls.

                     BucketOwnerPreferred - Objects  uploaded  to  the  bucket
                     change  ownership  to the bucket owner if the objects are
                     uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL.

                     ObjectWriter - The uploading account will own the  object
                     if the object is uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-con-
                     trol canned ACL.

                     BucketOwnerEnforced - Access  control  lists  (ACLs)  are
                     disabled  and  no  longer  affect permissions. The bucket
                     owner automatically owns and has full control over  every
                     object  in  the  bucket.  The bucket only accepts PUT re-
                     quests that don't specify an ACL  or  bucket  owner  full
                     control   ACLs,  such  as  the  bucket-owner-full-control
                     canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in
                     the XML format.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Rules=[{ObjectOwnership=string},{ObjectOwnership=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Rules": [
              {
                "ObjectOwnership": "BucketOwnerPreferred"|"ObjectWriter"|"BucketOwnerEnforced"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
