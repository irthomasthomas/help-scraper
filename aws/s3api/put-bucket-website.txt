PUT-BUCKET-WEBSITE()                                      PUT-BUCKET-WEBSITE()



NAME
       put-bucket-website -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the configuration of the website that is specified in the website
       subresource. To configure a bucket as a website, you can add this  sub-
       resource  on  the bucket with website configuration information such as
       the file name of the index document and any redirect  rules.  For  more
       information, see Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 .

       This  PUT  action  requires  the S3:PutBucketWebsite permission. By de-
       fault, only the bucket owner can configure the website  attached  to  a
       bucket; however, bucket owners can allow other users to set the website
       configuration by writing a bucket policy that grants them  the  S3:Put-
       BucketWebsite permission.

       To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint,
       you add a website configuration with the  following  elements.  Because
       all requests are sent to another website, you don't need to provide in-
       dex document name for the bucket.

       o WebsiteConfiguration

       o RedirectAllRequestsTo

       o HostName

       o Protocol

       If you want granular control over redirects, you can use the  following
       elements  to add routing rules that describe conditions for redirecting
       requests and information about the redirect destination. In this  case,
       the  website  configuration  must  provide  an  index  document for the
       bucket, because some requests might not be redirected.

       o WebsiteConfiguration

       o IndexDocument

       o Suffix

       o ErrorDocument

       o Key

       o RoutingRules

       o RoutingRule

       o Condition

       o HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals

       o KeyPrefixEquals

       o Redirect

       o Protocol

       o HostName

       o ReplaceKeyPrefixWith

       o ReplaceKeyWith

       o HttpRedirectCode

       Amazon S3 has a limitation of 50 routing rules per  website  configura-
       tion. If you require more than 50 routing rules, you can use object re-
       direct. For more information, see Configuring an Object Redirect in the
       Amazon S3 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. You must use this
          header as a message integrity check to verify that the request  body
          was not corrupted in transit. For more information, see RFC 1864 .

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates  the  algorithm used to create the checksum for the object
          when using the SDK. This header  will  not  provide  any  additional
          functionality  if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there
          must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header sent.
          Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code 400
          Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object integrity in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If  you  provide  an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --website-configuration (structure)

                 tory on the website endpoint (for example,if  the  suffix  is
                 index.html and you make a request to samplebucket/images/ the
                 data that is returned will be for the  object  with  the  key
                 name images/index.html) The suffix must not be empty and must
                 not include a slash character.

                 Specifies  the  redirect  behavior and when a redirect is ap-
                 plied.  For  more  information  about  routing   rules,   see
                 Configuring  advanced  conditional redirects in the Amazon S3
                 User Guide .

                 Condition -> (structure)
                     A container for describing a condition that must  be  met
                     for  the  specified redirect to apply. For example, 1. If
                     request is for pages in the /docs folder, redirect to the
                     /documents  folder.  2.  If request results in HTTP error
                     4xx, redirect request to another  host  where  you  might
                     process the error.

                     HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals -> (string)
                        The  HTTP  error code when the redirect is applied. In

                        value,  then  the  specified  redirect is applied. Re-
                        quired when parent element Condition is specified  and
                        sibling  KeyPrefixEquals is not specified. If both are
                        specified, then both must be true for the redirect  to
                        be applied.

                     KeyPrefixEquals -> (string)
                        The  object  key  name prefix when the redirect is ap-
                        plied. For example, to  redirect  requests  for  Exam-
                        plePage.html , the key prefix will be ExamplePage.html
                        . To redirect request for all pages  with  the  prefix
                        docs/  ,  the key prefix will be /docs , which identi-
                        fies all objects in the docs/  folder.  Required  when
                        the  parent element Condition is specified and sibling
                        HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals is not specified. If  both
                        conditions  are  specified,  both must be true for the
                        redirect to be applied.

                        WARNING:
                            Replacement must be made for object keys  contain-
                            ing  special characters (such as carriage returns)
                            when using XML requests. For more information, see

                 Redirect -> (structure)
                     Container  for redirect information. You can redirect re-
                     quests to another host, to another page, or with  another
                     protocol.  In  the  event  of an error, you can specify a
                     different error code to return.

                     HostName -> (string)
                        The host name to use in the redirect request.

                     HttpRedirectCode -> (string)

                        quired if one of the siblings is present.

                     Protocol -> (string)
                        Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The default
                        is the protocol that is used in the original request.

                     ReplaceKeyPrefixWith -> (string)
                        The object key prefix to use in the redirect  request.
                        For  example,  to redirect requests for all pages with

                        ments/ , you can set a condition block with KeyPrefix-
                        Equals set to  docs/  and  in  the  Redirect  set  Re-
                        placeKeyPrefixWith to /documents . Not required if one
                        of the siblings is present. Can be present only if Re-

          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
