OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The general purpose bucket that contains the metadata table configu-
          ration that you want to retrieve.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  expected  owner  of the general purpose bucket that you want to
          retrieve the metadata table configuration from.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  the table bucket
                     that's specified as the destination in the metadata table
                     configuration.  The  destination  table bucket must be in

                     The  name  for  the metadata table in your metadata table
                     configuration. The specified metadata table name must  be

                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the metadata table  in
                     the  metadata table configuration. The specified metadata
                     table name must  be  unique  within  the  aws_s3_metadata
                     namespace in the destination table bucket.

                 TableNamespace -> (string)
                     The table bucket namespace for the metadata table in your
                     metadata  table  configuration.  This  value  is   always
                     aws_s3_metadata .

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the metadata table. The status values are:

              o CREATING  - The metadata table is in the process of being cre-
                ated in the specified table bucket.

              o ACTIVE - The metadata table has been created successfully  and
                records are being delivered to the table.

              o FAILED  - Amazon S3 is unable to create the metadata table, or
                Amazon S3 is unable to deliver records. See  ErrorDetails  for
                details.

          Error -> (structure)
              If  the CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration request succeeds,
              but S3 Metadata was unable to create the table,  this  structure
              contains the error code and error message.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 If  the  CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration  request suc-
                 ceeds, but S3 Metadata was unable to create the  table,  this
                 structure  contains  the error code. The possible error codes
                 and error messages are as follows:

                 o AccessDeniedCreatingResources - You don't  have  sufficient
                   permissions  to  create  the  required resources. Make sure
                   that  you  have  s3tables:CreateNamespace  ,  s3tables:Cre-
                   ateTable  ,  s3tables:GetTable  and s3tables:PutTablePolicy
                   permissions, and then try again. To create a  new  metadata
                   table,  you must delete the metadata configuration for this
                   bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.

                 o AccessDeniedWritingToTable - Unable to write to  the  meta-
                   data  table because of missing resource permissions. To fix
                   the resource policy, Amazon S3 needs to create a new  meta-
                   data table. To create a new metadata table, you must delete
                   the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create
                   a new metadata configuration.

                 o DestinationTableNotFound  -  The  destination table doesn't
                   exist. To create a new metadata table, you must delete  the
                   metadata  configuration  for this bucket, and then create a
                   new metadata configuration.

                 o ServerInternalError - An internal error  has  occurred.  To
                   create  a  new metadata table, you must delete the metadata
                   configuration for this bucket, and then create a new  meta-
                   data configuration.

                 o TableAlreadyExists  -  The table that you specified already
                   exists in the table bucket's namespace. Specify a different
                   table name. To create a new metadata table, you must delete
                   the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create
                   a new metadata configuration.

                 o TableBucketNotFound  -  The table bucket that you specified
                   doesn't exist in this Amazon Web Services  Region  and  ac-
                   count. Create or choose a different table bucket. To create
                   a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configu-
                   ration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata con-
                   figuration.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 If the  CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration  request  suc-
                 ceeds,  but  S3 Metadata was unable to create the table, this
                 structure contains the  error  message.  The  possible  error
