PUT-BUCKET-REPLICATION()                              PUT-BUCKET-REPLICATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-replication -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Creates  a  replication  configuration or replaces an existing one. For
       more information, see Replication in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       Specify the replication configuration  in  the  request  body.  In  the
       replication  configuration,  you  provide  the  name of the destination
       bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to  replicate  objects,  the
       IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf,
       and other relevant information. You can invoke this request for a  spe-
       cific  Amazon  Web  Services  Region by using the ` aws:RequestedRegion
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-requestedregion`__
       condition key.

       A  replication  configuration  must  include at least one rule, and can
       contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to
       replicate  by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose ad-
       ditional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.

       To specify a subset of the objects in the  source  bucket  to  apply  a
       replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule ele-
       ment. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more
       object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configura-
       tion, you must also add the following elements: DeleteMarkerReplication
       , Status , and Priority .

       NOTE:
          If  you  are  using an earlier version of the replication configura-
          tion, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete  markers  differently.
          For more information, see Backward Compatibility .

       For  information  about enabling versioning on a bucket, see Using Ver-
       sioning .
          Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects

       By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest
       using  server-side  encryption  with  KMS keys. To replicate Amazon Web
       Services KMS-encrypted objects, add the following:  SourceSelectionCri-
       teria , SseKmsEncryptedObjects , Status , EncryptionConfiguration , and
       ReplicaKmsKeyID . For information about replication configuration,  see
       Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using KMS keys .

       For  information  on  PutBucketReplication errors, see List of replica-
       tion-related error codes
          Permissions

       To create a PutBucketReplication request, you must have  s3:PutReplica-
       tionConfiguration permissions for the bucket.

       By  default, a resource owner, in this case the Amazon Web Services ac-
       count that created the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource
       owner  can  also grant others permissions to perform the operation. For
       more information about permissions, see  Specifying  Permissions  in  a
       Policy and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources .

       NOTE:
          To  perform  this  operation, the user or role performing the action
          must have the iam:PassRole permission.

       The following operations are related to PutBucketReplication :

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket

       --content-md5 (string)
          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. You must use this
          header  as a message integrity check to verify that the request body
          was not corrupted in transit. For more information, see RFC 1864 .

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for  the  object
          when  you  use  the SDK. This header will not provide any additional
          functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send  this  header,
          there must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header
          sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with  the  HTTP  status
          code 400 Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object in-
          tegrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3  ignores  any  pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --replication-configuration (structure)
          A  container  for  replication rules. You can add up to 1,000 rules.
          The maximum size of a replication configuration is 2 MB.

          Role -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and  Access  Man-
              agement  (IAM)  role that Amazon S3 assumes when replicating ob-
              jects. For more information, see How to Set  Up  Replication  in
              the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Rules -> (list)
              A  container  for  one  or more replication rules. A replication
              configuration must have at least one rule and can contain a max-
              imum of 1,000 rules.

              (structure)
                 Specifies  which  Amazon S3 objects to replicate and where to
                 store the replicas.

                 ID -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the rule. The  maximum  value  is
                     255 characters.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever
                     two or more replication rules conflict.  Amazon  S3  will
                     attempt to replicate objects according to all replication
                     rules. However, if there are two or more rules  with  the
                     same  destination bucket, then objects will be replicated
                     according to the rule  with  the  highest  priority.  The
                     higher the number, the higher the priority.

                     For  more  information,  see Replication in the Amazon S3
                     User Guide .

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     An object key name prefix that identifies the  object  or
                     objects  to  which  the  rule applies. The maximum prefix
                     length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects  in  a
                     bucket, specify an empty string.

                     WARNING:
                        Replacement  must  be  made for object keys containing
                        special characters (such as carriage returns) when us-
                        ing  XML  requests.  For more information, see XML re-
                        lated object key constraints .

                 Filter -> (structure)
                     A filter that identifies the subset of objects  to  which
                     the  replication  rule applies. A Filter must specify ex-
                     actly one Prefix , Tag , or an And child element.

                     Prefix -> (string)
                        An object key name prefix that identifies  the  subset
                        of objects to which the rule applies.

                        WARNING:
                            Replacement  must be made for object keys contain-
                            ing special characters (such as carriage  returns)
                            when using XML requests. For more information, see
                            XML related object key constraints .

                     Tag -> (structure)
                        A container for specifying a tag key and value.

                        The rule applies only to objects that have the tag  in
                        their tag set.

                        Key -> (string)
                            Name of the object key.

                        Value -> (string)
                            Value of the tag.

                     And -> (structure)
                        A  container  for specifying rule filters. The filters
                        determine the subset of objects to which the rule  ap-
                        plies.  This  element  is required only if you specify
                        more than one filter. For example:

                        o If you specify both a Prefix and a Tag filter,  wrap
                          these filters in an And tag.

                        o If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap
                          the Tag elements in an And tag.

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            An object key name prefix that identifies the sub-
                            set of objects to which the rule applies.

                        Tags -> (list)
                            An array of tags containing key and value pairs.

                            (structure)
                               A container of a key value name pair.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   Name of the object key.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   Value of the tag.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Specifies whether the rule is enabled.

                 SourceSelectionCriteria -> (structure)
                     A container that describes additional filters for identi-
                     fying the source objects that you want to replicate.  You
                     can  choose to enable or disable the replication of these
                     objects. Currently, Amazon S3 supports  only  the  filter
                     that you can specify for objects created with server-side
                     encryption using a customer managed key stored in  Amazon
                     Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).

                     SseKmsEncryptedObjects -> (structure)
                        A  container  for filter information for the selection
                        of Amazon S3 objects encrypted with  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                        vices  KMS.  If you include SourceSelectionCriteria in
                        the replication configuration,  this  element  is  re-
                        quired.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies  whether  Amazon  S3  replicates objects
                            created with server-side encryption using an  Ama-
                            zon Web Services KMS key stored in Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices Key Management Service.

                     ReplicaModifications -> (structure)
                        A filter that you can specify for selections for modi-
                        fications  on  replicas.  Amazon  S3 doesn't replicate
                        replica modifications by default. In the  latest  ver-
                        sion  of  replication  configuration  (when  Filter is
                        specified), you can specify this element and  set  the
                        status to Enabled to replicate modifications on repli-
                        cas.

                        NOTE:
                            If you don't specify the Filter element, Amazon S3
                            assumes  that the replication configuration is the
                            earlier version, V1. In the earlier version,  this
                            element is not allowed

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 replicates modifica-
                            tions on replicas.

                 ExistingObjectReplication -> (structure)
                     Optional  configuration  to  replicate  existing   source
                     bucket objects.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter  is  no longer supported. To replicate
                        existing objects,  see  Replicating  existing  objects
                        with  S3 Batch Replication in the Amazon S3 User Guide
                        .

                     Status -> (string)
                        Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates existing source
                        bucket objects.

                 Destination -> (structure)
                     A  container for information about the replication desti-
                     nation and its configurations including enabling  the  S3
                     Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).

                     Bucket -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket where you
                        want Amazon S3 to store the results.

                     Account -> (string)
                        Destination bucket owner account ID.  In  a  cross-ac-
                        count  scenario,  if  you  direct  Amazon S3 to change
                        replica ownership to the Amazon Web  Services  account
                        that owns the destination bucket by specifying the Ac-
                        cessControlTranslation property, this is  the  account
                        ID  of the destination bucket owner. For more informa-
                        tion, see Replication Additional Configuration: Chang-
                        ing the Replica Owner in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     StorageClass -> (string)
                        The  storage  class  to  use when replicating objects,
                        such as S3 Standard or reduced redundancy. By default,
                        Amazon  S3 uses the storage class of the source object
                        to create the object replica.

                        For valid values, see the StorageClass element of  the
                        PUT  Bucket  replication  action  in the Amazon S3 API
                        Reference .

                     AccessControlTranslation -> (structure)
                        Specify this only in a cross-account  scenario  (where
                        source  and  destination  bucket  owners  are  not the
                        same), and you want to change replica ownership to the
                        Amazon  Web Services account that owns the destination
                        bucket. If this is not specified  in  the  replication
                        configuration,  the  replicas are owned by same Amazon
                        Web Services account that owns the source object.

                        Owner -> (string)
                            Specifies the replica ownership. For  default  and
                            valid  values,  see  PUT bucket replication in the
                            Amazon S3 API Reference .

                     EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                        A container that provides  information  about  encryp-
                        tion.  If  SourceSelectionCriteria  is  specified, you
                        must specify this element.

                        ReplicaKmsKeyID -> (string)
                            Specifies the ID (Key ARN or  Alias  ARN)  of  the
                            customer  managed  Amazon  Web  Services  KMS  key
                            stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management  Ser-
                            vice  (KMS)  for the destination bucket. Amazon S3
                            uses this key to encrypt replica  objects.  Amazon
                            S3  only  supports  symmetric encryption KMS keys.
                            For more information, see Asymmetric keys in  Ama-
                            zon  Web  Services  KMS in the Amazon Web Services
                            Key Management Service Developer Guide .

                     ReplicationTime -> (structure)
                        A container specifying S3 Replication Time Control (S3
                        RTC), including whether S3 RTC is enabled and the time
                        when all objects and operations  on  objects  must  be
                        replicated.  Must be specified together with a Metrics
                        block.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies whether the replication time is enabled.

                        Time -> (structure)
                            A container specifying the time by which  replica-
                            tion should be complete for all objects and opera-
                            tions on objects.

                            Minutes -> (integer)
                               Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

                               Valid value: 15

                     Metrics -> (structure)
                        A  container  specifying  replication  metrics-related
                        settings enabling replication metrics and events.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Specifies  whether the replication metrics are en-
                            abled.

                        EventThreshold -> (structure)
                            A container  specifying  the  time  threshold  for
                            emitting the s3:Replication:OperationMissedThresh-
                            old event.

                            Minutes -> (integer)
                               Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

                               Valid value: 15

                 DeleteMarkerReplication -> (structure)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If
                     you  specify  a Filter in your replication configuration,
                     you must also include a DeleteMarkerReplication  element.
                     If  your Filter includes a Tag element, the DeleteMarker-
                     Replication  Status must be set to Disabled, because Ama-
                     zon  S3  does  not support replicating delete markers for
                     tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see  Basic
                     Rule Configuration .

                     For more information about delete marker replication, see
                     Basic Rule Configuration .

                     NOTE:
                        If you are using an earlier version of the replication
                        configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete
                        markers  differently.  For   more   information,   see
                        Backward Compatibility .

                     Status -> (string)
                        Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

                        NOTE:
                            Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

            ]
          }

       --token (string)
          A token to allow Object Lock to be enabled for an existing bucket.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To configure replication for an S3 bucket

       The following put-bucket-replication example applies a replication con-
       figuration to the specified S3 bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-replication \
              --bucket AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1 \
              --replication-configuration file://replication.json

       Contents of replication.json:

          {
              "Role": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/s3-replication-role",
              "Rules": [
                  {
                      "Status": "Enabled",
                      "Priority": 1,
                      "DeleteMarkerReplication": { "Status": "Disabled" },
                      "Filter" : { "Prefix": ""},
                      "Destination": {
                          "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET2"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       The destination bucket must have versioning enabled. The specified role
       must  have  permission  to  write  to the destination bucket and have a
       trust relationship that allows Amazon S3 to assume the role.

       Example role permission policy:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Action": [
                          "s3:GetReplicationConfiguration",
                          "s3:ListBucket"
                      ],
                      "Resource": [
                          "arn:aws:s3:::AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1"
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Action": [
                          "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                          "s3:GetObjectVersionAcl",
                          "s3:GetObjectVersionTagging"
                      ],
                      "Resource": [
                          "arn:aws:s3:::AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1/*"
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Action": [
                          "s3:ReplicateObject",
                          "s3:ReplicateDelete",
                          "s3:ReplicateTags"
                      ],
                      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET2/*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example trust relationship policy:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Principal": {
                          "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
                      },
                      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                  }
              ]
          }

       This command produces no output.
