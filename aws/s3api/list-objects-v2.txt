LIST-OBJECTS-V2()                                            LIST-OBJECTS-V2()



NAME
       list-objects-v2 -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket with each
       request. You can use the request parameters as  selection  criteria  to
       return  a subset of the objects in a bucket. A 200 OK response can con-
       tain valid or invalid XML. Make sure  to  design  your  application  to
       parse  the  contents  of  the response and handle it appropriately. For
       more information about listing objects, see Listing  object  keys  pro-
       grammatically in the Amazon S3 User Guide . To get a list of your buck-
       ets, see ListBuckets .

       NOTE:

          o General purpose bucket -  For  general  purpose  buckets,  ListOb-
            jectsV2   doesn't   return  prefixes  that  are  related  only  to
            in-progress multipart uploads.

          o Directory buckets - For directory buckets, ListObjectsV2  response
            includes  the prefixes that are related only to in-progress multi-
            part uploads.

          o Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make  requests
            for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints sup-
            port virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
            ``
            https://bucket_name    .s3express-az_id     .*region*     .amazon-
            aws.com/key-name  ``  . Path-style requests are not supported. For
            more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in  the  Amazon
            S3 User Guide .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 31)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          Permissions

       o General  purpose bucket permissions - To use this operation, you must
         have READ access to the bucket. You must have permission  to  perform
         the s3:ListBucket action. The bucket owner has this permission by de-
         fault and can grant this permission to others. For  more  information
         about  permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Op-
         erations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3  Resources
         in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       o Directory  bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation
         on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the `  CreateSession
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html`__
         API operation  for  session-based  authorization.  Specifically,  you
         grant  the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket
         in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy.  Then,  you  make
         the  CreateSession  API call on the bucket to obtain a session token.
         With the session token in your request header, you can make  API  re-
         quests  to  this operation. After the session token expires, you make
         another CreateSession API call to generate a new  session  token  for
         use.  Amazon  Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the
         session token automatically to avoid  service  interruptions  when  a
         session expires. For more information about authorization, see ` Cre-
         ateSession
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html`__
         .

         Sorting order of returned objects

       o General purpose bucket - For general purpose  buckets,  ListObjectsV2
         returns objects in lexicographical order based on their key names.

       o Directory  bucket - For directory buckets, ListObjectsV2 does not re-
         turn objects in lexicographical order.

         HTTP Host header syntax
          Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax  is  ``  Bucket_name
          .s3express-az_id .*region* .amazonaws.com`` .

       WARNING:
          This section describes the latest revision of this action. We recom-
          mend that you use this revised API operation for application  devel-
          opment.  For  backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support
          the prior version of this API operation, ListObjects .

       The following operations are related to ListObjectsV2 :

       o GetObject

       o PutObject

       o CreateBucket

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-objects-v2 is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Contents, CommonPrefixes

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
              Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory
              bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
              ``  Bucket_name  .s3express-az_id  .*region*  .amazonaws.com`` .
              Path-style requests are not supported.  Directory  bucket  names
              must  be  unique  in  the chosen Availability Zone. Bucket names
              must follow the format `` bucket_base_name --az-id --x-s3`` (for
              example, `` DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --usw2-az1 --x-s3`` ). For infor-
              mation about bucket naming restrictions,  see  Directory  bucket
              naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Access  points  - When you use this action with an access point,
              you must provide the alias of the access point in place  of  the
              bucket  name or specify the access point ARN. When using the ac-
              cess point ARN, you must direct requests  to  the  access  point
              hostname.  The access point hostname takes the form AccessPoint-
              Name -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When
              using  this  action  with an access point through the Amazon Web
              Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of  the
              bucket  name.  For more information about access point ARNs, see
              Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          NOTE:
                 Access points and Object Lambda access points  are  not  sup-
                 ported by directory buckets.

              S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts  hostname.
              The  S3  on  Outposts hostname takes the form `` AccessPointName
              -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` .
              When  you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon
              Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN  in
              place  of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Out-
              posts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the  Amazon  S3  User
              Guide .

       --delimiter (string)
          A delimiter is a character that you use to group keys.

          NOTE:

              o Directory  buckets - For directory buckets, / is the only sup-
                ported delimiter.

              o Directory buckets - When you query ListObjectsV2 with a delim-
                iter  during in-progress multipart uploads, the CommonPrefixes
                response parameter contains the prefixes that  are  associated
                with  the  in-progress multipart uploads. For more information
                about multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview in  the
                Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --encoding-type (string)
          Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the re-
          sponse. Responses are encoded only in UTF-8. An object key can  con-
          tain  any Unicode character. However, the XML 1.0 parser can't parse
          certain characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to
          10.  For  characters  that  aren't supported in XML 1.0, you can add
          this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the  re-
          sponse. For more information about characters to avoid in object key
          names, see Object key naming guidelines .

          NOTE:
              When using the URL encoding type, non-ASCII characters that  are
              used  in  an object's key name will be percent-encoded according
              to UTF-8 code values. For example, the  object  test_file(3).png
              will appear as test_file%283%29.png .

          Possible values:

          o url

       --prefix (string)
          Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.

          NOTE:
              Directory  buckets  -  For directory buckets, only prefixes that
              end in a delimiter (/ ) are supported.

       --fetch-owner | --no-fetch-owner (boolean)
          The owner field is not present in ListObjectsV2 by default.  If  you
          want to return the owner field with each key in the result, then set
          the FetchOwner field to true .

          NOTE:
              Directory buckets - For directory buckets, the bucket  owner  is
              returned as the object owner for all objects.

       --start-after (string)
          StartAfter is where you want Amazon S3 to start listing from. Amazon
          S3 starts listing after this specified key. StartAfter  can  be  any
          key in the bucket.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for
          the list objects request in V2 style. Bucket owners need not specify
          this parameter in their requests.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that
          you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket,  the  re-
          quest fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --optional-object-attributes (list)
          Specifies  the  optional  fields  that  you want returned in the re-
          sponse. Fields that you do not specify are not returned.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            RestoreStatus

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a list of objects in a bucket

       The  following  list-objects-v2 example lists the objects in the speci-
       fied bucket.

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Set to false if all of the results were returned.  Set  to  true  if
          more  keys are available to return. If the number of results exceeds
          that specified by MaxKeys , all of the  results  might  not  be  re-
          turned.

       Contents -> (list)
          Metadata about each object returned.

          (structure)
              An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key
                 to retrieve the object.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Creation date of the object.

              ETag -> (string)
                 The entity tag is a hash of the  object.  The  ETag  reflects
                 changes  only to the contents of an object, not its metadata.
                 The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object  data.
                 Whether  or  not  it is depends on how the object was created
                 and how it is encrypted as described below:

                 o Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy op-
                   eration, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Con-
                   sole, and are encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have  ETags
                   that are an MD5 digest of their object data.

                 o Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy op-
                   eration, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Con-
                   sole,  and  are  encrypted  by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags
                   that are not an MD5 digest of their object data.

                 o If an object is created by either the Multipart  Upload  or
                   Part Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regard-
                   less of the method of encryption. If an  object  is  larger
                   than 16 MB, the Amazon Web Services Management Console will
                   upload or copy that  object  as  a  Multipart  Upload,  and
                   therefore the ETag will not be an MD5 digest.

                 NOTE:
                     Directory  buckets  -  MD5  is not supported by directory
                     buckets.

              ChecksumAlgorithm -> (list)
                 The algorithm that was used to create a checksum of  the  ob-
                 ject.

                 (string)

              Size -> (long)
                 Size in bytes of the object

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The class of storage used to store the object.

                 NOTE:
                     Directory  buckets - Only the S3 Express One Zone storage
                     class is supported by directory buckets to store objects.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 The owner of the object

                 NOTE:
                     Directory buckets - The bucket owner is returned  as  the
                     object owner.

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container  for  the display name of the owner. This value
                     is only supported in the following  Amazon  Web  Services
                     Regions:

                     o US East (N. Virginia)

                     o US West (N. California)

                     o US West (Oregon)

                     o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

                     o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                     o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                     o Europe (Ireland)

                     o South America (So Paulo)

                     NOTE:
                        This  functionality  is  not  supported  for directory
                        buckets.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

              RestoreStatus -> (structure)
                 Specifies the restoration status of  an  object.  Objects  in
                 certain  storage  classes must be restored before they can be
                 retrieved. For more information about these  storage  classes
                 and  how  to  work  with  archived  objects, see Working with
                 archived objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     This functionality is not supported for  directory  buck-
                     ets.  Only  the S3 Express One Zone storage class is sup-
                     ported by directory buckets to store objects.

                 IsRestoreInProgress -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the object is currently being restored.
                     If  the object restoration is in progress, the header re-
                     turns the value TRUE . For example:
                        x-amz-optional-object-attributes:         IsRestoreIn-
                        Progress="true"

                     If  the  object restoration has completed, the header re-
                     turns the value FALSE . For example:
                        x-amz-optional-object-attributes:         IsRestoreIn-
                        Progress="false",                       RestoreExpiry-
                        Date="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"

                     If the object hasn't been restored, there  is  no  header
                     response.

                 RestoreExpiryDate -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates  when the restored copy will expire. This value
                     is populated only if the  object  has  already  been  re-
                     stored. For example:
                        x-amz-optional-object-attributes:         IsRestoreIn-
                        Progress="false",                       RestoreExpiry-
                        Date="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"

       Name -> (string)
          The bucket name.

       Prefix -> (string)
          Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

          NOTE:
              Directory  buckets  -  For directory buckets, only prefixes that
              end in a delimiter (/ ) are supported.

       Delimiter -> (string)
          Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and  the
          first  occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single re-
          sult element in the CommonPrefixes collection. These rolled-up  keys
          are  not  returned  elsewhere in the response. Each rolled-up result
          counts as only one return against the MaxKeys value.

          NOTE:
              Directory buckets - For directory buckets, / is  the  only  sup-
              ported delimiter.

       MaxKeys -> (integer)
          Sets  the  maximum  number  of keys returned in the response. By de-
          fault, the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response  might
          contain fewer keys but will never contain more.

       CommonPrefixes -> (list)
          All of the keys (up to 1,000) that share the same prefix are grouped
          together. When counting the total numbers of returns by this API op-
          eration, this group of keys is considered as one item.

          A  response  can contain CommonPrefixes only if you specify a delim-
          iter.
              CommonPrefixes contains all (if there are any) keys between Pre-
              fix  and the next occurrence of the string specified by a delim-
              iter.

              CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like  subdirectories  in  the
              directory specified by Prefix .

          For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/
          ) as in notes/summer/july , the common prefix is notes/summer/ . All
          of  the keys that roll up into a common prefix count as a single re-
          turn when calculating the number of returns.

          NOTE:

              o Directory buckets - For directory buckets, only prefixes  that
                end in a delimiter (/ ) are supported.

              o Directory buckets - When you query ListObjectsV2 with a delim-
                iter during in-progress multipart uploads, the  CommonPrefixes
                response  parameter  contains the prefixes that are associated
                with the in-progress multipart uploads. For  more  information
                about  multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview in the
                Amazon S3 User Guide .

          (structure)
              Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the
              next  occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. Common-
              Prefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in  the  direc-
              tory  specified  by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/
              and the delimiter is a slash (/) as  in  notes/summer/july,  the
              common prefix is notes/summer/.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Container for the specified common prefix.

       EncodingType -> (string)
          Encoding  type  used  by Amazon S3 to encode object key names in the
          XML response.

          If you specify the encoding-type request parameter,  Amazon  S3  in-
          cludes  this  element  in the response, and returns encoded key name
          values in the following response elements:
              Delimiter, Prefix, Key, and StartAfter .

       KeyCount -> (integer)
          KeyCount is the number of keys returned with this request.  KeyCount
          will always be less than or equal to the MaxKeys field. For example,
          if you ask for 50 keys, your result will include 50 keys or fewer.

       ContinuationToken -> (string)
          If ContinuationToken was sent with the request, it  is  included  in
          the response. You can use the returned ContinuationToken for pagina-
          tion of the list response. You can use  this  ContinuationToken  for
          pagination of the list results.

       NextContinuationToken -> (string)
          NextContinuationToken  is sent when isTruncated is true, which means
          there are more keys in the bucket that can be listed. The next  list
          requests to Amazon S3 can be continued with this NextContinuationTo-
          ken . NextContinuationToken is obfuscated and is not a real key

       StartAfter -> (string)
          If StartAfter was sent with the request, it is included in  the  re-
          sponse.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.

          NOTE:
              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
