OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the rescore execution plan that you want to get
          information on.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          The identifier of the rescore execution plan.

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rescore execution plan.

       Name -> (string)
          The name for the rescore execution plan.

       Description -> (string)
          The description for the rescore execution plan.

       CapacityUnits -> (structure)
          The capacity units set for the rescore execution plan. A capacity of
          zero  indicates that the rescore execution plan is using the default
          capacity. For more information on the  default  capacity  and  addi-
          tional capacity units, see Adjusting capacity .

          RescoreCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              The amount of extra capacity for your rescore execution plan.

              A  single  extra capacity unit for a rescore execution plan pro-
              vides 0.01 rescore requests per second. You can add up  to  1000
              extra capacity units.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The Unix timestamp of when the rescore execution plan was created.

       UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The  Unix  timestamp of when the rescore execution plan was last up-
          dated.

       Status -> (string)
          The current status of the rescore execution plan. When the value  is
          ACTIVE  , the rescore execution plan is ready for use. If the Status
          field value is FAILED , the ErrorMessage field  contains  a  message
          that explains why.

       ErrorMessage -> (string)
          When  the Status field value is FAILED , the ErrorMessage field con-
          tains a message that explains why.
