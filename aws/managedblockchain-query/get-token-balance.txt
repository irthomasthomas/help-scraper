OPTIONS
       --token-identifier (structure)
          The container for the identifier for the token, including the unique
          token ID and its blockchain network.

          network -> (string)
              The blockchain network of the token.

          contractAddress -> (string)
              This is the token's contract address.

          tokenId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the token.

              NOTE:
                 You must specify this container with btc for the  native  BTC
                 token,  and eth for the native ETH token. For all other token
                 types you must specify the tokenId in the 64 character  hexa-
                 decimal tokenid format.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          network=string,contractAddress=string,tokenId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "network": "ETHEREUM_MAINNET"|"BITCOIN_MAINNET"|"BITCOIN_TESTNET"|"ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_TESTNET",
            "contractAddress": "string",
            "tokenId": "string"
          }

       --owner-identifier (structure)
          The container for the identifier for the owner.

          address -> (string)
              The contract or wallet address for the owner.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          address=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "address": "string"
          }

       --at-blockchain-instant (structure)
          The  time for when the TokenBalance is requested or the current time
          if a time is not provided in the request.

          NOTE:
              This time will only be recorded up to the second.

          time -> (timestamp)
              The container of the Timestamp of the blockchain instant.

              NOTE:
                 This timestamp will only be recorded up to the second.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          time=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "time": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
