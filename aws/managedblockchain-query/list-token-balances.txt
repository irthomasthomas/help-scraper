LIST-TOKEN-BALANCES()                                    LIST-TOKEN-BALANCES()



NAME
       list-token-balances -

DESCRIPTION
       This action returns the following for a given blockchain network:

       o Lists  all  token balances owned by an address (either a contract ad-
         dress or a wallet address).

       o Lists all token balances for all tokens created by a contract.

       o Lists all token balances for a given token.

       NOTE:
          You must always specify the network property of the tokenFilter when
          using this operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-token-balances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: tokenBalances

OPTIONS
       --owner-filter (structure)
          The contract or wallet address on the blockchain network by which to
          filter  the  request.  You  must specify the address property of the
          ownerFilter when listing balances of tokens owned by the address.

          address -> (string)
              The contract or wallet address.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          address=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "address": "string"
          }

       --token-filter (structure)
          The contract address or a token identifier on the blockchain network
          by which to filter the request. You must specify the contractAddress
          property of this container when listing tokens minted by a contract.

          NOTE:
              You must always specify the network property of  this  container
              when using this operation.

          network -> (string)
              The blockchain network of the token.

          contractAddress -> (string)
              This is the address of the contract.

          tokenId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the token.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          network=string,contractAddress=string,tokenId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "network": "ETHEREUM_MAINNET"|"ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_TESTNET"|"BITCOIN_MAINNET"|"BITCOIN_TESTNET",
            "contractAddress": "string",
            "tokenId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                        Bitcoin, eth for Ether, etc. For all other token types
                        you must specify the tokenId in the 64 character hexa-
