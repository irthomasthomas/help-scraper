NAME
       billingconductor -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web  Services Billing Conductor is a fully managed service that
       you can use to customize a proforma version of your billing  data  each
       month,  to accurately show or chargeback your end customers. Amazon Web
       Services Billing Conductor doesn't change the way you're billed by Ama-
       zon  Web Services each month by design. Instead, it provides you with a
       mechanism to configure, generate, and display  rates  to  certain  cus-
       tomers over a given billing period. You can also analyze the difference
       between the rates you apply to your accounting  groupings  relative  to
       your  actual rates from Amazon Web Services. As a result of your Amazon
       Web Services Billing Conductor configuration,  the  payer  account  can
       also  see  the  custom  rate applied on the billing details page of the
       Amazon Web Services Billing console , or configure a cost and usage re-
       port per billing group.

       This  documentation  shows  how  you  can configure Amazon Web Services
       Billing Conductor using its API. For more information about  using  the
       Amazon  Web  Services  Billing Conductor user interface, see the Amazon
       Web Services Billing Conductor User Guide .
