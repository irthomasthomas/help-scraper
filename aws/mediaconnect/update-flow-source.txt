OPTIONS
       --decryption (structure) The type of encryption used on the content in-
       gested from this source. Allowable encryption  types:  static-key.Algo-
       rithm -> (string)
              The  type  of algorithm that is used for the encryption (such as
              aes128, aes192, or aes256).

          ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
              A 128-bit, 16-byte  hex  value  represented  by  a  32-character
              string, to be used with the key for encrypting content. This pa-
              rameter is not valid for static key encryption.

          DeviceId -> (string)
              The value of one of the devices that you  configured  with  your
              digital  rights management (DRM) platform key provider. This pa-
              rameter is required for SPEKE encryption and is  not  valid  for
              static key encryption.

          KeyType -> (string)
              The  type  of key that is used for the encryption. If no keyType
              is  provided,  the  service  will  use   the   default   setting
              (static-key).

          Region -> (string)
              The  AWS  Region that the API Gateway proxy endpoint was created
              in. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryption and  is  not
              valid for static key encryption.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              An  identifier  for the content. The service sends this value to
              the key server to identify the current endpoint. The resource ID
              is  also known as the content ID. This parameter is required for
              SPEKE encryption and is not valid for static key encryption.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the role that you created during setup (when you  set
              up AWS Elemental MediaConnect as a trusted entity).

          SecretArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the secret that you created in AWS Secrets Manager to
              store the encryption key. This parameter is required for  static
              key encryption and is not valid for SPEKE encryption.

          Url -> (string)
              The  URL  from  the API Gateway proxy that you set up to talk to
              your key server. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryption
              and is not valid for static key encryption.

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
