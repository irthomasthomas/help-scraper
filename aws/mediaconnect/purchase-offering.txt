OPTIONS
       --offering-arn (string) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the offering.

       --reservation-name (string) The name that  you  want  to  use  for  the
       reservation.

       --start (string) The date and time that you want the reservation to be-
       gin, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You can specify any date  and
       time  between 12:00am on the first day of the current month to the cur-
       rent time on today's date, inclusive. Specify the start  in  a  24-hour
       notation. Use the following format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:SSZ, where T and Z
       are literal characters. For example, to specify  11:30pm  on  March  5,
       2020, enter 2020-03-05T23:30:00Z.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

          to outbound bandwidth for all flows from your account until your ac-
          count reaches the amount of bandwidth in your  reservation.  If  you
          use  more outbound bandwidth than the agreed upon amount in a single

              The  cost  of  a  single  unit.  This value, in combination with
              priceUnits, makes up the rate. MediaConnect defines  this  value
              in the offering.

          PriceUnits -> (string)

              A  definition of the amount of outbound bandwidth that you would
              be reserving if you purchase the offering. MediaConnect  defines
              the  values that make up the resourceSpecification in the offer-
