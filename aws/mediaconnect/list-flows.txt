LIST-FLOWS()                                                      LIST-FLOWS()



NAME
       list-flows -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  a  list  of flows that are associated with this account. This
       request returns a paginated result.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-flows is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Flows

SYNOPSIS
            list-flows
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              Provides  a  summary  of a flow, including its ARN, Availability
              Zone, and source type.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone that the flow was created in.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 The type of source. This value is  either  owned  (originated
                 somewhere other than an AWS Elemental MediaConnect flow owned
                 by another AWS account) or entitled (originated at an AWS El-
                 emental MediaConnect flow owned by another AWS account).

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the flow.

              Maintenance -> (structure)
                 The maintenance setting of a flow

                 MaintenanceDay -> (string)

                     Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday.

                 MaintenanceDeadline -> (string)
                     The Maintenance has to be performed before this  deadline
                     in ISO UTC format. Example: 2021-01-30T08:30:00Z.

                 MaintenanceScheduledDate -> (string)

                 MaintenanceStartHour -> (string)
                     UTC time when the maintenance will  happen.  Use  24-hour
                     HH:MM format. Minutes must be 00. Example: 13:00. The de-

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that identifies which batch of results that  you  want  to
          see. For example, you submit a ListFlows request with MaxResults set
          at 5. The service returns the first batch of results (up to 5) and a
          NextToken  value.  To  see the next batch of results, you can submit
          the ListFlows request a second time and specify the NextToken value.
