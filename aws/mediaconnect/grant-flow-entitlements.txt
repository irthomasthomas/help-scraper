OPTIONS
       --entitlements  (list)  The  list  of  entitlements  that  you  want to
       grant.(structure)
          The entitlements that you want to grant on a flow.

          DataTransferSubscriberFeePercent -> (integer)
              Percentage from 0-100 of the data transfer cost to be billed  to
              the subscriber.

          Description -> (string)
              A  description of the entitlement. This description appears only
              on the AWS Elemental MediaConnect console and will not  be  seen
              by the subscriber or end user.

          Encryption -> (structure)
              The  type  of encryption that will be used on the output that is
              associated with this entitlement.  Allowable  encryption  types:
              static-key, speke.

              Algorithm -> (string)
                 The  type  of algorithm that is used for the encryption (such
                 as aes128, aes192, or aes256).

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 A 128-bit, 16-byte hex value represented  by  a  32-character
                 string,  to be used with the key for encrypting content. This
                 parameter is not valid for static key encryption.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The value of one of the devices that you configured with your
                 digital  rights  management (DRM) platform key provider. This
                 parameter is required for SPEKE encryption and is  not  valid
                 for static key encryption.

              KeyType -> (string)
                 The  type  of key that is used for the encryption. If no key-
                 Type is provided, the service will use  the  default  setting
                 (static-key).

              Region -> (string)
                 The  AWS  Region that the API Gateway proxy endpoint was cre-
                 ated in. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryption  and
                 is not valid for static key encryption.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 An  identifier  for the content. The service sends this value
                 to the key server to identify the current endpoint.  The  re-
                 source  ID is also known as the content ID. This parameter is
                 required for SPEKE encryption and is not valid for static key
                 encryption.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the role that you created during setup (when you
                 set up AWS Elemental MediaConnect as a trusted entity).

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the secret that you created in AWS Secrets Manager
                 to  store  the encryption key. This parameter is required for
                 static key encryption and is not valid for SPEKE encryption.

              Url -> (string)
                 The URL from the API Gateway proxy that you set up to talk to
                 your key server. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryp-
                 tion and is not valid for static key encryption.

          EntitlementStatus -> (string)
              An indication of whether the new entitlement should  be  enabled
              or  disabled  as  soon as it is created. If you dont specify the
              entitlementStatus field in your request, MediaConnect sets it to
              ENABLED.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  of  the entitlement. This value must be unique within
              the current flow.

          Subscribers -> (list)
              The AWS account IDs that you want to share  your  content  with.
              The  receiving  accounts (subscribers) will be allowed to create
              their own flows using your content as the source.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DataTransferSubscriberFeePercent=integer,Description=string,Encryption={Algorithm=string,ConstantInitializationVector=string,DeviceId=string,KeyType=string,Region=string,ResourceId=string,RoleArn=string,SecretArn=string,Url=string},EntitlementStatus=string,Name=string,Subscribers=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DataTransferSubscriberFeePercent": integer,
              "Description": "string",
              "Encryption": {
                "Algorithm": "aes128"|"aes192"|"aes256",
                "ConstantInitializationVector": "string",
                "DeviceId": "string",
                "KeyType": "speke"|"static-key"|"srt-password",
                "Region": "string",
                "ResourceId": "string",
                "RoleArn": "string",
                "SecretArn": "string",
                "Url": "string"
              },

              "Subscribers": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --flow-arn (string) The flow that you want to grant entitlements on.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To grant an entitlement on a flow

       The  following grant-flow-entitlements example grants an entitlement to
       the specified existing flow to share your content with another AWS  ac-
       count.
