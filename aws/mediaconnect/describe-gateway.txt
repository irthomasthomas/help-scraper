OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  gateway
       that you want to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          EgressCidrBlocks -> (list)
              The range of IP addresses that contribute  content  or  initiate
              output requests for flows communicating with this gateway. These
              IP addresses should be in the form of a  Classless  Inter-Domain
              Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16.

              (string)

          GatewayArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway.

          GatewayMessages -> (list)
              (structure)
                 Code -> (string)
                     The error code.

                 Message -> (string)
                     The  specific  error message that MediaConnect returns to
                     help you understand the reason that the request  did  not
                     succeed.

                 ResourceName -> (string)
                     The name of the resource.

          GatewayState -> (string)
              The current status of the gateway.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the gateway. This name can not be modified after the
              gateway is created.

          Networks -> (list)
              The list of networks in the gateway.

              (structure)
                 The network settings for a gateway.

                 CidrBlock -> (string)
                     A unique IP address range to use for this network.  These
                     IP  addresses  should  be  in the form of a Classless In-
                     ter-Domain   Routing   (CIDR)   block;    for    example,
                     10.0.0.0/16.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  name  of the network. This name is used to reference
                     the network and must be unique  among  networks  in  this
                     gateway.
