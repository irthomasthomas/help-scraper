NAME
       ivs-realtime -

DESCRIPTION
          Introduction

       The  Amazon  Interactive Video Service (IVS) real-time API is REST com-
       patible, using a standard HTTP API and an AWS EventBridge event  stream
       for  responses. JSON is used for both requests and responses, including
       errors.

       Terminology:

       o A stage is a virtual space where participants can exchange  video  in
         real time.

       o A  participant token is a token that authenticates a participant when
         they join a stage.

       o A participant object represents participants (people)  in  the  stage
         and  contains information about them. When a token is created, it in-
         cludes a participant ID; when a participant uses that token to join a
         stage,  the  participant is associated with that participant ID There
         is a 1:1 mapping between participant tokens and participants.
          Resources

       The following resources contain information about your IVS live  stream
       (see Getting Started with Amazon IVS Real-Time Streaming ):

       o Stage   A  stage  is  a virtual space where participants can exchange
         video in real time.
          Tagging

       A tag is a metadata label that you assign to an  AWS  resource.  A  tag
       comprises  a  key and a value , both set by you. For example, you might
       set a tag as topic:nature to label a  particular  video  category.  See
       Tagging AWS Resources for more information, including restrictions that
       apply to tags and "Tag naming  limits  and  requirements";  Amazon  IVS
       stages  has  no  service-specific constraints beyond what is documented
       there.

       Tags can help you identify and organize your AWS resources.  For  exam-
       ple,  you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that
       they are related. You can also use tags to manage  access  (see  Access
       Tags ).

       The  Amazon  IVS real-time API has these tag-related endpoints:  TagRe-
       source ,  UntagResource , and  ListTagsForResource . The following  re-
       source supports tagging: Stage.

       At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.
          Stages Endpoints

       o CreateParticipantToken   Creates  an additional token for a specified
         stage. This can be done after stage creation or when tokens expire.

       o CreateStage  Creates a new stage (and optionally participant tokens).

       o DeleteStage  Shuts down and deletes the specified stage  (disconnect-
         ing all participants).

       o DisconnectParticipant   Disconnects  a  specified participant and re-
         vokes the participant permanently from a specified stage.

       o GetParticipant  Gets information about the specified participant  to-
         ken.

       o GetStage  Gets information for the specified stage.

       o GetStageSession  Gets information for the specified stage session.

       o ListParticipantEvents   Lists events for a specified participant that
         occurred during a specified stage session.

       o ListParticipants  Lists all participants in a  specified  stage  ses-
         sion.

       o ListStages   Gets  summary  information  about all stages in your ac-
         count, in the AWS region where the API request is processed.

       o ListStageSessions  Gets all sessions for a specified stage.

       o UpdateStage  Updates a stages configuration.
          Tags Endpoints

       o ListTagsForResource  Gets information about AWS tags for  the  speci-
         fied ARN.

       o TagResource  Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the spec-
         ified ARN.

       o UntagResource  Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN.
