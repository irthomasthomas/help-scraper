DESCRIPTION
          Introduction

       The  Amazon  Interactive Video Service (IVS) stage API is REST compati-
       ble, using a standard HTTP API and an AWS EventBridge event stream  for
       responses.  JSON is used for both requests and responses, including er-
       rors.

       Terminology: The IVS stage API sometimes is referred to as the IVS  Re-
       alTime API.
          Resources

       The  following resources contain information about your IVS live stream
       (see Getting Started with Amazon IVS ):

       o Stage  A stage is a virtual space where multiple participants can ex-
         change audio and video in real time.
          Tagging

       A  tag  is  a  metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag
       comprises a key and a value , both set by you. For example,  you  might
       set  a  tag  as  topic:nature to label a particular video category. See
       Tagging AWS Resources for more information, including restrictions that
       apply  to  tags  and  "Tag  naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS
       stages has no service-specific constraints beyond  what  is  documented
       there.

       Tags  can  help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For exam-
       ple, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate  that
       they  are  related.  You can also use tags to manage access (see Access
       Tags ).

       The Amazon IVS stage API has these tag-related endpoints:   TagResource
       ,   UntagResource  ,  and  ListTagsForResource . The following resource
       supports tagging: Stage.

       At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.
          Stages Endpoints

       o CreateParticipantToken  Creates an additional token for  a  specified
         stage. This can be done after stage creation or when tokens expire.

       o CreateStage  Creates a new stage (and optionally participant tokens).

       o DeleteStage   Shuts down and deletes the specified stage (disconnect-
         ing all participants).

       o DisconnectParticipant  Disconnects a specified  participant  and  re-
         vokes the participant permanently from a specified stage.

       o GetStage  Gets information for the specified stage.

       o ListStages   Gets  summary  information  about all stages in your ac-
         count, in the AWS region where the API request is processed.

       o UpdateStage  Updates a stages configuration.
          Tags Endpoints

       o ListTagsForResource  Gets information about AWS tags for  the  speci-
         fied ARN.

       o TagResource  Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the spec-
         ified ARN.

       o UntagResource  Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN.
