LIST-TIMELINE-EVENTS()                                  LIST-TIMELINE-EVENTS()



NAME
       list-timeline-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists timeline events for the specified incident record.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-timeline-events  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: eventSummaries

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters the timeline events based on the provided  conditional  val-
          ues. You can filter timeline events using the following keys:

          o eventTime

          o eventType

          Note the following when deciding how to use Filters:

          o If  you don't specify a Filter, the response includes all timeline
            events.

          o If you specify more than one filter in a single request,  the  re-
            sponse returns timeline events that match all filters.

          o If you specify a filter with more than one value, the response re-
            turns timeline events that match any of the values provided.

          (structure)
              Filter the selection by using a condition.

              condition -> (structure)
                 The condition accepts before or after a specified time, equal
                 to a string, or equal to an integer.

                 after -> (timestamp)
                     After the specified timestamp.

                 before -> (timestamp)
                     Before the specified timestamp

                 equals -> (structure)
                     The value is equal to the provided string or integer.

                     integerValues -> (list)
                        The list of integer values that the filter matches.

                        (integer)

                     stringValues -> (list)
                        The list of string values that the filter matches.

                        (string)

              key -> (string)
                 The key that you're filtering on.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "condition": {
                "after": timestamp,
                "before": timestamp,
                "equals": {
                  "integerValues": [integer, ...],
                  "stringValues": ["string", ...]
                }
              },
              "key": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --incident-record-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the incident that includes the
          timeline event.

       --sort-by (string)
          Sort by the specified key value pair.

          Possible values:

          o EVENT_TIME

       --sort-order (string)
          Sorts the order of timeline events by the  value  specified  in  the
          sortBy field.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list timeline events of an incident

       The following command-name example lists the  timeline  events  of  the
       specified incident.
