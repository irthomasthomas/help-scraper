SYNOPSIS
            get-response-plan
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the response plan.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          (string)

       incidentTemplate -> (structure)
          Details used to create the incident when using this response plan.

          dedupeString -> (string)
              The string Incident Manager uses to prevent the same root  cause
              from creating multiple incidents in the same account.

              A  deduplication  string  is a term or phrase the system uses to
              check for duplicate incidents. If you  specify  a  deduplication
              string,  Incident  Manager searches for open incidents that con-
              tain the same string in the dedupeString field when  it  creates
              the incident. If a duplicate is detected, Incident Manager dedu-
              plicates the newer incident into the existing incident.

              NOTE:
                 By default, Incident Manager automatically deduplicates  mul-
                 tiple  incidents  created by the same Amazon CloudWatch alarm
                 or Amazon EventBridge event. You don't have to enter your own
                 deduplication  string  to  prevent  duplication for these re-
                 source types.

          impact -> (integer)
              The impact of the incident on your customers and applications.
                 Supported impact codes

              o 1 - Critical

              o 2 - High

              o 3 - Medium

              o 4 - Low

              o 5 - No Impact

          incidentTags -> (map)
              Tags to assign to the template. When the StartIncident  API  ac-
              tion  is  called, Incident Manager assigns the tags specified in
              the template to the incident.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          notificationTargets -> (list)
              The Amazon SNS targets that are notified when updates  are  made
              to an incident.

              (tagged union structure)
                 The SNS targets that are notified when updates are made to an
                 incident.

                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
