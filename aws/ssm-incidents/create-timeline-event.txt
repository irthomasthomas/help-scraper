CREATE-TIMELINE-EVENT()                                CREATE-TIMELINE-EVENT()



NAME
       create-timeline-event -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a custom timeline event on the incident details page of an in-
       cident record. Incident Manager automatically creates  timeline  events
       that  mark  key moments during an incident. You can create custom time-
       line events to mark important events that Incident Manager  can  detect
       automatically.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  token  that ensures that a client calls the action only once with
          the specified details.

       --event-data (string)
          A short description of the event.

       --event-references (list)
          Adds one or more references to the TimelineEvent . A reference is an
          Amazon  Web  Services resource involved or associated with the inci-
          dent. To specify a reference, enter its Amazon Resource Name  (ARN).
          You  can also specify a related item associated with a resource. For
          example, to specify an Amazon DynamoDB (DynamoDB)  table  as  a  re-
          source,  use  the table's ARN. You can also specify an Amazon Cloud-
          Watch metric associated with the DynamoDB table as a related item.

          (tagged union structure)
              An item referenced in a TimelineEvent that  is  involved  in  or
              somehow  associated  with an incident. You can specify an Amazon
              Resource Name (ARN) for an Amazon Web Services resource or a Re-
              latedItem ID.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following
                 top level keys can be set: relatedItemId, resource.

              relatedItemId -> (string)
                 The ID of a RelatedItem referenced in a TimelineEvent .

              resource -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services  re-
                 source referenced in a TimelineEvent .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          relatedItemId=string,resource=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "relatedItemId": "string",
              "resource": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --event-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp for when the event occurred.

       --event-type (string)
          The  type  of  event.  You can create timeline events of type Custom
          Event and Note .

          To make a Note-type event appear on the Incident notes panel in  the
          console,  specify  eventType  as  Note and enter the Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN) of the incident as the value for eventReference .

       --incident-record-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the incident record that  the  ac-
          tion adds the incident to.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a custom timeline event

       The following create-timeline-event example creates a  custom  timeline
       event at the specified time on the specified incident.

          aws ssm-incidents create-timeline-event \
              --event-data "\"example timeline event\"" \
              --event-time 2022-10-01T20:30:00.000 \
              --event-type "Custom Event" \
              --incident-record-arn "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:incident-record/Example-Response-Plan/6ebcc812-85f5-b7eb-8b2f-283e4EXAMPLE"

       Output:

          {
              "eventId": "c0bcc885-a41d-eb01-b4ab-9d2deEXAMPLE",
              "incidentRecordArn": "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:incident-record/Example-Response-Plan/6ebcc812-85f5-b7eb-8b2f-283e4EXAMPLE"
          }

       Example 2: To create a timeline event with an incident note

       The  following  create-timeline-event  example creates a timeline event
       that is listed in the 'Incident notes' panel.

          aws ssm-incidents create-timeline-event \
               --event-data "\"New Note\"" \
               --event-type "Note" \
               --incident-record-arn "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:incident-record/Test/6cc46130-ca6c-3b38-68f1-f6abeEXAMPLE" \
               --event-time 2023-06-20T12:06:00.000 \
               --event-references '[{"resource":"arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:incident-record/Test/6cc46130-ca6c-3b38-68f1-f6abeEXAMPLE"}]'

       Output:

          {
              "eventId": "a41dc885-c0bc-b4ab-eb01-de9d2EXAMPLE",

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       eventId -> (string)
          The ID of the event for easy reference later.
