CREATE-TIMELINE-EVENT()                                CREATE-TIMELINE-EVENT()



NAME
       create-timeline-event -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a custom timeline event on the incident details page of an in-
       cident record. Timeline events are automatically  created  by  Incident
       Manager,  marking  key moment during an incident. You can create custom
       timeline events to mark important events  that  are  automatically  de-
       tected by Incident Manager.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A token ensuring that the action is called only once with the speci-
          fied details.

       --event-data (string)
          A short description of the event.

       --event-references (list)
          Adds one or more references to the TimelineEvent . A  reference  can
          be  an  Amazon  Web Services resource involved in the incident or in
          some way associated with it. When you specify a reference, you enter
          the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. You can also specify
          a related item. As an example, you could specify the ARN of an  Ama-
          zon DynamoDB (DynamoDB) table. The table for this example is the re-
          source. You could also specify a Amazon CloudWatch metric  for  that
          table. The metric is the related item.

          (tagged union structure)
              An  item  referenced  in  a TimelineEvent that is involved in or
              somehow associated with an incident. You can specify  an  Amazon
              Resource Name (ARN) for an Amazon Web Services resource or a Re-
              latedItem ID.

              NOTE:
                 This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the  following
                 top level keys can be set: relatedItemId, resource.

              relatedItemId -> (string)
                 The ID of a RelatedItem referenced in a TimelineEvent .

              resource -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services re-
                 source referenced in a TimelineEvent .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          relatedItemId=string,resource=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "relatedItemId": "string",
              "resource": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --event-time (timestamp)
          The time that the event occurred.

       --event-type (string)
          The type of the event. You can create timeline events of type Custom
          Event .

       --incident-record-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the incident record to which the
          event will be added.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a timeline event

       The following create-timeline-event example creates a  custom  timeline
       event at the specified time on the specified incident.

          aws ssm-incidents create-timeline-event \
              --event-data "\"example timeline event\"" \
              --event-time 2020-10-01T20:30:00.000 \
              --event-type "Custom Event" \
              --incident-record-arn "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:incident-record/Example-Response-Plan/6ebcc812-85f5-b7eb-8b2f-283e4d844308"

       Output:

          {
              "eventId": "c0bcc885-a41d-eb01-b4ab-9d2de193643c",
              "incidentRecordArn": "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:incident-record/Example-Response-Plan/6ebcc812-85f5-b7eb-8b2f-283e4d844308"
          }

       For more information, see Incident details in the Incident Manager User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       eventId -> (string)
          The ID of the event for easy reference later.

       incidentRecordArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the incident record that you added the event to.
