OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A token ensuring that the operation is called  only  once  with  the
          specified details.

       --impact (integer)
          Defines  the impact to the customers. Providing an impact overwrites
          the impact provided by a response plan.
              Possible impacts:

          o 1 - Critical impact, this typically relates  to  full  application
            failure that impacts many to all customers.

          o 2  -  High impact, partial application failure with impact to many
            customers.

          o 3 - Medium impact, the application is providing reduced service to
            customers.

          o 4 - Low impact, customer might aren't impacted by the problem yet.

          o 5  - No impact, customers aren't currently impacted but urgent ac-
            tion is needed to avoid impact.

       --related-items (list)
          Add related items to the incident for other responders to  use.  Re-
          lated  items are AWS resources, external links, or files uploaded to
          an Amazon S3 bucket.

          (structure)
              Resources that responders use to triage and mitigate  the  inci-
              dent.

              identifier -> (structure)
                 Details about the related item.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of related item.

                 value -> (tagged union structure)
                     Details about the related item.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing top level keys can be set:  arn,  metricDefini-
                        tion, url.

                     arn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the related item, if
                        the related item is an Amazon resource.

                     metricDefinition -> (string)
                        The metric definition, if the related item is a metric
                        in Amazon CloudWatch.

                     url -> (string)
                        The  URL, if the related item is a non-Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices resource.

              title -> (string)
                 The title of the related item.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          identifier={type=string,value={arn=string,metricDefinition=string,url=string}},title=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "identifier": {
                "type": "ANALYSIS"|"INCIDENT"|"METRIC"|"PARENT"|"ATTACHMENT"|"OTHER"|"AUTOMATION"|"INVOLVED_RESOURCE",
                "value": {
                  "arn": "string",
                  "metricDefinition": "string",
                  "url": "string"
                }
              },
              "title": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --response-plan-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the response plan that pre-defines
          summary,  chat channels, Amazon SNS topics, runbooks, title, and im-
          pact of the incident.

       --title (string)
          Provide a title for the incident. Providing a title  overwrites  the
          title provided by the response plan.

       --trigger-details (structure)
          Details of what created the incident record in Incident Manager.

          rawData -> (string)
              Raw  data  passed  from either Amazon EventBridge, Amazon Cloud-
              Watch, or Incident Manager when an incident is created.

          source -> (string)
              Identifies the  service  that  sourced  the  event.  All  events
              sourced  from within Amazon Web Services begin with "aws. " Cus-
              tomer-generated events can have any value here, as  long  as  it
              doesn't  begin  with  "aws. " We recommend the use of Java pack-
              age-name style reverse domain-name strings.

          timestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time that the incident was detected.

          triggerArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source that  detected  the
              incident.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          rawData=string,source=string,timestamp=timestamp,triggerArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "rawData": "string",
            "source": "string",
            "timestamp": timestamp,
            "triggerArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start an incident

       The following start-incident example starts an incident using the spec-
       ified response plan.

          aws ssm-incidents start-incident \
              --response-plan-arn "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:response-plan/Example-Response-Plan"

          {
              "incidentRecordArn": "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::682428703967:incident-record/Example-Response-Plan/6ebcc812-85f5-b7eb-8b2f-283e4d844308"
          }
