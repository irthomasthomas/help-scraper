NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Update  deletion protection to either allow or deny deletion of the fi-
       nal Region in a replication set.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-deletion-protection
          --arn <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          --deletion-protected | --no-deletion-protected
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication set you're  updat-
          ing.

       --client-token (string)
          A  token  ensuring  that  the operation is called only once with the
          specified details.

       --deletion-protected | --no-deletion-protected (boolean)
          Details if deletion protection is enabled or disabled  in  your  ac-
          count.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update replication set deletion protection

       The  following  update-deletion-protection example updates the deletion
       protection in your account to protect you from deleting the last Region
       in your replication set.

          aws ssm-incidents update-deletion-protection \
              --arn "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:replication-set/a2bcc5c9-0f53-8047-7fef-c20749989b40" \
              --deletion-protected

       This command produces no output.

       the Incident Manager User Guide.
