GET-RELATIONAL-DATABASE-EVENTS()              GET-RELATIONAL-DATABASE-EVENTS()



NAME
       get-relational-database-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of events for a specific database in Amazon Lightsail.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-relational-database-events  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: relationalDatabaseEvents

SYNOPSIS
            get-relational-database-events
          --relational-database-name <value>
          [--duration-in-minutes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --relational-database-name (string)
          The name of the database from which to get events.

       --duration-in-minutes (integer)
          The number of minutes in the past from which to retrieve events. For
          example, to get all events from the past 2 hours, enter 120.

          Default: 60

          The minimum is 1 and the maximum is 14 days (20160 minutes).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the events for a relational database

       The  following  get-relational-database-events example displays details
       about events in the last 17 hours (1020 minutes) for the specified  re-
       lational database.

          aws lightsail get-relational-database-events \
              --relational-database-name Database-1 \
              --duration-in-minutes 1020

       Output:

          {
              "relationalDatabaseEvents": [
                  {
                      "resource": "Database-1",
                      "createdAt": 1571654146.553,
                      "message": "Backing up Relational Database",
                      "eventCategories": [
                          "backup"
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "resource": "Database-1",
                      "createdAt": 1571654249.98,
                      "message": "Finished Relational Database backup",
                      "eventCategories": [
                          "backup"
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       relationalDatabaseEvents -> (list)
          An  object  describing  the  result  of your get relational database
          events request.

          (structure)
              Describes an event for a database.

              resource -> (string)
                 The database that the database event relates to.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the database event was created.

              message -> (string)
                 The message of the database event.

              eventCategories -> (list)
                 The category that the database event belongs to.

                 (string)

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A next page token is not returned if there are no  more  results  to
          display.

          To  get  the  next  page  of results, perform another GetRelational-
          DatabaseEvents request and specify the next  page  token  using  the
          pageToken parameter.
