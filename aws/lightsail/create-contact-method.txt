          vices Regions.

          o US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1 )

          For a list of countries/regions where SMS text messages can be sent,
          and  the latest Amazon Web Services Regions where SMS text messaging
          is supported, see Supported Regions and Countries in the Amazon  SNS
          Developer Guide .

          For  more  information  about notifications in Amazon Lightsail, see
          Notifications in Amazon Lightsail .

          Possible values:

          o Email

          o SMS

       --contact-endpoint (string)
          The destination of the contact method, such as an email address or a
          mobile phone number.

          Use the E.164 format when specifying a mobile phone number. E.164 is
          a standard for the phone number  structure  used  for  international
          telecommunication.  Phone numbers that follow this format can have a
          maximum of 15 digits, and they are prefixed with the plus  character
          (+)  and the country code. For example, a U.S. phone number in E.164
          format would be specified as +1XXX5550100. For more information, see
          E.164 on Wikipedia .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
