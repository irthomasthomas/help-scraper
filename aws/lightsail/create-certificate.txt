CREATE-CERTIFICATE()                                      CREATE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       create-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an SSL/TLS certificate for an Amazon Lightsail content delivery
       network (CDN) distribution and a container service.

       After the certificate is valid, use the AttachCertificateToDistribution
       action  to  use the certificate and its domains with your distribution.
       Or use the UpdateContainerService action to use the certificate and its
       domains with your container service.

       WARNING:
          Only  certificates  created in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Re-
          gion can be attached to Lightsail distributions. Lightsail distribu-
          tions  are global resources that can reference an origin in any Ama-
          zon Web Services Region, and distribute its content  globally.  How-
          ever, all distributions are located in the us-east-1 Region.

OPTIONS
       --certificate-name (string)
          The name for the certificate.

       --domain-name (string)
          The domain name (e.g., example.com ) for the certificate.

       --subject-alternative-names (list)
          An  array of strings that specify the alternate domains (e.g., exam-
          ple2.com ) and subdomains (e.g., blog.example.com ) for the certifi-
          cate.

          You  can specify a maximum of nine alternate domains (in addition to
          the primary domain name).

          Wildcard domain entries (e.g., *.example.com ) are not supported.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tag keys and optional values to add to  the  certificate  during
          create.

          Use the TagResource action to tag a resource after it's created.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  tag  key  and optional value assigned to an Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

              For more information about tags in  Lightsail,  see  the  Amazon
              Lightsail Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints:  Tag  keys accept a maximum of 128 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values accept a maximum of 256 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                   This can happen as a fraud-protection measure, such as when
                   the  domain  ranks  within  the Alexa top 1000 websites. To

                 NOTE:
                     You  cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned domain
                     names such  as  those  ending  in  amazonaws.com,  cloud-
                     front.net, or elasticbeanstalk.com.

                   the certificate request was reported as an unsafe domain by
                   VirusTotal . To correct the problem, search for your domain
                   name on the VirusTotal website. If your domain is  reported
                   as suspicious, see Google Help for Hacked Websites to learn
                   what you can do. If you believe that the result is a  false
                   positive, notify the organization that is reporting the do-
                   main. VirusTotal is an aggregate of several  antivirus  and
                   URL  scanners  and  cannot  remove your domain from a block
                   list itself. After you correct the problem and the VirusTo-
                   tal  registry  has been updated, request a new certificate.
                   If you see this error and your domain is  not  included  in
                   the  VirusTotal list, visit the AWS Support Center and cre-
                   ate a case.

                   INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN ** - One or more of the domain  names
                   in the certificate request is not valid. Typically, this is
                   because a domain  name  in  the  request  is  not  a  valid
                   top-level  domain. Try to request a certificate again, cor-
                   recting any spelling errors  or  typos  that  were  in  the
                   failed request, and ensure that all domain names in the re-
                   quest are for valid top-level  domains.  For  example,  you
                   cannot  request  a certificate for example.invalidpublicdo-
                   main because invalidpublicdomain is not a  valid  top-level
