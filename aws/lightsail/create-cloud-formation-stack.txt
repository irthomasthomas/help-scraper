CREATE-CLOUD-FORMATION-STACK()                  CREATE-CLOUD-FORMATION-STACK()



NAME
       create-cloud-formation-stack -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an AWS CloudFormation stack, which creates a new Amazon EC2 in-
       stance from an exported Amazon Lightsail snapshot. This  operation  re-
       sults  in  a  CloudFormation stack record that can be used to track the
       AWS CloudFormation stack created. Use the  get  cloud  formation  stack
       records operation to get a list of the CloudFormation stacks created.

       WARNING:
          Wait until after your new Amazon EC2 instance is created before run-
          ning the create cloud formation stack operation again with the  same
          export snapshot record.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-cloud-formation-stack
          --instances <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instances (list)
          An  array  of  parameters that will be used to create the new Amazon
          EC2 instance. You can only pass one instance entry at a time in this
          array. You will get an invalid parameter error if you pass more than
          one instance entry in this array.

          (structure)
              Describes the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance and  related
              resources  to  be created using the create cloud formation stack
              operation.

              sourceName -> (string)
                 The name of the export snapshot record,  which  contains  the
                 exported Lightsail instance snapshot that will be used as the
                 source of the new Amazon EC2 instance.

                 Use the get export snapshot records operation to get  a  list
                 of  export  snapshot  records  that  you  can use to create a
                 CloudFormation stack.

              instanceType -> (string)
                 The instance type (e.g., t2.micro ) to use for the new Amazon
                 EC2 instance.

              portInfoSource -> (string)
                 The  port  configuration  to  use  for the new Amazon EC2 in-
                 stance.

                 The following configuration options are available:

                 o DEFAULT - Use the default firewall settings from the Light-
                   sail  instance  blueprint.  If this is specified, then IPv4
                   and IPv6 will be configured for the new  instance  that  is
                   created in Amazon EC2.

                 o INSTANCE  -  Use  the configured firewall settings from the
                   source Lightsail instance. If this is  specified,  the  new
                   instance  that  is created in Amazon EC2 will be configured
                   to match the configuration  of  the  source  Lightsail  in-
                   stance.  For  example, if the source instance is configured
                   for dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6), then IPv4 and IPv6 will  be
                   configured  for  the new instance that is created in Amazon
                   EC2. If the source instance is configured  for  IPv4  only,
                   then only IPv4 will be configured for the new instance that
                   is created in Amazon EC2.

                 o NONE - Use the default Amazon EC2 security group.  If  this
                   is specified, then only IPv4 will be configured for the new
                   instance that is created in Amazon EC2.

                 o CLOSED - All ports closed. If this is specified, then  only
                   IPv4  will  be configured for the new instance that is cre-
                   ated in Amazon EC2.

                 NOTE:
                     If you configured lightsail-connect as a  cidrListAliases
                     on  your instance, or if you chose to allow the Lightsail
                     browser-based SSH or RDP clients to connect to  your  in-
                     stance,  that  configuration  is not carried over to your
                     new Amazon EC2 instance.

              userData -> (string)
                 A launch script you can create that configures a server  with
                 additional  user  data.  For  example,  you might want to run
                 apt-get -y update .

                 NOTE:
                     Depending on the machine image you choose, the command to
                     get  software  on  your instance varies. Amazon Linux and
                     CentOS use yum , Debian and  Ubuntu  use  apt-get  ,  and
                     FreeBSD uses pkg .

              availabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone for the new Amazon EC2 instance.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          sourceName=string,instanceType=string,portInfoSource=string,userData=string,availabilityZone=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "sourceName": "string",
              "instanceType": "string",
              "portInfoSource": "DEFAULT"|"INSTANCE"|"NONE"|"CLOSED",
              "userData": "string",
              "availabilityZone": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
