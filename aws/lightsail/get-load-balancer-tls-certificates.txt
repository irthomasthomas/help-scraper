GET-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATES()      GET-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       get-load-balancer-tls-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the TLS certificates that are associated with
       the specified Lightsail load balancer.

       TLS is just an updated, more secure  version  of  Secure  Socket  Layer
       (SSL).

       You  can  have  a maximum of 2 certificates associated with a Lightsail
       load balancer. One is active and the other is inactive.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

SYNOPSIS
            get-load-balancer-tls-certificates
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer you associated with your SSL/TLS  cer-
          tificate.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about TLS certificates for a load balancer

       The  following  get-load-balancer-tls-certificates example displays de-
       tails about the TLS certificates for the specified load balancer.

                   in the certificate request is not valid. Typically, this is
                   because a domain  name  in  the  request  is  not  a  valid
                   top-level  domain. Try to request a certificate again, cor-
                   recting any spelling errors  or  typos  that  were  in  the
                   failed request, and ensure that all domain names in the re-
                   quest are for valid top-level  domains.  For  example,  you
                   cannot  request  a certificate for example.invalidpublicdo-
                   main because invalidpublicdomain is not a  valid  top-level
                   domain.
