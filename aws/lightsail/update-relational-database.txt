UPDATE-RELATIONAL-DATABASE()                      UPDATE-RELATIONAL-DATABASE()



NAME
       update-relational-database -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows  the  update  of  one or more attributes of a database in Amazon
       Lightsail.

       Updates are applied immediately, or in cases where  the  updates  could
       result in an outage, are applied during the database's predefined main-
       tenance window.

       The update relational database operation supports tag-based access con-
       trol  via resource tags applied to the resource identified by relation-
       alDatabaseName. For more information, see the Amazon  Lightsail  Devel-
       oper Guide .

OPTIONS
       --relational-database-name (string)
          The name of your Lightsail database resource to update.

       --master-user-password (string)
          The  password  for  the  master  user.  The password can include any
          printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@".

          My**SQL**

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 41 characters.
              PostgreSQL

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 128 characters.

       --rotate-master-user-password | --no-rotate-master-user-password (bool-
       ean)
          When  true  ,  the  master  user password is changed to a new strong
          password generated by Lightsail.

          Use the get relational database master user  password  operation  to
          get the new password.

       --preferred-backup-window (string)
          The  daily time range during which automated backups are created for
          your database if automated backups are enabled.

          Constraints:

          o Must be in the hh24:mi-hh24:mi format. Example: 16:00-16:30

          o Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          o Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.

          o Must be at least 30 minutes.

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The weekly time range during which system maintenance can  occur  on
          your database.

          The  default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
          block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region,  occurring  on  a
          random day of the week.

          Constraints:

          o Must be in the ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi format.

          o Valid days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun.

          o Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          o Example: Tue:17:00-Tue:17:30

       --enable-backup-retention | --no-enable-backup-retention (boolean)
          When true , enables automated backup retention for your database.

          Updates  are applied during the next maintenance window because this
          can result in an outage.

       --disable-backup-retention | --no-disable-backup-retention (boolean)
          When true , disables automated backup retention for your database.

          Disabling backup retention deletes all automated  database  backups.
          Before  disabling  this,  you  may want to create a snapshot of your
          database using the create relational database snapshot operation.

          Updates are applied during the next maintenance window because  this
          can result in an outage.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies  the  accessibility  options for your database. A value of
          true specifies a database that is available to resources outside  of
          your  Lightsail  account. A value of false specifies a database that
          is available only to your Lightsail resources in the same region  as
          your database.

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          When  true  ,  applies  changes  immediately.  When  false , applies
          changes during the preferred maintenance window.  Some  changes  may
          cause an outage.

          Default: false

       --ca-certificate-identifier (string)
          Indicates the certificate that needs to be associated with the data-
          base.

       --relational-database-blueprint-id (string)
          This parameter is used to update the major version of the  database.
          Enter  the blueprintId for the major version that you want to update
          to.

          Use the GetRelationalDatabaseBlueprints action  to  get  a  list  of
          available blueprint IDs.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
