CREATE-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATE()  CREATE-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       create-load-balancer-tls-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an SSL/TLS certificate for an Amazon Lightsail load balancer.

       TLS  is  just  an  updated,  more secure version of Secure Socket Layer
       (SSL).

       The CreateLoadBalancerTlsCertificate operation supports  tag-based  ac-
       cess  control  via  resource tags applied to the resource identified by
       load balancer name . For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail De-
       veloper Guide .

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The load balancer name where you want to create the SSL/TLS certifi-
          cate.

       --certificate-name (string)
          The SSL/TLS certificate name.

          You can have up to 10 certificates in your account at one time. Each
          Lightsail  load  balancer  can  have up to 2 certificates associated
          with it at one time. There is also an overall limit to the number of
          certificates  that can be issue in a 365-day period. For more infor-
          mation, see Limits .

       --certificate-domain-name (string)
          The domain name (example.com ) for your SSL/TLS certificate.

       --certificate-alternative-names (list)
          An array of strings listing alternative domains and  subdomains  for
          your  SSL/TLS certificate. Lightsail will de-dupe the names for you.
          You can have a maximum of 9 alternative names (in addition to the  1
          primary domain). We do not support wildcards (*.example.com ).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The  tag keys and optional values to add to the resource during cre-
          ate.

          Use the TagResource action to tag a resource after it's created.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag key and optional value  assigned  to  an  Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

              For  more  information  about  tags in Lightsail, see the Amazon
              Lightsail Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag keys accept a maximum of 128  letters,  num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values accept a maximum of 256 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a TLS certificate for a load balancer

       The  following  create-load-balancer-tls-certificate  example creates a
       TLS certificate that is attached to the specified  load  balancer.  The
       certificate  created  applies to the specified domains.  Note: Only two
       certificates can be created for a load balancer.

          aws lightsail create-load-balancer-tls-certificate \
              --certificate-alternative-names abc.example.com \
              --certificate-domain-name example.com \
              --certificate-name MySecondCertificate \
              --load-balancer-name MyFirstLoadBalancer
