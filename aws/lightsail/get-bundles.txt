GET-BUNDLES()                                                    GET-BUNDLES()



NAME
       get-bundles -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the bundles that you can apply to an Amazon Lightsail instance
       when you create it.

       A bundle describes the specifications  of  an  instance,  such  as  the
       monthly  cost, amount of memory, the number of vCPUs, amount of storage
       space, and monthly network data transfer quota.

       NOTE:
          Bundles are referred to as instance plans in the Lightsail console.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-bundles is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: bundles

OPTIONS
       --include-inactive | --no-include-inactive (boolean)
          A Boolean value that indicates whether to include inactive (unavail-
          able) bundles in the response of your request.

       --app-category (string)
          Returns a list of bundles that are specific  to  Lightsail  for  Re-
          search.

          WARNING:
              You  must use this parameter to view Lightsail for Research bun-
              dles.

          Possible values:

          o LfR

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       bundles -> (list)
          An array of key-value pairs  that  contains  information  about  the
          available bundles.

          (structure)
              Describes a bundle, which is a set of specs describing your vir-
              tual private server (or instance ).

              price -> (float)
                 The price in US dollars (5.0 ) of the bundle.

              cpuCount -> (integer)
                 The number of vCPUs included in the bundle (2 ).

              diskSizeInGb -> (integer)
                 The size of the SSD (30 ).

              bundleId -> (string)
                 The bundle ID (micro_x_x ).

              instanceType -> (string)
                 The instance type (micro ).

              isActive -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether the bundle is active.

              name -> (string)
                 A friendly name for the bundle (Micro ).

              power -> (integer)
                 A numeric value that represents the power of the bundle  (500
                 ). You can use the bundle's power value in conjunction with a
                 blueprint's minimum power  value  to  determine  whether  the
                 blueprint  will  run  on  the bundle. For example, you need a
                 bundle with a power value of 500 or more  to  create  an  in-
                 stance  that  uses  a blueprint with a minimum power value of
                 500.

              ramSizeInGb -> (float)
                 The amount of RAM in GB (2.0 ).

              transferPerMonthInGb -> (integer)
                 The data transfer rate per month in GB (2000 ).

              supportedPlatforms -> (list)
                 The operating system platform  (Linux/Unix-based  or  Windows
                 Server-based) that the bundle supports. You can only launch a
                 WINDOWS bundle on a blueprint that supports the WINDOWS plat-
                 form. LINUX_UNIX blueprints require a LINUX_UNIX bundle.

                 (string)

              supportedAppCategories -> (list)
                 Virtual computer blueprints that are supported by a Lightsail
                 for Research bundle.

                 WARNING:
                     This parameter only applies to Lightsail for Research re-
                     sources.

                 (string)

              publicIpv4AddressCount -> (integer)
                 An  integer  that indicates the public ipv4 address count in-
                 cluded in the bundle, the value is either 0 or 1.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A next page token is not returned if there are no  more  results  to
          display.

          To  get the next page of results, perform another GetBundles request
          and specify the next page token using the pageToken parameter.
