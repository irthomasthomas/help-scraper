EXPORT-SNAPSHOT()                                            EXPORT-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       export-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports  an Amazon Lightsail instance or block storage disk snapshot to
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). This operation results in an
       export snapshot record that can be used with the create cloud formation
       stack operation to create new Amazon EC2 instances.

       Exported instance snapshots appear in Amazon EC2 as Amazon Machine  Im-
       ages  (AMIs), and the instance system disk appears as an Amazon Elastic
       Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Exported disk snapshots appear in Ama-
       zon  EC2 as Amazon EBS volumes. Snapshots are exported to the same Ama-
       zon Web Services Region in Amazon EC2 as the source Lightsail snapshot.

       The export snapshot operation supports tag-based access control via re-
       source  tags applied to the resource identified by source snapshot name
       . For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       NOTE:
          Use the get instance snapshots or get disk snapshots  operations  to
          get a list of snapshots that you can export to Amazon EC2.

SYNOPSIS
            export-snapshot
          --source-snapshot-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-snapshot-name (string)
          The  name  of the instance or disk snapshot to be exported to Amazon
          EC2.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
