GET-BUCKET-ACCESS-KEYS()                              GET-BUCKET-ACCESS-KEYS()



NAME
       get-bucket-access-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the existing access key IDs for the specified Amazon Lightsail
       bucket.

       WARNING:
          This action does not return the secret access key value of an access
          key.  You  can  get a secret access key only when you create it from
          the response of the CreateBucketAccessKey action. If  you  lose  the
          secret access key, you must create a new access key.

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to return access keys.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       accessKeys -> (list)
          An object that describes the access keys for the specified bucket.

          (structure)
              Describes an access key for an Amazon Lightsail bucket.

              Access keys grant full  programmatic  access  to  the  specified
              bucket  and  its  objects.  You can have a maximum of two access
              keys per bucket. Use the CreateBucketAccessKey action to  create
              an  access key for a specific bucket. For more information about
              access keys, see Creating access keys for  a  bucket  in  Amazon
              Lightsail in the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

              WARNING:
                 The secretAccessKey value is returned only in response to the
                 CreateBucketAccessKey action. You can get a secret access key
                 only  when you first create an access key; you cannot get the
                 secret access key later. If you lose the secret  access  key,
                 you must create a new access key.

              accessKeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the access key.

              secretAccessKey -> (string)
                 The secret access key used to sign requests.

                 You should store the secret access key in a safe location. We
                 recommend that you delete the access key if the secret access
                 key is compromised.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the access key.

                 A  status  of Active means that the key is valid, while Inac-
                 tive means it is not.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the access key was created.

              lastUsed -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the last time  the  access  key  was
                 used.

                 NOTE:
                     This  object  does  not include data in the response of a
                     CreateBucketAccessKey action. If the access key  has  not
                     been  used,  the  region and serviceName values are N/A ,
                     and the lastUsedDate value is null.

                 lastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time when the access key was  most  recently
                     used.

                     This value is null if the access key has not been used.

                 region -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Web Services Region where this access key was
                     most recently used.

                     This value is N/A if the access key has not been used.

                 serviceName -> (string)
                     The name of the Amazon Web Services  service  with  which
                     this access key was most recently used.

                     This value is N/A if the access key has not been used.
