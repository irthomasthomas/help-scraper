CREATE-DOMAIN-ENTRY()                                    CREATE-DOMAIN-ENTRY()



NAME
       create-domain-entry -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  one of the following domain name system (DNS) records in a do-
       main DNS zone: Address (A),  canonical  name  (CNAME),  mail  exchanger
       (MX),  name  server  (NS),  start  of  authority (SOA), service locator
       (SRV), or text (TXT).

       The create domain entry operation supports tag-based access control via
       resource  tags  applied to the resource identified by domain name . For
       more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The domain name (example.com ) for which you want to create the  do-
          main entry.

       --domain-entry (structure)
          An  array of key-value pairs containing information about the domain
          entry request.

          id -> (string)
              The ID of the domain recordset entry.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the domain.

          target -> (string)
              The  target  IP  address  (192.0.2.0  ),  or  AWS  name   server
              (ns-111.awsdns-22.com. ).

              For   Lightsail   load   balancers,   the   value   looks   like
              ab1234c56789c6b86aba6fb203d443bc-123456789.us-east-2.elb.amazon-
              aws.com  . For Lightsail distributions, the value looks like ex-
              ampled1182ne.cloudfront.net . For Lightsail container  services,
              the      value      looks     like     container-service-1.exam-
              ple23scljs.us-west-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com . Be  sure  to  also
              set  isAlias to true when setting up an A record for a Lightsail
              load balancer, distribution, or container service.

          isAlias -> (boolean)
              When true , specifies whether the domain entry is an alias  used
              by  the  Lightsail  load  balancer, Lightsail container service,
              Lightsail content delivery network (CDN)  distribution,  or  an-
              other  Amazon Web Services resource. You can include an alias (A
              type) record in your request, which points to the DNS name of  a
              load  balancer,  container  service,  CDN distribution, or other
              Amazon Web Services resource and  routes  traffic  to  that  re-
              source.

          type -> (string)
              The  type of domain entry, such as address for IPv4 (A), address
              for IPv6 (AAAA), canonical name (CNAME),  mail  exchanger  (MX),
              name  server  (NS),  start  of  authority (SOA), service locator
              (SRV), or text (TXT).

              The following domain entry types can be used:

              o A

              o AAAA

              o CNAME

              o MX

              o NS

              o SOA

              o SRV

              o TXT

          options -> (map)
              (Discontinued) The options for the domain entry.

              NOTE:
                 In releases prior to November 29, 2017,  this  parameter  was
                 not included in the API response. It is now discontinued.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          id=string,name=string,target=string,isAlias=boolean,type=string,options={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "id": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "target": "string",
            "isAlias": true|false,
            "type": "string",
            "options": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a domain entry (DNS record)

       The following create-domain-entry example creates a DNS record (A)  for
       the  apex  of  the specified domain that points to an instance's IP ad-
       dress.

       Note: Lightsail's domain-related API operations are available  in  only
       the  us-east-1  Region. If your CLI profile is configured to use a dif-
       ferent Region, you must include the --region us-east-1 parameter or the
       command fails.

          aws lightsail create-domain-entry \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com \
              --domain-entry name=example.com,type=A,target=192.0.2.0

       Output:

          {
              "operation": {
                  "id": "5be4494d-56f4-41fc-8730-693dcd0ef9e2",
                  "resourceName": "example.com",
                  "resourceType": "Domain",
                  "createdAt": 1569865296.519,
                  "location": {
                      "availabilityZone": "all",
                      "regionName": "global"
                  },
                  "isTerminal": true,
                  "operationType": "CreateDomainEntry",
                  "status": "Succeeded",
                  "statusChangedAt": 1569865296.519
              }
          }
