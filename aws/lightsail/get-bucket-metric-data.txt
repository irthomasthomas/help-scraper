GET-BUCKET-METRIC-DATA()                              GET-BUCKET-METRIC-DATA()



NAME
       get-bucket-metric-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  data  points of a specific metric for an Amazon Lightsail
       bucket.

       Metrics report the utilization of a bucket.  View  and  collect  metric
       data regularly to monitor the number of objects stored in a bucket (in-
       cluding object versions) and the storage space used by those objects.

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to get metric data.

       --metric-name (string)
          The metric for which you want to return information.

          Valid bucket metric names are listed below, along with the most use-
          ful  statistics  to  include in your request, and the published unit
          value.

          NOTE:
              These bucket metrics are reported once per day.

          o

            **
            BucketSizeBytes ** - The amount of  data  in  bytes  stored  in  a
            bucket.  This  value  is calculated by summing the size of all ob-
            jects in the bucket (including  object  versions),  including  the
            size  of  all  parts  for  all incomplete multipart uploads to the
            bucket. Statistics: The most useful statistic is Maximum  .  Unit:
            The published unit is Bytes .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 96)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          o

            **
            NumberOfObjects  **  -  The  total  number  of objects stored in a
            bucket. This value is calculated by counting all  objects  in  the
            bucket  (including  object versions) and the total number of parts
            for all incomplete multipart uploads to  the  bucket.  Statistics:
            The most useful statistic is Average . Unit: The published unit is
            Count .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 98)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          Possible values:

          o BucketSizeBytes

          o NumberOfObjects

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp indicating the earliest data to be returned.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp indicating the latest data to be returned.

       --period (integer)
          The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points.

          NOTE:
              Bucket storage metrics are reported once per day. Therefore, you
              should specify a period of 86400 seconds, which is the number of
              seconds in a day.

       --statistics (list)
          The statistic for the metric.

          The following statistics are available:

          o Minimum - The lowest value observed during the  specified  period.
            Use  this  value to determine low volumes of activity for your ap-
            plication.

          o Maximum - The highest value observed during the specified  period.
            Use  this value to determine high volumes of activity for your ap-
            plication.

          o Sum - The sum of all values submitted for the matching metric. You
            can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a metric.

          o Average  - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified pe-
            riod. By comparing this statistic with  the  Minimum  and  Maximum
            values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close
            the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This compar-
            ison  helps  you  to  know  when  to increase or decrease your re-
            sources.

          o SampleCount - The count, or number, of data points  used  for  the
            statistical calculation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Minimum
            Maximum
            Sum
            Average
            SampleCount

       --unit (string)
          The unit for the metric data request.

          Valid units depend on the metric data being requested. For the valid
          units with each available metric, see the metricName parameter.

          Possible values:

          o Seconds

          o Microseconds

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
