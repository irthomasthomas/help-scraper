NAME
       attach-certificate-to-distribution -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches an SSL/TLS certificate to your Amazon Lightsail content deliv-
       ery network (CDN) distribution.

       After the certificate is  attached,  your  distribution  accepts  HTTPS
       traffic  for  all  of the domains that are associated with the certifi-
       cate.

       Use the CreateCertificate action to create a certificate that  you  can
       attach to your distribution.

       WARNING:
          Only  certificates  created in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Re-
          gion can be attached to Lightsail distributions. Lightsail distribu-
          tions  are global resources that can reference an origin in any Ama-
          zon Web Services Region, and distribute its content  globally.  How-
          ever, all distributions are located in the us-east-1 Region.

OPTIONS
       --distribution-name (string)
          The  name  of the distribution that the certificate will be attached
          to.

          Use the GetDistributions action to get a list of distribution  names
          that you can specify.

       --certificate-name (string)
          The name of the certificate to attach to a distribution.

          Only  certificates with a status of ISSUED can be attached to a dis-
          tribution.

          Use the GetCertificates action to get a list  of  certificate  names
          that you can specify.

          NOTE:
              This  is  the  name of the certificate resource type and is used
              only to reference the certificate in other API actions.  It  can
              be  different than the domain name of the certificate. For exam-
              ple, your certificate name might  be  WordPress-Blog-Certificate
              and the domain name of the certificate might be example.com .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
