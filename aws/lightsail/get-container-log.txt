GET-CONTAINER-LOG()                                        GET-CONTAINER-LOG()



NAME
       get-container-log -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  log  events  of a container of your Amazon Lightsail con-
       tainer service.

       If your container service has more than one node (i.e., a scale greater
       than  1),  then the log events that are returned for the specified con-
       tainer are merged from all nodes on your container service.

       NOTE:
          Container logs are retained for a certain amount of time.  For  more
          information,  see  Amazon  Lightsail endpoints and quotas in the AWS
          General Reference .

OPTIONS
       --service-name (string)
          The name of the container service for which to get a container log.

       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container that is either running or  previously  ran
          on the container service for which to return a log.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time interval for which to get log data.

          Constraints:

          o Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          o Specified in the Unix time format. For example, if you wish to use
            a start time of October 1, 2018, at 8 PM UTC,  specify  1538424000
            as the start time.

          You  can  convert  a human-friendly time to Unix time format using a
          converter like Epoch converter .

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to get log data.

          Constraints:

          o Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          o Specified in the Unix time format. For example, if you wish to use
            an end time of October 1, 2018, at 9 PM UTC, specify 1538427600 as
            the end time.

          You can convert a human-friendly time to Unix time  format  using  a
          converter like Epoch converter .

       --filter-pattern (string)
          The  pattern  to use to filter the returned log events to a specific
          term.

          The following are a few examples of filter  patterns  that  you  can
          specify:

          o To return all log events, specify a filter pattern of "" .

          o To  exclude log events that contain the ERROR term, and return all
            other log events, specify a filter pattern of "-ERROR" .

          o To return log events that contain the ERROR term, specify a filter
            pattern of "ERROR" .

          o To  return  log  events  that contain both the ERROR and Exception
            terms, specify a filter pattern of "ERROR Exception" .

          o To return log events that contain  the  ERROR   or  the  Exception
            term, specify a filter pattern of "?ERROR ?Exception" .

       --page-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          To  get a page token, perform an initial GetContainerLog request. If
          your results are paginated, the response will return a next page to-
          ken that you can specify as the page token in a subsequent request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       logEvents -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe the log events of a container.

          (structure)
              Describes the log events of a container of an  Amazon  Lightsail
              container service.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  when the container service log event was cre-
                 ated.

              message -> (string)
                 The message of the container service log event.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A next page token is not returned if there are no  more  results  to
          display.

          To get the next page of results, perform another GetContainerLog re-
          quest and specify the next page token using the pageToken parameter.
