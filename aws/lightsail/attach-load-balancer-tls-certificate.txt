ATTACH-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATE()  ATTACH-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       attach-load-balancer-tls-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate to your load bal-
       ancer. TLS is just an updated, more secure  version  of  Secure  Socket
       Layer (SSL).

       Once  you  create  and  validate your certificate, you can attach it to
       your load balancer. You can also use this API to  rotate  the  certifi-
       cates  on your account. Use the AttachLoadBalancerTlsCertificate action
       with the non-attached certificate, and it will replace the existing one
       and become the attached certificate.

       The  AttachLoadBalancerTlsCertificate  operation supports tag-based ac-
       cess control via resource tags applied to the  resource  identified  by
       load balancer name . For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail De-
       veloper Guide .

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer to which you  want  to  associate  the
          SSL/TLS certificate.

       --certificate-name (string)
          The name of your SSL/TLS certificate.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To attach a TLS certificate to a load balancer

       The following attach-load-balancer-tls-certificate example attaches the
       load balancer TLS certificate Certificate2 to the load  balancer  Load-
       Balancer-1.

          aws lightsail attach-load-balancer-tls-certificate \
              --certificate-name Certificate2 \
              --load-balancer-name LoadBalancer-1
