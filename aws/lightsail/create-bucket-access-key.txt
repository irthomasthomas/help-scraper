CREATE-BUCKET-ACCESS-KEY()                          CREATE-BUCKET-ACCESS-KEY()



NAME
       create-bucket-access-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new access key for the specified Amazon Lightsail bucket. Ac-
       cess keys consist of an access key ID and corresponding  secret  access
       key.

       Access  keys grant full programmatic access to the specified bucket and
       its objects. You can have a maximum of two access keys per bucket.  Use
       the GetBucketAccessKeys action to get a list of current access keys for
       a specific bucket. For more information about access keys, see Creating
       access  keys  for  a bucket in Amazon Lightsail in the Amazon Lightsail
       Developer Guide .

       WARNING:
          The secretAccessKey value is returned only in response to  the  Cre-
          ateBucketAccessKey action. You can get a secret access key only when
          you first create an access key; you cannot get the secret access key
          later.  If you lose the secret access key, you must create a new ac-
          cess key.

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket that the new access key will belong  to,  and
          grant access to.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              NOTE:
                 This  object  does  not  include  data  in  the response of a
                 CreateBucketAccessKey action. If the access key has not  been
                 used,  the  region  and  serviceName values are N/A , and the

       operations -> (list)
          An  array of objects that describe the result of the action, such as
