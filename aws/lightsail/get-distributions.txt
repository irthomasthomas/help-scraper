NAME
       get-distributions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about one or more of your Amazon Lightsail content
       delivery network (CDN) distributions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-distributions
          [--distribution-name <value>]
          [--page-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --distribution-name (string)
          The name of the distribution for which to return information.

          When omitted, the response includes all of your distributions in the
          Amazon Web Services Region where the request is made.

       --page-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          To get a page token, perform an initial GetDistributions request. If
          your results are paginated, the response will return a next page to-
          ken that you can specify as the page token in a subsequent request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     The cache behavior of the distribution.

                     The following cache behaviors can be specified:

                     o

                       **
                       cache ** - This option is best for static  sites.  When
                       specified, your distribution caches and serves your en-
                       tire website as static content. This behavior is  ideal
                       for  websites  with  static content that doesn't change
                       depending on who views it, or for websites  that  don't
                       use  cookies,  headers, or query strings to personalize
                       content.

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 339)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                     o

                       **
                       dont-cache ** - This option  is  best  for  sites  that
                       serve  a mix of static and dynamic content. When speci-
                       fied, your distribution caches and serve only the  con-
                       tent  that  is specified in the distribution's CacheBe-
                       haviorPerPath parameter. This  behavior  is  ideal  for
                       websites or web applications that use cookies, headers,
                       and query strings to personalize content for individual
                       users.

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 341)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

              cacheBehaviorSettings -> (structure)
                 An  object  that describes the cache behavior settings of the
                 distribution.

                 defaultTTL -> (long)
                     The default amount of time that objects stay in the  dis-
                     tribution's  cache  before  the distribution forwards an-
                     other request to the origin to determine whether the con-
                     tent has been updated.

                     NOTE:
                        The  value specified applies only when the origin does
                        not add HTTP headers such as Cache-Control  max-age  ,
                        Cache-Control s-maxage , and Expires to objects.

                 minimumTTL -> (long)
                     The  minimum amount of time that objects stay in the dis-
                     tribution's cache before the  distribution  forwards  an-
                     other  request to the origin to determine whether the ob-
                     ject has been updated.

                     A value of 0 must be specified for minimumTTL if the dis-
                     tribution  is  configured  to  forward all headers to the
                     origin.

                 maximumTTL -> (long)
                     The maximum amount of time that objects stay in the  dis-
                     tribution's  cache  before  the distribution forwards an-
                     other request to the origin to determine whether the  ob-
                     ject has been updated.

                     The  value  specified  applies  only when the origin adds
                     HTTP headers such as Cache-Control max-age  ,  Cache-Con-
                     trol s-maxage , and Expires to objects.

                 allowedHTTPMethods -> (string)
                     The  HTTP methods that are processed and forwarded to the
                     distribution's origin.

                     You can specify the following options:

                     o GET,HEAD - The distribution forwards the GET  and  HEAD
                       methods.

                     o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS  - The distribution forwards the GET ,
                       HEAD , and OPTIONS methods.

                     o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE - The  distribu-
                       tion  forwards the GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PUT , PATCH ,
                       POST , and DELETE methods.

                     If you specify the third option, you might  need  to  re-
                     strict  access  to  your  distribution's  origin so users
                     can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For
                     example,  you  might not want users to have permission to
                     delete objects from your origin.

                 cachedHTTPMethods -> (string)
                     The HTTP method responses that are cached by your distri-
                     bution.

                     You can specify the following options:

                     o GET,HEAD - The distribution caches responses to the GET
                       and HEAD methods.

                     o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS - The distribution caches responses to
                       the GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS methods.

                 forwardedCookies -> (structure)
                     An  object  that describes the cookies that are forwarded
                     to the origin. Your content is cached based on the  cook-
                     ies that are forwarded.

                     option -> (string)
                        Specifies  which  cookies  to forward to the distribu-
                        tion's origin for a cache behavior: all ,  none  ,  or
                        allow-list  to  forward  only the cookies specified in
                        the cookiesAllowList parameter.

                     An  object  that describes the headers that are forwarded
                     to the origin. Your content is cached based on the  head-
                     ers that are forwarded.

                     option -> (string)
                        The headers that you want your distribution to forward
                        to your origin and base caching on.

                        You can configure your distribution to do one  of  the
                        following:

                        o

                          **
                          all ** - Forward all headers to your origin.

                        System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 513)
                          Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                        o

                          **
                          allow-list ** - Forward only the headers you specify
                          using the headersAllowList parameter.

                        System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 517)
                          Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                     headersAllowList -> (list)
                        The specific headers to forward to your distribution's
                        origin.

                        (string)

                 forwardedQueryStrings -> (structure)
                     An  object that describes the query strings that are for-
                     warded to the origin. Your content is cached based on the
                     query strings that are forwarded.

                     option -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the distribution forwards and caches
                        based on query strings.

                     queryStringsAllowList -> (list)
                        The specific query strings that the distribution  for-
                        wards to the origin.

                        Your  distribution  will  cache  content  based on the
                        specified query strings.

                        If the option parameter is true, then  your  distribu-
                        tion  forwards  all  query strings, regardless of what
                        you specify using the queryStringsAllowList parameter.

                        (string)

              cacheBehaviors -> (list)
                 An array of objects that describe the per-path cache behavior
                 of the distribution.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the per-path cache behavior of an Amazon Light-
                     sail content delivery network (CDN) distribution.

                     A per-path cache behavior is used to override, or add  an
                     exception  to,  the default cache behavior of a distribu-
                     tion. For example, if the cacheBehavior is set to cache ,
                     then  a  per-path cache behavior can be used to specify a
                     directory, file, or file type that your distribution will
                     cache.  Alternately,  if the distribution's cacheBehavior
                     is dont-cache , then a per-path  cache  behavior  can  be
                     used to specify a directory, file, or file type that your
                     distribution will not cache.

                     path -> (string)
                        The path to a directory or  file  to  cached,  or  not
                        cache.  Use an asterisk symbol to specify wildcard di-
                        rectories (path/to/assets/* ), and file types (*.html,
                        *jpg,  *js ). Directories and file paths are case-sen-
                        sitive.

                        Examples:

                        o Specify the following to cache all files in the doc-
                          ument  root  of  an  Apache  web server running on a
                          Lightsail instance.  var/www/html/

                        o Specify the following file to cache only  the  index
                          page  in  the document root of an Apache web server.
                          var/www/html/index.html

                        o Specify the following to cache only the .html  files
                          in  the  document  root  of  an  Apache  web server.
                          var/www/html/*.html

                        o Specify the following to cache only the .jpg,  .png,
                          and  .gif  files  in the images sub-directory of the
                          document   root   of   an   Apache    web    server.
                          var/www/html/images/*.jpg           var/www/html/im-
                          ages/*.png     var/www/html/images/*.gif     Specify
                          the  following  to  cache  all  files  in the images
