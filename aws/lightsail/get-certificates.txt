NAME
       get-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about one or more Amazon Lightsail SSL/TLS certifi-
       cates.

OPTIONS
       --certificate-statuses (list)
          The status of the certificates for which to return information.

          For example, specify ISSUED to return only certificates with an  IS-
          SUED status.

          When  omitted, the response includes all of your certificates in the
          Amazon Web Services Region where the request is made, regardless  of
          their current status.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            PENDING_VALIDATION
            ISSUED
            INACTIVE
            EXPIRED
            VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT
            REVOKED
            FAILED

       --include-certificate-details | --no-include-certificate-details (bool-
       ean)
          Indicates whether to include detailed information about the certifi-
          cates in the response.

          When omitted, the response includes only the certificate names, Ama-
          zon Resource Names (ARNs), domain names, and tags.

       --certificate-name (string)
          The name for the certificate for which to return information.

          When omitted, the response includes all of your certificates in  the
          Amazon Web Services Region where the request is made.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

                       domain  by  VirusTotal . To correct the problem, search
                       for your domain name on the VirusTotal website. If your
                       domain  is  reported as suspicious, see Google Help for
                       Hacked Websites to learn what you can do.  If  you  be-

                       organization that is reporting the  domain.  VirusTotal
                       is  an  aggregate of several antivirus and URL scanners
                       and cannot remove your domain from a block list itself.

                       you  see  this error and your domain is not included in
                       the VirusTotal list, visit the Amazon Web Services Sup-
