NAME
       get-buckets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about one or more Amazon Lightsail buckets. The in-
       formation returned includes the synchronization status  of  the  Amazon
       Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon S3) account-level block public access
       feature for your Lightsail buckets.

       For more information about buckets, see Buckets in Amazon Lightsail  in
       the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to return information.

          When  omitted, the response includes all of your buckets in the Ama-
          zon Web Services Region where the request is made.

       --page-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          To get a page token, perform an initial GetBuckets request. If  your
          results  are  paginated,  the response will return a next page token
          that you can specify as the page token in a subsequent request.

       --include-connected-resources | --no-include-connected-resources (bool-
       ean)
          A  Boolean  value  that  indicates  whether to include Lightsail in-
          stances  that  were  given  access   to   the   bucket   using   the
          SetResourceAccessForBucket action.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       buckets -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe buckets.

          (structure)
              Describes an Amazon Lightsail bucket.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The Lightsail resource type of the bucket.

              accessRules -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the access rules of the bucket.

                 getObject -> (string)
                     Specifies the  anonymous  access  to  all  objects  in  a
                     bucket.

                     The following options can be specified:

                     o public  -  Sets  all  objects  in  the bucket to public
                       (read-only), making them  readable  by  anyone  in  the
                       world.  If  the getObject value is set to public , then
                       all objects in the bucket default to public  regardless
                       of the allowPublicOverrides value.

                     o private  -  Sets  all objects in the bucket to private,
                       making them readable only by you or anyone you give ac-
                       cess to. If the getObject value is set to private , and
                       the allowPublicOverrides value is set to  true  ,  then
                       all  objects  in  the  bucket default to private unless
                       they are configured with a public-read ACL.  Individual
                       objects  with  a public-read ACL are readable by anyone
                       in the world.

                 allowPublicOverrides -> (boolean)
                     A Boolean value that indicates whether the access control
                     list (ACL) permissions that are applied to individual ob-
                     jects override the getObject  option  that  is  currently
                     specified.

                     When this is true, you can use the PutObjectAcl Amazon S3
                     API  action  to  set   individual   objects   to   public
                     (read-only)  using the public-read ACL, or to private us-
                     ing the private ACL.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.

              bundleId -> (string)
                 The ID of the bundle currently applied to the bucket.

                 A bucket bundle specifies the monthly  cost,  storage  space,
                 and data transfer quota for a bucket.

                 Use  the  UpdateBucketBundle action to change the bundle of a
                 bucket.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the distribution was created.

              url -> (string)
                 The URL of the bucket.

              location -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the location of the bucket, such  as
                 the Amazon Web Services Region and Availability Zone.

                 availabilityZone -> (string)
                     The  Availability  Zone.  Follows  the  format us-east-2a
                     (case-sensitive).

                     The Amazon Web Services Region name.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket.

              supportCode -> (string)
                 The support code for a bucket.  Include  this  code  in  your
                 email  to  support  when you have questions about a Lightsail
                 bucket. This code enables our support team to  look  up  your
                 Lightsail information more easily.

              tags -> (list)
                 The tag keys and optional values for the bucket. For more in-
                 formation, see Tags in Amazon Lightsail in the Amazon  Light-
                 sail Developer Guide .

                 (structure)
                     Describes  a  tag  key  and optional value assigned to an
                     Amazon Lightsail resource.

                     For more information about tags  in  Lightsail,  see  the
                     Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

                     key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag  values accept a maximum of 256 let-
                        ters, numbers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following char-
                        acters: + - = . _ : / @

              objectVersioning -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  object  versioning  is  enabled  for  the
                 bucket.

                 The following options can be configured:

                 o Enabled - Object versioning is enabled.

                 o Suspended - Object versioning was previously enabled but is
                   currently suspended. Existing object versions are retained.

                 o NeverEnabled - Object versioning has never been enabled.

              ableToUpdateBundle -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the bundle that is currently applied to a
                 bucket can be changed to another bundle.

                 You can update a bucket's  bundle  only  one  time  within  a
                 monthly Amazon Web Services billing cycle.

                 Use  the  UpdateBucketBundle action to change a bucket's bun-
                 dle.

              readonlyAccessAccounts -> (list)
                 An array of strings that specify the Amazon Web Services  ac-
                 count IDs that have read-only access to the bucket.

                 (string)

              resourcesReceivingAccess -> (list)
                 An  array  of  objects that describe Lightsail instances that
                 have access to the bucket.

                 Use the SetResourceAccessForBucket action to update  the  in-
                 stances that have access to a bucket.

                 (structure)
                     Describes an Amazon Lightsail instance that has access to
                     a Lightsail bucket.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the Lightsail instance.

                     resourceType -> (string)
                        The Lightsail resource type (for example, Instance ).

              state -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the state of the bucket.

                 code -> (string)
                     The state code of the bucket.

                     The following codes are possible:

                     o OK - The bucket is in a running state.

                     o Unknown - Creation of the bucket might have  timed-out.
                       You  might  want  to delete the bucket and create a new
                       one.

                 message -> (string)
                     A message that describes the state of the bucket.

              accessLogConfig -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the access log configuration for the
                 bucket.

                 enabled -> (boolean)
                     A Boolean value that indicates whether bucket access log-
                     ging is enabled for the bucket.

                 destination -> (string)
                     The name of the bucket where the access logs  are  saved.
                     The destination can be a Lightsail bucket in the same ac-
                     count, and in the same Amazon Web Services Region as  the
                     source bucket.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter  is  required when enabling the access
                        log for a bucket, and should be omitted when disabling
                        the access log.

                 prefix -> (string)
                     The optional object prefix for the bucket access log.

                     The prefix is an optional addition to the object key that
                     organizes  your  access  log  files  in  the  destination
                     bucket.  For example, if you specify a logs/ prefix, then
                     each log object will begin with the logs/ prefix  in  its
                     key                     (for                     example,
                     logs/2021-11-01-21-32-16-E568B2907131C0C0 ).

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter can be optionally  specified  when  en-
                        abling  the  access  log  for  a bucket, and should be
                        omitted when disabling the access log.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A next page token is not returned if there are no  more  results  to
          display.

          To  get the next page of results, perform another GetBuckets request
          and specify the next page token using the pageToken parameter.

       accountLevelBpaSync -> (structure)
          An object that describes the synchronization status of the Amazon S3
          account-level  block  public access feature for your Lightsail buck-
          ets.

          For more information about this feature and how it affects Lightsail
          buckets, see Block public access for buckets in Amazon Lightsail .

          status -> (string)
              The status of the account-level BPA synchronization.

              The following statuses are possible:

              o InSync  - Account-level BPA is synchronized. The Amazon S3 ac-
                count-level BPA configuration applies to your Lightsail  buck-
                ets.

              o NeverSynced - Synchronization has not yet happened. The Amazon
                S3 account-level BPA configuration  does  not  apply  to  your
                Lightsail buckets.

              o Failed  -  Synchronization failed. The Amazon S3 account-level
                BPA configuration does not apply to your Lightsail buckets.

              o Defaulted - Synchronization failed and account-level  BPA  for
                your Lightsail buckets is defaulted to active .

              NOTE:
                 You  might  need to complete further actions if the status is
                 Failed or Defaulted . The message parameter provides more in-
                 formation for those statuses.

          lastSyncedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  timestamp  of  when the account-level BPA configuration was
              last synchronized. This value is null when the account-level BPA
              configuration has not been synchronized.

          message -> (string)
              A  message that provides a reason for a Failed or Defaulted syn-
              chronization status.

              The following messages are possible:

              o SYNC_ON_HOLD - The synchronization has not yet happened.  This
                status  message occurs immediately after you create your first
                Lightsail bucket. This status message should change after  the
                first  synchronization happens, approximately 1 hour after the
                first bucket is created.

              o DEFAULTED_FOR_SLR_MISSING - The synchronization failed because
                the  required  service-linked role is missing from your Amazon
                Web Services account. The account-level BPA configuration  for
                your  Lightsail  buckets is defaulted to active until the syn-
                chronization can occur. This means that all your  buckets  are
                private  and  not  publicly  accessible.  For more information
                about how to create the required service-linked role to  allow
                synchronization,  see  Using  Service-Linked  Roles for Amazon
                Lightsail in the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

              o DEFAULTED_FOR_SLR_MISSING_ON_HOLD - The synchronization failed
                because  the required service-linked role is missing from your
                Amazon Web Services account. Account-level BPA is not yet con-
                figured for your Lightsail buckets. Therefore, only the bucket
                access permissions and individual  object  access  permissions
                apply  to  your  Lightsail buckets. For more information about
                how to create the required service-linked role to  allow  syn-
                chronization, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon Light-
                sail in the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

              o Unknown - The reason that synchronization failed  is  unknown.
                Contact Amazon Web Services Support for more information.

          bpaImpactsLightsail -> (boolean)
              A  Boolean value that indicates whether account-level block pub-
              lic access is affecting your Lightsail buckets.
