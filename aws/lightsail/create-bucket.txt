NAME
       create-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon Lightsail bucket.

       A  bucket is a cloud storage resource available in the Lightsail object
       storage service. Use buckets to store objects such as data and its  de-
       scriptive  metadata. For more information about buckets, see Buckets in
       Amazon Lightsail in the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

          The ID of the bundle to use for the bucket.

          A  bucket bundle specifies the monthly cost, storage space, and data
          transfer quota for a bucket.

          The tag keys and optional values to add to the  bucket  during  cre-
          ation.

          Use the TagResource action to tag the bucket after it's created.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  tag  key  and optional value assigned to an Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

              For more information about tags in  Lightsail,  see  the  Amazon
              Lightsail Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --enable-object-versioning | --no-enable-object-versioning (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value that indicates whether to enable versioning of ob-
          jects in the bucket.

          For more information about versioning, see Enabling  and  suspending
          object  versioning  in  a  bucket  in Amazon Lightsail in the Amazon
          Lightsail Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

OUTPUT
       bucket -> (structure)
          An object that describes the bucket that is created.

          resourceType -> (string)
              The Lightsail resource type of the bucket.

          accessRules -> (structure)
              An object that describes the access rules of the bucket.

              getObject -> (string)
                 Specifies the anonymous access to all objects in a bucket.

                 The following options can be specified:

                 o public  -  Sets  all  objects  in  the  bucket  to   public
                   (read-only),  making  them readable by anyone in the world.
                   If the getObject value is set to public , then all  objects
                   in the bucket default to public regardless of the allowPub-
                   licOverrides value.

                 o private - Sets all objects in the bucket to private, making
                   them  readable only by you or anyone you give access to. If
                   the getObject value is set to private , and the allowPubli-
                   cOverrides  value  is set to true , then all objects in the
                   bucket default to private unless they are configured with a
                   public-read  ACL. Individual objects with a public-read ACL
                   are readable by anyone in the world.

              allowPublicOverrides -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value that indicates  whether  the  access  control
                 list (ACL) permissions that are applied to individual objects
                 override the getObject option that is currently specified.

                 When this is true, you can use the PutObjectAcl Amazon S3 API
                 action  to set individual objects to public (read-only) using
                 the public-read ACL, or to private using the private ACL.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.

          bundleId -> (string)
