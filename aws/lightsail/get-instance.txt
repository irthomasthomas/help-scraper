SYNOPSIS
            get-instance
          --instance-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-name (string)
          The name of the instance.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                     protocol -> (string)
                        The IP protocol name.

                        The name can be one of the following:

                        o tcp - Transmission Control Protocol  (TCP)  provides
                          reliable,  ordered,  and  error-checked  delivery of
                          streamed data between applications running on  hosts
                          communicating  by  an IP network. If you have an ap-
                          plication that doesn't require reliable data  stream
                          service, use UDP instead.

                        o all  -  All transport layer protocol types. For more
                          general  information,   see   Transport   layer   on
                          Wikipedia .

                        o udp  -  With  User Datagram Protocol (UDP), computer
                          applications can send  messages  (or  datagrams)  to
                          other  hosts  on  an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
                          Prior communications are  not  required  to  set  up
                          transmission  channels  or  data paths. Applications
                          that don't require reliable data stream service  can
                          use  UDP,  which  provides a connectionless datagram
                          service that emphasizes reduced latency over  relia-
                          bility.  If you do require reliable data stream ser-
                          vice, use TCP instead.

                        o icmp - Internet Control Message Protocol  (ICMP)  is
                          used to send error messages and operational informa-
                          tion indicating success or failure when  communicat-
                          ing with an instance. For example, an error is indi-
                          cated when an instance could not  be  reached.  When
                          you  specify icmp as the protocol , you must specify
                          the ICMP type using the fromPort parameter, and ICMP
                          code using the toPort parameter.

                     accessFrom -> (string)
                        The  location  from which access is allowed. For exam-
                        ple, Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) , or Custom if a specific IP
                        address or range of IP addresses is allowed.

                     accessType -> (string)
                        The type of access (Public or Private ).

                     accessDirection -> (string)
                        The access direction (inbound or outbound ).

                        NOTE:
                            Lightsail  currently  supports only inbound access
                            direction.

                     cidrs -> (list)
                        The IPv4 address, or range of IPv4 addresses (in  CIDR
                        notation)  that  are allowed to connect to an instance
                        through the ports, and the protocol.

                        NOTE:
                            The ipv6Cidrs parameter lists the  IPv6  addresses
                            that are allowed to connect to an instance.

                        Classless Inter-Domain Routing on Wikipedia .

                        (string)

                     ipv6Cidrs -> (list)
                        The IPv6 address, or range of IPv6 addresses (in  CIDR
                        notation)  that  are allowed to connect to an instance
                        through the ports, and the protocol. Only devices with
                        an  IPv6  address  can  connect to an instance through
                        IPv6; otherwise, IPv4 should be used.

                        NOTE:
                            The cidrs parameter lists the IPv4 addresses  that
                            are allowed to connect to an instance.

                        An alias that defines access for a preconfigured range
                        of IP addresses.

                        The  only  alias currently supported is lightsail-con-
                        nect , which allows IP addresses of the  browser-based
                        RDP/SSH  client in the Lightsail console to connect to
                        your instance.

                        (string)

          state -> (structure)
              The status code and the state (running ) for the instance.

              code -> (integer)
                 The status code for the instance.

              name -> (string)
                 The state of the instance (running or pending ).

          username -> (string)
              The user name for connecting to the instance (ec2-user ).

          sshKeyName -> (string)
              The name of the SSH key being used to connect  to  the  instance
              (LightsailDefaultKeyPair ).

          metadataOptions -> (structure)
              The metadata options for the Amazon Lightsail instance.

              state -> (string)
                 The state of the metadata option changes.

                 The following states are possible:

                 o pending  -  The metadata options are being updated. The in-
                   stance is not yet ready to process  metadata  traffic  with
                   the new selection.

                 o applied  -  The metadata options have been successfully ap-
                   plied to the instance.

              httpTokens -> (string)
                 The state of token usage for your instance metadata requests.

                 If the state is optional , you can choose whether to retrieve
                 instance metadata with a signed token header on your request.
                 If you retrieve the IAM role credentials without a token, the
                 version  1.0  role  credentials are returned. If you retrieve
                 the IAM role credentials by using a valid signed  token,  the
                 version 2.0 role credentials are returned.

                 If  the  state  is  required  ,  you must send a signed token
                 header with all instance metadata retrieval requests. In this
                 state,  retrieving the IAM role credential always returns the
                 version 2.0 credentials. The version 1.0 credentials are  not
                 available.

                 WARNING:
                     Not  all instance blueprints in Lightsail support version
                     2.0 credentials. Use the MetadataNoToken instance  metric
                     to  track  the  number  of calls to the instance metadata
                     service that are using version 1.0 credentials. For  more
                     information,  see  Viewing  instance  metrics  in  Amazon
                     Lightsail in the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

              httpEndpoint -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the HTTP  metadata  endpoint  on  your  in-
                 stances is enabled or disabled.

                 If  the  value  is disabled , you cannot access your instance
                 metadata.

              httpPutResponseHopLimit -> (integer)
                 The desired HTTP PUT response hop limit for instance metadata
                 requests.  A  larger  number means that the instance metadata
