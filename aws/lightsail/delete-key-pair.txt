DELETE-KEY-PAIR()                                            DELETE-KEY-PAIR()



NAME
       delete-key-pair -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified key pair by removing the public key from Amazon
       Lightsail.

       You can delete key pairs that were created using the ImportKeyPair  and
       CreateKeyPair actions, as well as the Lightsail default key pair. A new
       default key pair will not be created  unless  you  launch  an  instance
       without   specifying   a   custom   key   pair,   or   you   call   the
       DownloadDefaultKeyPair API.

       The delete key pair operation supports tag-based access control via re-
       source  tags  applied to the resource identified by key pair name . For
       more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-key-pair
          --key-pair-name <value>
          [--expected-fingerprint <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-pair-name (string)
          The name of the key pair to delete.

       --expected-fingerprint (string)
          The RSA fingerprint of the Lightsail default key pair to delete.

          NOTE:
              The expectedFingerprint parameter is required only when specify-
              ing to delete a Lightsail default key pair.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a key pair

       The following delete-key-pair example deletes the specified key pair.
