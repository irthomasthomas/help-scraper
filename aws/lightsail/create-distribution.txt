OPTIONS
       --distribution-name (string)
          The name for the distribution.

       --origin (structure)
          An  object  that describes the origin resource for the distribution,
          such as a Lightsail instance, bucket, or load balancer.

          The distribution pulls, caches, and serves content from the origin.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the origin resource.

          regionName -> (string)
              The AWS Region name of the origin resource.

          protocolPolicy -> (string)
              The protocol that your Amazon Lightsail distribution  uses  when
              establishing a connection with your origin to pull content.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,regionName=string,protocolPolicy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "regionName": "us-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"eu-central-1"|"ca-central-1"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"eu-north-1",
            "protocolPolicy": "http-only"|"https-only"
          }

       --default-cache-behavior (structure)
          An  object that describes the default cache behavior for the distri-
          bution.

          behavior -> (string)
              The cache behavior of the distribution.

              The following cache behaviors can be specified:

              o

                **
                cache ** - This option is best for static sites.  When  speci-
                fied,  your distribution caches and serves your entire website
                as static content. This behavior is ideal  for  websites  with
                static  content that doesn't change depending on who views it,
                or for websites that don't  use  cookies,  headers,  or  query
                strings to personalize content.

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 153)
                Inline strong start-string without end-string.

              o

                **
                dont-cache ** - This option is best for sites that serve a mix
                of static and dynamic content. When specified, your  distribu-
                tion  caches  and  serve only the content that is specified in
                the distribution's CacheBehaviorPerPath parameter. This behav-
                ior  is  ideal for websites or web applications that use cook-
                ies, headers, and query strings to personalize content for in-
                dividual users.

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 155)
                Inline strong start-string without end-string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          behavior=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "behavior": "dont-cache"|"cache"
          }

       --cache-behavior-settings (structure)
          An object that describes the cache behavior settings for the distri-
          bution.

          defaultTTL -> (long)
              The default amount of time that objects stay  in  the  distribu-
              tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request to
              the origin to determine whether the content has been updated.

              NOTE:
                 The value specified applies only when the origin does not add
                 HTTP  headers  such  as Cache-Control max-age , Cache-Control
                 s-maxage , and Expires to objects.

          minimumTTL -> (long)
              The minimum amount of time that objects stay  in  the  distribu-
              tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request to
              the origin to determine whether the object has been updated.

              A value of 0 must be specified for minimumTTL if  the  distribu-
              tion is configured to forward all headers to the origin.

          maximumTTL -> (long)
              The  maximum  amount  of time that objects stay in the distribu-
              tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request to
              the origin to determine whether the object has been updated.

              The value specified applies only when the origin adds HTTP head-
              ers such as Cache-Control max-age , Cache-Control s-maxage , and
              Expires to objects.

          allowedHTTPMethods -> (string)
              The HTTP methods that are processed and forwarded to the distri-
              bution's origin.

              You can specify the following options:

              o GET,HEAD - The distribution forwards the GET and HEAD methods.

              o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS - The distribution forwards the GET , HEAD  ,
                and OPTIONS methods.

              o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE - The distribution for-
                wards the GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PUT ,  PATCH  ,  POST  ,  and
                DELETE methods.

              If  you specify the third option, you might need to restrict ac-
              cess to your distribution's origin so users can't perform opera-
              tions  that  you  don't want them to. For example, you might not
              want users to have permission to delete objects from  your  ori-
              gin.

          cachedHTTPMethods -> (string)
              The HTTP method responses that are cached by your distribution.

              You can specify the following options:

              o GET,HEAD  -  The  distribution caches responses to the GET and
                HEAD methods.

              o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS - The distribution caches  responses  to  the
                GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS methods.

          forwardedCookies -> (structure)
              An  object  that describes the cookies that are forwarded to the
              origin. Your content is cached based on  the  cookies  that  are
              forwarded.

              option -> (string)
                 Specifies which cookies to forward to the distribution's ori-
                 gin for a cache behavior: all , none , or allow-list to  for-
                 ward  only  the cookies specified in the cookiesAllowList pa-
                 rameter.

              cookiesAllowList -> (list)
                 The specific cookies to forward to your  distribution's  ori-
                 gin.

       --cache-behaviors (list)
          An array of objects that describe the per-path  cache  behavior  for
          the distribution.

          (structure)
              Describes  the  per-path  cache  behavior of an Amazon Lightsail
              content delivery network (CDN) distribution.

              A per-path cache behavior is used to override, or add an  excep-
              tion to, the default cache behavior of a distribution. For exam-
              ple, if the cacheBehavior is set to  cache  ,  then  a  per-path
              cache behavior can be used to specify a directory, file, or file
              type that your distribution will cache. Alternately, if the dis-
              tribution's  cacheBehavior is dont-cache , then a per-path cache
              behavior can be used to specify a directory, file, or file  type
              that your distribution will not cache.

              path -> (string)
                 The  path to a directory or file to cached, or not cache. Use
                 an  asterisk   symbol   to   specify   wildcard   directories
                 (path/to/assets/* ), and file types (*.html, *jpg, *js ). Di-
                 rectories and file paths are case-sensitive.

                 Examples:

                 o Specify the following to cache all files  in  the  document
                   root  of  an  Apache  web server running on a Lightsail in-
                   stance.  var/www/html/

                 o Specify the following file to cache only the index page  in
                   the    document    root    of   an   Apache   web   server.
                   var/www/html/index.html

                 o Specify the following to cache only the .html files in  the
                   document root of an Apache web server.  var/www/html/*.html

                 o Specify  the  following  to  cache only the .jpg, .png, and
                   .gif files in the images sub-directory of the document root
                   of   an   Apache   web  server.   var/www/html/images/*.jpg
                   var/www/html/images/*.png         var/www/html/images/*.gif
                   Specify  the  following  to  cache  all files in the images
                   sub-directory of the document root of an Apache web server.
                   var/www/html/images/

              behavior -> (string)
                 The cache behavior for the specified path.

                 You  can  specify  one of the following per-path cache behav-
                 iors:

                 o

                   **
                   cache ** - This behavior caches the specified path.

                 The following cache behaviors can be specified:

                 o

                   **
                   cache ** - This option is best for static sites. When spec-
                   ified, your distribution caches and serves your entire web-
                   site as static content. This behavior is ideal for websites
                   with  static  content  that doesn't change depending on who
                   views it, or for websites that don't use cookies,  headers,
                   or query strings to personalize content.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 994)
                   Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                 o

                   **
                   dont-cache  ** - This option is best for sites that serve a
                   mix of static and dynamic  content.  When  specified,  your
                   distribution  caches  and  serve  only  the content that is
                   specified in the distribution's CacheBehaviorPerPath param-
                   eter.  This  behavior is ideal for websites or web applica-
                   tions that use cookies, headers, and query strings to  per-
                   sonalize content for individual users.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 996)
                   Inline strong start-string without end-string.

              tribution.

              defaultTTL -> (long)
                 The default amount of time that objects stay in the distribu-
                 tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request
                 to the origin to determine whether the content has  been  up-
                 dated.

                 NOTE:
                     The value specified applies only when the origin does not
                     add  HTTP  headers  such  as  Cache-Control   max-age   ,
                     Cache-Control s-maxage , and Expires to objects.

              minimumTTL -> (long)
                 The minimum amount of time that objects stay in the distribu-
                 tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request
                 to  the  origin  to determine whether the object has been up-
                 dated.

                 A value of 0 must be specified for minimumTTL if the  distri-
                 bution is configured to forward all headers to the origin.

              maximumTTL -> (long)
                 The maximum amount of time that objects stay in the distribu-
                 tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request
                 to  the  origin  to determine whether the object has been up-
                 dated.

                 The value specified applies only when the  origin  adds  HTTP
                 headers  such as Cache-Control max-age , Cache-Control s-max-
                 age , and Expires to objects.

              allowedHTTPMethods -> (string)
                 The HTTP methods that are processed and forwarded to the dis-
                 tribution's origin.

                 You can specify the following options:

                 o GET,HEAD - The distribution forwards the GET and HEAD meth-
                   ods.

                 o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS - The distribution forwards the GET , HEAD
                   , and OPTIONS methods.

                 o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE  -  The distribution
                   forwards the GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PUT , PATCH  ,  POST  ,
                   and DELETE methods.

                 If  you  specify the third option, you might need to restrict
                 access to your distribution's origin so users  can't  perform
                 operations  that  you  don't  want  them to. For example, you
                 might not want users to have  permission  to  delete  objects
                 from your origin.

              cachedHTTPMethods -> (string)
                 The  HTTP  method responses that are cached by your distribu-
                 tion.

                 You can specify the following options:

                 o GET,HEAD - The distribution caches responses to the GET and
                   HEAD methods.

                 o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS - The distribution caches responses to the
                   GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS methods.

              forwardedCookies -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the cookies that  are  forwarded  to
                 the  origin. Your content is cached based on the cookies that
                 are forwarded.

                 option -> (string)
                     Specifies which cookies to forward to the  distribution's
                     origin  for  a cache behavior: all , none , or allow-list
                     to forward only the cookies specified in  the  cookiesAl-
                     lowList parameter.

                 cookiesAllowList -> (list)
                     The  specific  cookies  to forward to your distribution's
                     origin.

                     (string)

              forwardedHeaders -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the headers that  are  forwarded  to
                 the  origin. Your content is cached based on the headers that
                 are forwarded.

                 option -> (string)
                     The headers that you want your distribution to forward to
                     your origin and base caching on.

                     You can configure your distribution to do one of the fol-
                     lowing:

                     o

                       **

                     o

                       **
                       allow-list ** - Forward only the  headers  you  specify
                       using the headersAllowList parameter.

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 1172)

                 headersAllowList -> (list)
                     The  specific  headers  to forward to your distribution's
                     origin.

                     (string)

              forwardedQueryStrings -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the query strings that are forwarded
                 to  the  origin.  Your  content  is cached based on the query

                 option -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the distribution  forwards  and  caches
                     based on query strings.

                     fied query strings.

                     If  the  option parameter is true, then your distribution
                     forwards all query strings, regardless of what you  spec-
                     ify using the queryStringsAllowList parameter.

                     (string)

          cacheBehaviors -> (list)
              An array of objects that describe the per-path cache behavior of
              the distribution.

              (structure)
                 Describes the per-path cache behavior of an Amazon  Lightsail
                 content delivery network (CDN) distribution.

                 A  per-path cache behavior is used to override, or add an ex-
                 ception to, the default cache behavior of a distribution. For
                 example,  if  the  cacheBehavior  is  set  to  cache , then a
                 per-path cache behavior can be used to specify  a  directory,
                 file,  or file type that your distribution will cache. Alter-
                 nately, if the distribution's cacheBehavior is  dont-cache  ,
                 then  a  per-path cache behavior can be used to specify a di-
                 rectory, file, or file type that your distribution  will  not
                 cache.

                 path -> (string)
                     The  path to a directory or file to cached, or not cache.
                     Use an asterisk symbol to  specify  wildcard  directories
                     (path/to/assets/* ), and file types (*.html, *jpg, *js ).
                     Directories and file paths are case-sensitive.

                     Examples:

                     o Specify the following to cache all files in  the  docu-
                       ment  root  of an Apache web server running on a Light-

                       ages/*.jpg                    var/www/html/images/*.png
                       var/www/html/images/*.gif   Specify  the  following  to
                       cache all files in the images sub-directory of the doc-
                       ument root of an Apache web  server.   var/www/html/im-
                       ages/

                       **
                       dont-cache ** - This behavior doesn't cache the  speci-
                       fied path.

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 1304)
