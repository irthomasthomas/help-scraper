       --report-format (string)
          The format to generate the report in.

          Possible values:

          o CSV

          o JSON

       --s3-destination (structure)
          The Amazon S3 export destination for the report.

          bucketName -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to export findings to.

          keyPrefix -> (string)
              The prefix that the findings will be written under.

          kmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt data when exporting find-
              ings.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucketName=string,keyPrefix=string,kmsKeyArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucketName": "string",
            "keyPrefix": "string",
            "kmsKeyArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a findings report

       The following create-findings-report example creates a finding report.

          aws inspector2 create-findings-report \
              --report-format CSV \
              --s3-destination bucketName=inspector-sbom-123456789012,keyPrefix=sbom-key,kmsKeyArn=arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE33333 \
              --filter-criteria '{"ecrImageRepositoryName":[{"comparison":"EQUALS","value":"debian"}]}'

       Output:

          {
              "reportId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE33333"
          }

       For more information, see Managing findings in Amazon Inspector in  the
       Amazon Inspector User Guide.

OUTPUT
       reportId -> (string)
          The ID of the report.
