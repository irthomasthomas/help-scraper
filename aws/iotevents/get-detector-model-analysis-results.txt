NAME
       get-detector-model-analysis-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves one or more analysis results of the detector model.

       NOTE:
          After  AWS IoT Events starts analyzing your detector model, you have
          up to 24 hours to retrieve the analysis results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --analysis-id (string)
          The ID of the analysis result that you want to retrieve.

       --next-token (string)
          The token that you can use to return the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned per request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       analysisResults -> (list)
          Contains information about one or more analysis results.

          (structure)
              Contains the result of the analysis.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type of the analysis result. Analyses fall into the fol-
                 lowing types based on the validators  used  to  generate  the
                 analysis result:

                 o supported-actions  -  You  must specify AWS IoT Events sup-
                   ported actions that work with other AWS services in a  sup-
                   ported AWS Region.

                 o service-limits  -  Resources or API operations can't exceed
                   service quotas (also known as limits). Update your detector
                   model or request a quota increase.

                 o structure - The detector model must follow a structure that
                   AWS IoT Events supports.

                 o expression-syntax - Your expression  must  follow  the  re-
                   quired syntax.

                 o data-type  -  Data  types  referenced in the detector model
                   must be compatible.

                 o referenced-data - You must define the  data  referenced  in
                   your detector model before you can use the data.

                 o referenced-resource  -  Resources  that  the detector model
                   uses must be available.

                 For more information, see Running detector model analyses  in
                 the AWS IoT Events Developer Guide .

              level -> (string)
                 The  severity  level  of  the  analysis  result. Based on the
                 severity level, analysis results fall into three general cat-
                 egories:

                 o INFO  - An information result tells you about a significant
                   field in your detector model. This type of  result  usually
                   doesn't require immediate action.

                 o WARNING  -  A  warning  result  draws  special attention to
                   fields that might cause issues for your detector model.  We
                   recommend  that  you review warnings and take necessary ac-
                   tions before you use your detector model in production  en-
                   vironments. Otherwise, the detector model might not work as
                   expected.

                 o ERROR - An error result notifies you about a problem  found
                   in  your detector model. You must fix all errors before you
                   can publish your detector model.

              message -> (string)
                 Contains additional information about the analysis result.

              locations -> (list)
                 Contains one or more locations that you can use to locate the
                 fields in your detector model that the analysis result refer-
                 ences.

                 (structure)
                     Contains information that you can use to locate the field
                     in  your  detector  model that the analysis result refer-
                     ences.

                     path -> (string)
                        A JsonPath expression that identifies the error  field
                        in your detector model.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token  that  you  can use to return the next set of results, or
          null if there are no more results.
