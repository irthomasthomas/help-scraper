CREATE-CHANNEL-MEMBERSHIP()                        CREATE-CHANNEL-MEMBERSHIP()



NAME
       create-channel-membership -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a  user to a channel. The InvitedBy field in ChannelMembership is
       derived from the request header. A channel member can:

       o List messages

       o Send messages

       o Receive messages

       o Edit their own messages

       o Leave the channel

       Privacy settings impact this action as follows:

       o Public Channels: You do not need to be a member to list messages, but
         you must be a member to send messages.

       o Private Channels: You must be a member to list or send messages.

       NOTE:
          The  x-amz-chime-bearer  request header is mandatory. Use the AppIn-
          stanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call as  the  value  in
          the header.

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel to which you're adding users.

       --member-arn (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the member you want to add to the channel.

       --type (string)
          The  membership  type of a user, DEFAULT or HIDDEN . Default members
          are always returned as part of ListChannelMemberships . Hidden  mem-
          bers  are only returned if the type filter in ListChannelMemberships
          equals HIDDEN . Otherwise hidden members are not returned.  This  is
          only supported by moderators.

          Possible values:

          o DEFAULT

          o HIDDEN

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call.

       --sub-channel-id (string)
          The ID of the SubChannel in the request.

          NOTE:
              Only  required  when  creating  membership in a SubChannel for a
              moderator in an elastic channel.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)
