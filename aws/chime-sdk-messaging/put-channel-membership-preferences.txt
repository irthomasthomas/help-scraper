NAME
       put-channel-membership-preferences -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the membership preferences of an AppInstanceUser or AppInstanceBot
       for the specified channel. The user or bot must  be  a  member  of  the
       channel.  Only  the user or bot who owns the membership can set prefer-
       ences. Users or bots in  the  AppInstanceAdmin  and  channel  moderator
       roles can't set preferences for other users. Banned users or bots can't
       set membership preferences for the channel from which they are banned.

       NOTE:
          The x-amz-chime-bearer request header is mandatory. Use the  ARN  of
          an  AppInstanceUser or AppInstanceBot that makes the API call as the
          value in the header.

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel.

       --member-arn (string)
          The ARN of the member setting the preferences.

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The ARN of the AppInstanceUser or AppInstanceBot that makes the  API
          call.

       --preferences (structure)
          The channel membership preferences of an AppInstanceUser .

          PushNotifications -> (structure)
              The push notification configuration of a message.

              AllowNotifications -> (string)
                 Enum value that indicates which push notifications to send to
                 the requested member of a channel. ALL sends all push notifi-
                 cations,  NONE  sends  no  push notifications, FILTERED sends
                 only filtered push notifications.

              FilterRule -> (string)
                 The simple JSON object used to send a subset of a push  noti-
                 fication to the requested member.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PushNotifications={AllowNotifications=string,FilterRule=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PushNotifications": {
              "AllowNotifications": "ALL"|"NONE"|"FILTERED",
              "FilterRule": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
