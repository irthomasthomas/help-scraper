OPTIONS
       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the user making the API call.

       --fields (list)
          A list of the Field objects in the channel being searched.

          (structure)
              A Field of the channel that you want to search.

              Key -> (string)
                 An  enum  value  that indicates the key to search the channel
                 on. MEMBERS allows you to search channels  based  on  member-
                 ships.  You  can use it with the EQUALS operator to get chan-
                 nels whose memberships are equal to the specified values, and
                 with  the INCLUDES operator to get channels whose memberships
                 include the specified values.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values that you want to search for, a  list  of  strings.
                 The values must be AppInstanceUserArns specified as a list of
                 strings.

                 NOTE:
                     This operation isn't supported for AppInstanceUsers  with
                     large number of memberships.

                 (string)

              Operator -> (string)
                 The  operator  used to compare field values, currently EQUALS
                 or INCLUDES . Use the EQUALS operator to find channels  whose
                 memberships  equal the specified values. Use the INCLUDES op-
                 erator to find channels whose memberships include the  speci-
                 fied values.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "MEMBERS",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Operator": "EQUALS"|"INCLUDES"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of channels that you want returned.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  returned  from previous API requests until the number of
          channels is reached.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
