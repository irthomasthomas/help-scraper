NAME
       list-channel-memberships -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all channel memberships in a channel.

       NOTE:
          The  x-amz-chime-bearer  request header is mandatory. Use the ARN of
          the AppInstanceUser or AppInstanceBot that makes the API call as the
          value in the header.

       If  you want to list the channels to which a specific app instance user
       belongs, see the ListChannelMembershipsForAppInstanceUser API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The maximum number of channel memberships that you want returned.

       --type (string)
          The membership type of a user, DEFAULT or HIDDEN .  Default  members
          are  returned as part of ListChannelMemberships if no type is speci-
          fied. Hidden members  are  only  returned  if  the  type  filter  in
          ListChannelMemberships equals HIDDEN .

          Possible values:

          o DEFAULT

          o HIDDEN

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of channel memberships that you want returned.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  passed by previous API calls until all requested channel
          memberships are returned.

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The ARN of the AppInstanceUser or AppInstanceBot that makes the  API
          call.

       --sub-channel-id (string)
          The ID of the SubChannel in the request.

          NOTE:
              Only  required when listing a user's memberships in a particular
              sub-channel of an elastic channel.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
