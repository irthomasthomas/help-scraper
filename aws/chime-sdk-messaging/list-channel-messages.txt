LIST-CHANNEL-MESSAGES()                                LIST-CHANNEL-MESSAGES()



NAME
       list-channel-messages -

DESCRIPTION
       List  all  the messages in a channel. Returns a paginated list of Chan-
       nelMessages . By default, sorted by creation  timestamp  in  descending
       order.

       NOTE:
          Redacted  messages  appear  in  the results as empty, since they are
          only redacted, not deleted. Deleted messages do not  appear  in  the
          results.  This action always returns the latest version of an edited
          message.

          Also, the x-amz-chime-bearer request header is  mandatory.  Use  the
          ARN of the AppInstanceUser or AppInstanceBot that makes the API call
          as the value in the header.

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel.

       --sort-order (string)
          The order in which you want messages sorted. Default is  Descending,
          based on time created.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --not-before (timestamp)
          The initial or starting time stamp for your requested messages.

       --not-after (timestamp)
          The final or ending time stamp for your requested messages.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of messages that you want returned.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token passed by previous API calls until all requested messages
          are returned.

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The ARN of the AppInstanceUser or AppInstanceBot that makes the  API
          call.

       --sub-channel-id (string)
          The ID of the SubChannel in the request.

          NOTE:
              Only required when listing the messages in a SubChannel that the
              user belongs to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
