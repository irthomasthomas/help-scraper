SYNOPSIS
            describe-channel-flow
          --channel-flow-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-flow-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel flow.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ChannelFlow -> (structure)
          The channel flow details.

          ChannelFlowArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the channel flow.

          Processors -> (list)
              Information about the processor Lambda functions.

              (structure)
                 The information about a processor in a channel flow.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the channel flow.

                 Configuration -> (structure)
                     The information about the type of processor and its iden-
                     tifier.

                     Lambda -> (structure)
                        Indicates that the processor is of type Lambda.

                        ResourceArn -> (string)
                            The ARN of the Lambda message processing function.

                        InvocationType -> (string)
                            Controls how the Lambda function is invoked.

                 ExecutionOrder -> (integer)
                     The sequence in which processors run. If you have  multi-
                     ple processors in a channel flow, message processing goes
                     through each processor in the sequence. The value  deter-
                     mines the sequence. At this point, we support only 1 pro-
                     cessor within a flow.

                 FallbackAction -> (string)
                     Determines whether to continue with message processing or
                     stop  it  in  cases  where communication with a processor
                     fails. If a processor has a fallback action of ABORT  and
                     communication  with it fails, the processor sets the mes-
                     sage status to FAILED and does not send  the  message  to
                     any  recipients.  Note  that if the last processor in the
                     channel flow sequence has a fallback action  of  CONTINUE
                     and communication with the processor fails, then the mes-
                     sage is considered processed and sent  to  recipients  of
                     the channel.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the channel flow.

          CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the channel flow was created.

          LastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which a channel flow was updated.
