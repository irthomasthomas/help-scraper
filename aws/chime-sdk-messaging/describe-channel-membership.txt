SYNOPSIS
            describe-channel-membership
          --channel-arn <value>
          --member-arn <value>
          --chime-bearer <value>
          [--sub-channel-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel.

       --member-arn (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the member.

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call.

       --sub-channel-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the SubChannel in the request. The response contains an
          ElasticChannelConfiguration object.

          NOTE:
              Only required to get a users SubChannel membership details.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
