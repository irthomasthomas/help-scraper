GET-DEVICE()                                                      GET-DEVICE()



NAME
       get-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the devices available in Amazon Braket.

       NOTE:
          For  backwards  compatibility  with older versions of BraketSchemas,
          OpenQASM information is omitted from GetDevice  API  calls.  To  get
          this information the user-agent needs to present a recent version of
          the BraketSchemas (1.8.0 or later). The Braket SDK automatically re-
          ports this for you. If you do not see OpenQASM results in the GetDe-
          vice response when using a Braket SDK, you may need to set  AWS_EXE-
          CUTION_ENV  environment  variable  to  configure user-agent. See the
          code examples provided below for how to do this  for  the  AWS  CLI,
          Boto3, and the Go, Java, and JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs.

OPTIONS
       --device-arn (string)
          The ARN of the device to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       deviceArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the device.

       deviceCapabilities -> (string)
          Details about the capabilities of the device.

       deviceName -> (string)
          The name of the device.

       deviceQueueInfo -> (list)
          List of information about tasks and jobs queued on a device.

          (structure)
              Information about tasks and jobs queued on a device.

              queue -> (string)
                 The name of the queue.

              queuePriority -> (string)
                 Optional.  Specifies  the  priority  of the queue. Tasks in a
                 priority queue are processed before the  tasks  in  a  normal
                 queue.

              queueSize -> (string)
                 The number of jobs or tasks in the queue for a given device.

       deviceStatus -> (string)
          The status of the device.

       deviceType -> (string)
          The type of the device.

       providerName -> (string)
          The name of the partner company for the device.
