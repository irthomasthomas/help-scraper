GET-DEVICE()                                                      GET-DEVICE()



NAME
       get-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the devices available in Amazon Braket.

       NOTE:
          For  backwards  compatibility  with older versions of BraketSchemas,
          OpenQASM information is omitted from GetDevice  API  calls.  To  get
          this information the user-agent needs to present a recent version of
          the BraketSchemas (1.8.0 or later). The Braket SDK automatically re-
          ports this for you. If you do not see OpenQASM results in the GetDe-
          vice response when using a Braket SDK, you may need to set  AWS_EXE-
          CUTION_ENV  environment  variable  to  configure user-agent. See the
          code examples provided below for how to do this  for  the  AWS  CLI,
          Boto3, and the Go, Java, and JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs.

SYNOPSIS
            get-device
          --device-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --device-arn (string)
          The ARN of the device to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       deviceArn -> (string)

       deviceName -> (string)
          The name of the device.

       deviceStatus -> (string)
          The status of the device.

       deviceType -> (string)
