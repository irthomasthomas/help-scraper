DELETE-SCHEDULE-GROUP()                                DELETE-SCHEDULE-GROUP()



NAME
       delete-schedule-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified schedule group. Deleting a schedule group results
       in EventBridge Scheduler deleting all  schedules  associated  with  the
       group.  When  you  delete a group, it remains in a DELETING state until
       all of its associated schedules are deleted. Schedules associated  with
       the  group  that  are  set  to  run  while the schedule group is in the
       process of being deleted might continue to invoke their  targets  until
       the schedule group and its associated schedules are deleted.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idempo-
          tency of the request. If you do not specify a client  token,  Event-
          Bridge  Scheduler uses a randomly generated token for the request to
          ensure idempotency.

       --name (string)
          The name of the schedule group to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
