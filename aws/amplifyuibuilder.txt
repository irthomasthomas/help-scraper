DESCRIPTION
       The Amplify UI Builder API provides a programmatic interface for creat-
       ing and configuring user interface (UI) component libraries and  themes
       for  use  in  your  Amplify applications. You can then connect these UI
       components to an application's backend Amazon Web Services resources.

       You can also use the Amplify Studio visual designer to create UI compo-
       nents and model data for an app. For more information, see Introduction
       in the Amplify Docs .

       The Amplify Framework is a comprehensive set of SDKs, libraries, tools,
       and documentation for client app development. For more information, see
       the Amplify Framework . For more information about deploying an Amplify
       application to Amazon Web Services, see the Amplify User Guide .
