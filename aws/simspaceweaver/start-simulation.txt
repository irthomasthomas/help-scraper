OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  value  that you provide to ensure that repeated calls to this API
          operation using the same parameters complete only once. A  ClientTo-
          ken  is  also  known as an idempotency token . A ClientToken expires
          after 24 hours.

       --description (string)
          The description of the simulation.

       --maximum-duration (string)
          The maximum running time of the simulation, specified as a number of
          minutes  (m  or M), hours (h or H), or days (d or D). The simulation
          stops when it reaches this limit. The maximum value is 14D , or  its
          equivalent  in  the  other units. The default value is 14D . A value
          equivalent to 0 makes the simulation immediately transition to Stop-
          ping as soon as it reaches Started .

       --name (string)
          The name of the simulation.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that the simulation assumes to perform actions. For  more
          information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Ama-
          zon Web Services General Reference . For more information about  IAM
          roles,  see  IAM  roles  in  the Identity and Access Management User
          Guide .

       --schema-s3-location (structure)

          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html`__
          .

          Provide a SchemaS3Location to start your simulation from a schema.

          If you provide a SchemaS3Location then you  can't  provide  a  Snap-
          shotS3Location .

              buckets in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

          ObjectKey -> (string)

       --snapshot-s3-location (structure)
          The location of the snapshot .zip file in Amazon Simple Storage Ser-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the simulation. For more  informa-
          tion  about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web
          Services General Reference .

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time when the simulation was created, expressed as the number of
          seconds  and  milliseconds  in  UTC since the Unix epoch (0:0:0.000,
