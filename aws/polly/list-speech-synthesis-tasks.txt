NAME
       list-speech-synthesis-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of SpeechSynthesisTask objects ordered by their creation
       date. This operation can filter the tasks by their status, for example,
       allowing users to list only tasks that are completed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-speech-synthesis-tasks  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: SynthesisTasks

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          Status of the speech synthesis tasks returned in a List operation

          Possible values:

          o scheduled

          o inProgress

          o completed

          o failed

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An opaque pagination token returned from the previous List operation
          in this request. If present, this indicates where  to  continue  the
          listing.

       SynthesisTasks -> (list)
          List  of  SynthesisTask  objects  that provides information from the
          specified task in the list request, including  output  format,  cre-
          ation time, task status, and so on.

              synthesis task.

              Engine -> (string)
                 Specifies the engine (standard , neural or  long-form  )  for
                 Amazon  Polly  to  use  when processing input text for speech
                 synthesis. Using a voice that is not supported for the engine
                 selected will result in an error.

                 Current status of the individual speech synthesis task.

              TaskStatusReason -> (string)
                 Reason for the current status of a specific speech  synthesis
                 task, including errors if the task has failed.

              OutputUri -> (string)
                 Pathway for the output speech file.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)

              SnsTopicArn -> (string)
                 ARN  for  the  SNS topic optionally used for providing status
                 notification for a speech synthesis task.

              LexiconNames -> (list)
                 List of one or more pronunciation lexicon names you want  the
                 service  to apply during synthesis. Lexicons are applied only
                 if the language of the lexicon is the same as the language of
                 the voice.

                 (string)

              OutputFormat -> (string)
                 The  format in which the returned output will be encoded. For
                 audio stream, this will  be  mp3,  ogg_vorbis,  or  pcm.  For
                 speech marks, this will be json.

              SampleRate -> (string)
                 The audio frequency specified in Hz.

                 The  valid values for mp3 and ogg_vorbis are "8000", "16000",
                 "22050", and "24000". The default value for  standard  voices
                 is  "22050".  The default value for neural voices is "24000".
                 The default value for long-form voices is "24000".

                 Valid values for pcm are "8000" and "16000" The default value
                 is "16000".

              SpeechMarkTypes -> (list)
                 The type of speech marks returned for the input text.

                 (string)

              TextType -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  the input text is plain text or SSML. The
                 default value is plain text.

              VoiceId -> (string)
                 Voice ID to use for the synthesis.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 Optional language code for a synthesis  task.  This  is  only
                 necessary  if  using  a bilingual voice, such as Aditi, which
                 can be used  for  either  Indian  English  (en-IN)  or  Hindi
                 (hi-IN).

                 If  a  bilingual voice is used and no language code is speci-
                 fied, Amazon Polly uses the default language of the bilingual
                 voice. The default language for any voice is the one returned
                 by the DescribeVoices operation for the LanguageCode  parame-
                 ter.  For  example,  if  no language code is specified, Aditi
                 will use Indian English rather than Hindi.
