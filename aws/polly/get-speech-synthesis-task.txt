OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          The Amazon Polly generated identifier for a speech synthesis task.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       SynthesisTask -> (structure)
          SynthesisTask object that provides information  from  the  requested
          task,  including  output  format, creation time, task status, and so
          on.

          Engine -> (string)
              Specifies the engine (standard , neural or long-form ) for  Ama-
              zon  Polly  to use when processing input text for speech synthe-
              sis. Using a voice that is not supported for the engine selected
              will result in an error.

          TaskId -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Polly  generated  identifier for a speech synthesis
              task.

          TaskStatus -> (string)
              Current status of the individual speech synthesis task.

          TaskStatusReason -> (string)
              Reason for the current status of  a  specific  speech  synthesis
              task, including errors if the task has failed.

          OutputUri -> (string)
              Pathway for the output speech file.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp for the time the synthesis task was started.

          RequestCharacters -> (integer)
              Number of billable characters synthesized.

          SnsTopicArn -> (string)
              ARN for the SNS topic optionally used for providing status noti-
              fication for a speech synthesis task.

          LexiconNames -> (list)
              List of one or more pronunciation lexicon  names  you  want  the
              service  to apply during synthesis. Lexicons are applied only if
              the language of the lexicon is the same as the language  of  the
              voice.

              (string)

          OutputFormat -> (string)
              The format in which the returned output will be encoded. For au-
              dio stream, this will be mp3, ogg_vorbis,  or  pcm.  For  speech
              marks, this will be json.

          SampleRate -> (string)
              The audio frequency specified in Hz.

              The  valid  values  for  mp3 and ogg_vorbis are "8000", "16000",
              "22050", and "24000". The default value for standard  voices  is
              "22050". The default value for neural voices is "24000". The de-
              fault value for long-form voices is "24000".

              Valid values for pcm are "8000" and "16000" The default value is
              "16000".

          SpeechMarkTypes -> (list)
              The type of speech marks returned for the input text.

              (string)

          TextType -> (string)
              Specifies  whether the input text is plain text or SSML. The de-
              fault value is plain text.

          VoiceId -> (string)
              Voice ID to use for the synthesis.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              Optional language code for a synthesis task. This is only neces-
              sary  if  using  a  bilingual voice, such as Aditi, which can be
              used for either Indian English (en-IN) or Hindi (hi-IN).

              If a bilingual voice is used and no language code is  specified,
              Amazon  Polly  uses the default language of the bilingual voice.
              The default language for any voice is the one  returned  by  the
              DescribeVoices operation for the LanguageCode parameter. For ex-
              ample, if no language code is specified, Aditi will  use  Indian
              English rather than Hindi.
